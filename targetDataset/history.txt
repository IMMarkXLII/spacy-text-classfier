 the outbreak of the french revolution  changes after revolution  classes of french societies  facts about napoleon the former emperor of france
the french society during the late th century- the french society comprised  st estate clergy nd estate nobility rd estate big businessmen merchants court officials peasants artisans landless laborers servants etc
some within the third estate were rich and some were poor
the burden of financing activities of the state through taxes was borne by the third estate alone
the struggle for survival population of france grew and so did the demand for grains
the gap between the rich and poor widened
this led to subsistence crises
the growing middle class this estate was educated and believed that no group in society should be privileged by birth
these ideas were put forward by philosophers such as locke the english philosopher and rousseau the french philosopher
the american constitution and its guarantee of individual rights was an important example of political theories of france
these ideas were discussed intensively in salons and coffee houses and spread among people through books and newspapers
these were even read aloud

women’s revolution  from the very beginning women were active participants in the events which brought about so many changes in french society
 most of the women of the third estate had to work for a living
 their wages were lower than those of men
 they demanded equal pay for equal work
 in order to discuss and voice their interests women started their own political clubs and newspapers
 one of their main demands was that women must enjoy the same political rights as men
 some laws were introduced to improve the position of women
 their struggle still continues in several parts of the world

the revolution and everyday life  the years following  in france saw many changes in the lives of men women and children
 the revolutionary governments took it upon themselves to pass laws that would translate the ideals of liberty and equality into everyday practice
 one important law that came into effect was the abolition of censorship
 the ideas of liberty and democratic rights were the most important legacy of the french revolution
these spread from france to the rest of europe during the th century
napoleon  in  napoleon crowned himself emperor of france
 he set out to conquer neighboring european countries dispossessing dynasties and creating kingdoms where he placed members of his family

 progress of russian revolution  the first world war and the russian revolution  events and effects of february and october revolution of russia  social changes that were taken place in russia
the age of social change the french revolution opened up the possibility of creating a dramatic change in the way in which society was structured
not everyone in europe however wanted a complete transformation
some were ‘conservatives’ while others were ‘liberals’ or ‘radicals’
liberals wanted a nation which tolerated all religions
they argued for an elected parliamentary government subject to laws interpreted by a well-trained judiciary that was independent of rulers and officials
radicals wanted a nation in which government was based on the majority of a country’s population
they disliked the concentration of property in the hands of a few not the existence of private property
after the revolution they started accepting change provided it was slow and had links and respected the past
industries and social change this was the time of economic and social change
men women and children were pushed into factories for low wages
liberals and radicals who were factory owners felt that workers’ efforts must be encouraged
socialism in europe socialists were against private property
they had different visions of the future
some believed in cooperatives some demanded that governments must encourage cooperatives
marx believed that a socialist society would free workers from capitalism
this would be a communist society in which collective ownership of land and factories would be promoted
socialism given support workers in germany and england began forming associations to fight for better living conditions
they set up funds for members in distress reduction of working hours and right to vote
the russian revolution in  tzar nicholas ii ruled the russian empire
economy and society most of the russian population were agriculturalist
industries were being set up which were mostly private property of the industrialists
workers were divided into groups but they did unite to strike work when they were dissatisfied
peasants had no respect for nobility unlike the french peasant
russian peasants were the only peasant community which pooled their land and their commune divided the land according to the needs of individual families
socialism in russia all the political parties were illegal in russia before 
the russian socialist democratic labour party was formed in 
it struggled to give peasants their rights over land that belonged to nobles
as land was divided among peasants periodically it was felt that peasants and not workers would be the main source of the revolution
but lenin did not agree with this as he felt that peasants were not one social group
the party was divided into bolsheviks and mensheviks
the  revolution russia was an autocracy
the tzar was not subject to the parliament
liberals wanted to end this state of affairs
they worked towards demanding a constitution during the revolution of 
bloody sunday prices of essential goods rose so quickly by  that the real wages declined by %
during this time four members of the putilov iron works were dismissed
the action was called for
over  workers in st
petersburg went on strike demanding a reduction in working hours and an increase in wages
this procession was attacked by the police and cossacks
over  workers were killed
strikes took place as a reaction
people demanded a constituent assembly
the tzar dismissed the first duma within  days and announced the election of a second duma
the first world war and the russian empire in  the russian army was the largest army in the world
the war was initially very popular but later the support grew thin
russian armies lost badly in germany and austria
there were  million casualties and  million refugees in russia
the war also affected the industry
there was a shortage of labour railway lines were shut down and small workshops were closed down
there was a shortage of grain agricultural production slumped and thus there were crises in the food supply
the february revolution in petrograd events  in the winter of  petrograd was grim
there was a food shortage in the workers’ quarters
  february a lockout took place at a factory
workers of  other factories joined in sympathy
women also led and participated in the strikes
this came to be called the international women’s day
 the government imposed curfew as the quarters of the fashionable area and official buildings were surrounded by workers
 on the th and th the government called out the cavalry and police to keep an eye on them

people raised slogans and were out in the streets
 cavalry was called out again but they refused to fire on the demonstrators
 an officer was shot at the barracks of a regiment and other regiments mutinied voting to join the striking workers
they gathered in the evening to form a soviet or council
this was the petrograd soviet
 on th a delegation went to meet the tzar
the military commanders advised him to abdicate
 the tzar abdicated on nd march
 a provincial government was formed by the soviet and duma leaders to run the country
 the people involved were the parliamentarians workers women workers soldiers and military commanders
 soviets like the petrograd soviet were set up everywhere
 in individual areas factory committees were formed which began questioning the way industrialists ran their factories
soldiers’ committees were formed in the army
 the provisional government saw its power declining and bolshevik influence grow
it decided to take stern measures against the spreading discontent
 it resisted attempts by workers to run factories and arrested leaders
 peasants and the socialist revolutionary leaders pressed for a redistribution of land
land committees were formed and the peasants seized land between july and september 
october revolution  th october  – lenin persuaded the petrograd soviet and the bolshevik party to agree to a socialist seizure of power
 the uprising began on th october
prime minister kerenskii left the city to summon troops

this led to economic growth
 an extended schooling system developed
 the collectivization of farms started
the civil war – when the bolsheviks ordered land redistribution the russian army began to break up
non-bolshevik socialists liberals and supporters of autocracy condemned the bolshevik uprising
they were supported by french american british and japanese troops
all of them fought a war with the bolsheviks
making a socialist society – the bolsheviks kept industries and banks nationalized during the civil war
a process of centralized planning was introduced
rapid construction and industrialization started
an extended schooling system developed
stalin and collective farming – stalin believed that rich peasants and traders stocked supplies to create a shortage of grains
hence collectivization was the need of the hour
this system would also help to modernize farms
those farmers who resisted collectivization were punished deported or exiled
global influence by the s it was recognized in the country and outside that everything was not in keeping with the ideals of the russian revolution
though its industries and agriculture had developed and or were being fed the essential freedom to its citizens was being denied
however it was recognized that social ideals still enjoyed respect among the russians
but in each country the ideas of socialism were rethought in a variety of different ways
 formation of the weimer republic  the rise of hitler’s power  the flow of nazi around the world  the racial ideology of hitler and how it affected other countries  how the years of depression affected the german economy
birth of the weimer republic germany fought the first world war - along with the austrian empire and against the allies england france and russia
germany initially made gains by occupying france and belgium
however the allies won defeating germany and the central powers in 
a national assembly met at weimer and established a democratic constitution with a federal structure
the republic however was not received well by its own people largely because of the terms it was forced to accept after germany’s defeat at the end of the first world war
many germans held the new weimer republic responsible for not only the defeat in the war but the disgrace at versailles
the effects of the war – the war had a devastating impact on the entire continent both psychologically and financially
from being a creditor europe became a debtor
the supporters of the weimer republic were criticized and became easy targets of attack in the conservative nationalist circles
soldiers came to be placed above civilians
aggressive war propaganda and national honour became important
political radicalism and economic crisis – the birth of the weimer republic coincided with the uprising of the spartacist league on the pattern of the bolshevik revolution in russia
the spartacists founded the communist party of germany
political radicalization was heightened by the economic crisis of 
germany retaliated with printing paper currency recklessly
the value of the german mark collapsed
the years of depression - saw some stability yet it was built on sand
in  with the introduction of the dawes plan by the americans germany came out from the financial instability
germany was totally dependent on short-term loans largely from the usa
this support was withdrawn with the crash in  of the wall street exchange
the german economy was hit badly
the middle class and working population were filled with the fear of proletarianization
the weimer republic had some inherent defects 
article  which gave the president the powers to impose emergency suspend civil rights and rule by decree
hitler’s rise to power hitler was born in austria in 
he earned many medals for bravery in the first world war
the german defeat horrified him
the treaty of versailles made him furious
he joined the german workers party and renamed it national socialist german workers’ party
this later came to be known as the nazi party
nazism became a mass movement only during the great depression
the nazi propaganda stirred hopes of a better future
hitler was a powerful and effective speaker
he promised the people a strong nation where all would get employment
the destruction of democracy hitler achieved the highest position in the cabinet of ministries on  january 
hitler then set out to dismantle the structures of democratic rule
the fire decree of  february  suspended civic rights like freedom of speech press and assembly
the communists were hurriedly packed off to newly established concentration camps
all political parties were banned
special surveillance and security forces were created to control the people and rule with impunity
this was to be done through a state-created economic programme
hitler pulled out of the league of nations in  reoccupied the rhineland in  and integrated austria and germany in  under the slogan one people one empire one leader
he then took sudetenland from czechoslovakia
hitler had the unspoken support of england
he did not stop here
he chose war as a way out of the economic crisis
resources were to be accumulated through the expansion of territory
in september ′ germany invaded poland
this started a war with france and england
the usa resisted involvement in the war
but when japan extended its support to hitler and bombarded pearl harbour the usa entered the war
the war ended in  with hitler’s defeat and the us bombing of hiroshima and nagasaki in japan
the nazi world wide according to nazi ideology there was no equality between people but only racial hierarchy
the nazis quickly began to implement their dream of creating an exclusive racial community of pure germans by physically eliminating all those who were considered undesirable
they wanted a society of pure and healthy nordic aryans
jews gypsies blacks russian poles even certain germans and abnormals were considered undesirable
the other aspect of hitler’s ideology related to the geopolitical concept of lebensraum or living space
jews were the worst sufferers in nazi germany
hitler believed in pseudoscientific theories of a race which said that conversion was no solution to the jewish problem
it had to be solved through their total elimination
from - – the nazis terrorized pauperized and segregated the jews compelling them to leave the country
the next phase - aimed at concentrating them in certain areas and then killing them in gas chambers in poland
poles were forced to leave their homes and properties behind to be occupied by the ethnic germans brought in from occupied europe
youth in nazi germany hitler felt that a strong nazi society could be established by teaching nazi ideology to children
all schools were given german teachers
children were divided into two groups- desirable and undesirable
textbooks were rewritten functions of sports in schools was to nurture the spirit of violence and aggression
ten-year-olds had to enter jungvolk
at  all boys joined ‘hitler youth’ they joined the labour service at 
the nazi cult of motherhood – women were told to be good mothers and rear pure-blooded aryan children
they were encouraged to produce many children
the art of propaganda – the nazi regime used language and media with care and often to great effect
they used films pictures radio posters etc
 to spread hatred for jews
crimes against humanity – people saw the world through nazi eyes and spoke the nazi language
at times even the jews began to believe in the nazi stereotypes about them
knowledge about the holocaust – it was only after the war ended that people came to know about what had happened
the jews wanted the world to know about the atrocities and sufferings they had endured during the nazi killing operations
they just wanted to live even if it was for a few hours to tell the world about the holocaust
therefore students should have a deep understanding of these concepts
 changes in forest societies under colonialism  location of bastar people  bastar rebellion  forest rebellion in java  world wars and deforestation
relationship between forest and livelihoods forests give us a mixture of things to satisfy our different needs — fuel fodder leaves trees suitable for building ships or railways trees that can provide hardwood
forest products like roots fruits tubers herbs are used for medicinal purposes wood for agricultural implements like yokes ploughs etc
forests provide shelter to animals and birds
they also add moisture to the atmosphere
rainfall is trapped in forest lands
foresters and villagers had very different ideas of what a good forest should look like
the forest department wanted trees which were suitable for building ships or railways
they needed trees that could provide hardwood and were tall and straight
so particular species like teak and sal were promoted and others were cut
the new forest laws meant severe hardship for villagers across the country
after the act forest act all their everyday practices cutting wood for their houses grazing their cattle collecting fruits and roots hunting and fishing became illegal
people were now forced to steal wood from the forests and if they were caught they were at the mercy of the forest guards who would take bribes from them
women who collected fuelwood were especially worried
it was also common for police constables and forest guards to harass people by demanding free food from them
under colonial rule it became very systematic and extensive
why deforestation as the population increased over the centuries and the demand for food went up peasants extended the boundaries of cultivation by clearing forests
the british encouraged the production of commercial crops like jute sugar wheat and cotton for their industries as raw material
the british thought that forests were unproductive land as they yielded no revenue nor agricultural produce
cultivation was viewed as a sign of progress
oak forests in england were disappearing
there was no timber supply for the shipbuilding industry
forest resources of india were used to make ships for the royal navy
the spread of railways required two things land to be cleared to lay railway tracks wood as fuel for locomotives and for railway line sleepers
large areas of natural forests were cleared for tea coffee and rubber plantations
thus the land was given to planters at cheap rates
changes in forest societies under colonialism shifting cultivators forest management had a great impact on shifting cultivators
in shifting cultivation parts of the forest are cut and burnt in rotation
european foresters regarded this practice as harmful for the forests
they felt that such land could not be used for growing trees for railway timber and was dangerous while being burnt as it could start a forest fire
this type of cultivation also made difficult for the government to calculate taxes
nomadic and pastoralist communities nomadic and pastoralist communities were also affected by changes in forest management
their traditional customary grazing rights were taken away and their entry into the forests was restricted
passes were issued to them which had details of their entry and exit into and out of the forests
the days and hours they could spend in the forest were also restricted
this was in contrast to the earlier system that allowed them unrestricted entry into forests
pastoralists had to lessen the number of cattle in their herds which reduced their income
now they were deprived of this additional income
some pastoralists even had to change their lifestyle leave pastoralism and work in mines plantations factories
some were branded as the ‘criminal tribes’
they made huge profits and became richer
the entire timber and forest trade passed on to them
they became powerful and began to cut down trees indiscriminately
plantation owners plantation owners found that more and more forest land could be cleared for plantations
the british had made it very clear that their system of forestry would be scientific forestry i
plantation owners began to reap profits as the british government gave large areas of forest land to european planters
kingsbritish officials engaged in shikar the kingsbritish officials engaged in shikar found that now the villagers were prohibited from entering the forests
they had the forest and wild animals to themselves
hunting animals became a big sport for them
thus hunting increased to such an extent that various species became almost extinct
important dates  approximately one-sixth of india’s landmass was under cultivation
the population of java was 
% of the world’s total area was cleared for industrial uses cultivation pastures and fuel wood
 kalanga uprising which was suppressed
 the spread of indian railways
 the indian forest service was set up
 the indian forest act was formulated
 the indian forest act was amended and divided forests into reserved protected and village forests
 surontiko samin started a movement against the state ownership of forests
 rebellion in the kingdom of bastar
- india’s cultivated area rose by 
 the length of railway tracks laid by now was over  km
location of bastar and believe of the people of bastar bastar is located in the southernmost part of chhattisgarh and borders andhra pradesh odisha and maharashtra
the central part of bastar is on a plateau
a number of different communities live in bastar such as maria and muria gonds dhurwas bhatras and halbas
they speak different languages but share common customs and beliefs
the people of bastar believed that each village was given its land by the earth and in return they had to look after the earth by making some offerings at each agricultural festival
they show respect to the spirits of the river the forest and the mountain
since each village knows where its boundaries lie the local people look after all the natural resources within that boundary
if people from a village want to take some wood from the forests of another village they pay a small fee called devsari land or man in exchange
some villages also protect their forests by engaging watchmen and each household contributes some grain to pay them
every year there is one big hunt where the headmen of villages meet and discuss issues of concern including forests
causes for bastar rebellion when the colonial government proposed to reserve two-thirds of the forest in  and stop shifting cultivation hunting and collection of forest produce the people of bastar were very worried
some villages were allowed to stay on in the reserved forests on the condition that they worked free for the forest department in cutting and transporting trees and protecting the forest from fire
so these came to be known as forest villages
people of other villages were displaced without any notice or compensation
villagers had been suffering from increased land rents and frequent demands for free labour and goods by colonial officials
then the terrible famines came in - and again in -
results of the bastar rebellion in a major victory for the rebels work on the reservation was temporarily suspended
causes for forest rebellion in java the dutch wanted timber from java to build ships
they banned the practice of shifting cultivation
the dutch enacted forest laws in java restricting villagers’ access to forests
now wood could only be cut for specified purposes like making riverboats or constructing houses and only from specific forests under close supervision
villagers were punished for grazing their cattle in young stands transporting wood without a permit or traveling on forest roads with horse carts or cattle
as in india the need to manage forests for shipbuilding and railways led to the introduction of a forest service by the dutch in java
the dutch first imposed rents on land being cultivated in the forest and then exempted some villages from these rents if they worked collectively to provide free labour and buffaloes for cutting and transporting timber
this was known as the blandongdiensten system
forest rebellion in java or saminist movement in java in the s surontiko samin a teak forest villager began questioning state ownership of the forest
he argued that the state had not created the wind water earth and wood so it could not own it
soon a widespread movement developed
by  families were following his ideas
some of the sam insists protested by lying down on their land when the dutch came to survey it while others refused to pay taxes or fines or perform labour
world wars and deforestation the first world war and the second world war had a major impact on forests
in india working plans were abandoned at this time and the forest department cut trees freely to meet british war needs
in java just before the japanese occupied the region the dutch followed a ‘scorched earth’ policy destroying sawmills and burning huge piles of giant teak logs so that they would not fall into japanese hands
after the war it was difficult for the indonesian forest service to get this land back
as in india people’s need for agricultural land had brought them into conflict with the forest department’s desire to control the land and exclude people from it
pastoralism is a way of keeping animals such as cattle sheep that involves moving from one place to another to find water and food
nomads are people who do not live in one place but move from one area to another to earn their living
movement of pastoral nomads in mountains mainly pastoral communities are found in mountainous regions
gujjar bakarwals gujjar bakarwals of jammu and kashmir are great herders of goat and sheep
many of them migrated here in the th century in search of pastures for their cattle and settled here
in winter when the mountains were covered with snow they lived with their herds in the low hills of siwalik range
here the dry scrub forests provided pastures for their herds
they crossed the pir panjal passes and entered kashmir valley
in summer when the snow melted in the mountains and mountainsides were left lush green they moved onto high levels
the variety of sprouted grass provided rich nutritious forage for their animals
by the end of september they used to start moving again for their downward journey back to their winter base
several households came together for this journey forming a kafila
mandaps of ringal the gujjar cattle herders live in the mandaps made of ringal—a hill bamboo—and grass from the bugyal
a mandap was also a workplace
here the gujjar used to make ghee which they ‘ took down for sale
in recent years they have begun to transport the milk directly in buses and trucks
these mandaps are at about  to  feet as buffaloes cannot climb any higher
gaddi shepherds gaddi shepherd is a pastoral community of himachal pradesh
they had a similar cycle of seasonal movements like gujjar bakarwals of jammu and kashmir
by april they moved north and spent the summer in lahul and spiti
further to the east in garhwal f and kumaun the gujjar cattle herders came down to the dry forests of the bhabhar in the winter and went up to the high meadows-the bugyals in summer
many of the gujjar cattle herders were originally from jammu and kashmir and came to the uphills in the th century in search of good pastures
when the snow melted on the high mountains they moved onto higher mountain meadows dhars
by september they began their return movement
on the way they stopped once again in the villages of lahul and spiti reaping their summer harvest and sowing their winter crop
on the way down they stop for a while to have their sheep sheared
the sheep are bathed and cleaned before the wool is cut valley near palampur in himachal pradesh is one of the areas where shearing of wool is being done
then they further descend to their winter base the siwalik hills
bhotiyas sherpas and kinnauris many pastoralists of the himalayas like the bhotiyas sherpas and kinnauris also followed cyclic movement between summers and winters in search of pastures
they all had to adjust to seasonal changes and make proper use of available pastures
when the pasture was exhausted or unusable in one place they moved their herds and flock to new areas
this continuous movement of the pastoralists allowed the pastures to recover
on the plateaus plains and deserts the pastoral communities are also found in the plateaus plains and deserts of india
dhangars dhangars were an important pastoral community of maharashtra
in the early th century their population was more than  lakhs
they were mainly shepherds blanket weavers and buffalo herders
dhangars stayed in the central plateau of maharashtra during the monsoon
in the monsoon this track became a vast grazing ground for their flocks
by october the dhangars harvested the bajra and started to move towards west
konkan which had high rainfall and rich soil
here they were welcomed by the konkani peasants
dhangar flocks manured the fields and fed on the stubble
the konkani peasants also gave supplies of rice which the shepherds took back to the plateau where grain was scarce
with the onset of monsoon they returned to their settlements on the dry plateau as sheep could not tolerate the wet monsoon conditions
the gollas kurumas and kurubas the gollas kurumas and kurubas are the important pastoral communities of the dry central plateau of karnataka and andhra pradesh
the kurumas and kurubas reared sheep and goats and sold woven blankets
they lived near the forests cultivated small patches of land engaged in a variety of small trades and took care of their herds
the movement of these pastoralists depended on monsoon and dry season
in the dry season they moved to the coastal tracts and left when the rains came
only buffaloes liked the swampy wet conditions of the coastal areas during the monsoon months
other herds had to be shifted to the dry plateau at that time
movement of pastoral nomads on the plateaus plains and deserts bhabhar a dry forested area below the foothills of garhwal and kumaun
bugyals bugyals are vast natural pastures on the high mountains above  feet
they are under snow in the winter and come to life after april
at this time the entire mountainside is covered with a variety of grasses roots and herbs
by monsoon these pastures are thick with vegetation and carpeted with wild flowers
kharif the autumn crop usually harvested between september and october
rabi the spring crop usually harvested after march
stubble lower ends of grain stalks left in the ground after harvesting
banjara tribes they were an important group of graziers which were found in the villages of uttar pradesh punjab rajasthan madhya pradesh and maharashtra
in search of good pasture land for their cattle they moved over long distances
they sold their plough cattle and other goods to villagers in exchange of grain and fodder
ratios they lived in the deserts of rajasthan
before  they used to migrate to sindh and grazed their animals on the banks of the indus
now they started migrating to haryana where sheep can graze on agricultural fields after the harvest
the rainfall in the region was less and uncertain
so they combined cultivation with pastoralism
during the monsoon the raikas of barmer jaisalmer jodhpur and bikaner stayed in their home villages where pasture was available
by october when those grazing grounds were exhausted they moved out in search of new pastures
they returned in their home villages during the next monsoon
maru raikas one group of raikas were known as maru raikas who reside in the thar desert near jaisalmer rajasthan
their settlement is called a dhandi
they herded camels and another group reared sheep and goat
maru raikas know the history of their community from a genealogist
the genealogist is the one who recounts the history of tribes
such oral traditions give pastoral groups their own sense of identity
these oral traditions can tell us about how a group looks at its own past
camel fairs the camel fairs are held at different places of rajasthan such as pushkar balotra etc
camel herders come to the fair to sell and buy camels
the maru raikas also display their expertise in training their camels
horses from gujarat are also brought for sale at this fair
factors that contributed to the movement of pastoralists the life of pastoral groups is not easy
it was sustained by careful consideration of a host of factors
they had to judge how long the herds could stay in one area and know where they could find water and pasture
they needed to calculate the timing of their movements and ensure that they could move through different territories
customary rights rights that are used by people by custom and tradition
they had to set up a relationship with farmers on the way so that the herds could graze in harvested fields and manure the soil
they combined a range of different activities viz
 cultivation trade and herding to make their living
colonial rule and pastoral life the colonial government made different laws from time to time which severely affected the lives of the pastoralists
their grazing grounds shrank their movements were regulated they had to pay high revenue their agricultural stock declined and their trades and crafts were also affected adversely
these lands did not produce revenue or agricultural products
from the mid-th century wasteland rules were enacted in various parts of our country
wasteland rules and forest acts the government granted selected individuals various concessions and encouraged to settle them in these areas
even some of them were made as headmen of villages
in most areas the lands taken over were actually grazing tracts used regularly by pastoralists as their customary rights
they believed that grazing destroyed the saplings and young shoots of trees that germinated on the forest floor
the herds crushed the saplings and munched away shoots
these prevented new trees to grow
the forest acts made by the british government changed the lives of pastoralists
some forests which produced commercially valuable timber like deodar or sal were declared as ‘reserved’
in the reserved forests no pastoral activity was allowed and in the protected forests their activity was strictly restricted
in the protected forests they needed a permit for entry
the permit specified the timing of their entry and departure
if they overstayed there they were liable to fines
criminal tribes act british officials were very suspicious of nomadic people
they wanted to rule over a settled population which could be easily identified and controlled
in  the british government in india passed the criminal tribes act
by this act many communities of craftsmen traders and pastoralists were classified as criminal tribes
they were stated to be criminal by nature and birth
as a result of this act these communities were expected to live only in notified village settlements and they were not allowed to move without a permit
the village police also kept a strict watch on them
the imposition of grazing tax in the mid—th century grazing tax was introduced by the british government in most pastoral lands of india
in order to increase income the government imposed tax even on animals
the tax per head of cattle went up rapidly and the system of the collection was made increasingly efficient
these contractors tried to extract high tax so that they could earn the profit
by the s the government began collecting taxes directly from the pastoralists
each of them was given a pass
the pastoralists had to pay tax on every animal they grazed in the pastures
to enter a grazing tract the pastoralist had to show the pass and pay the tax
report by the royal commission on agriculture the royal commission on agriculture in  reported that the extent of the area available for grazing has gone down tremendously with the extension of the area under cultivation because of increasing population an extension of irrigation facilities acquiring the pastures for government purposes e
defence industries and agricultural experimental farms
now breeders find it difficult to raise large herds
thus their earnings have gone down
the quality of their livestock has deteriorated dietary standards have fallen and indebtedness has increased
effects of colonial changes on the lives of pastoralists wasteland rules forest acts criminal tribes act and the imposition of grazing tax affected the lives of pastoralists badly
the effects were  these measures led to the serious shortage of pastures as grazing lands were turned into cultivable land
 the shepherds and cattle herds could no longer freely graze their cattle in the forests
 nomadic people had to move frequently from one place to another in search of pastures
 the animal stock declined as underfed cattle died in large numbers during scarcities and famines
ways by which pastoralists cope with the changes pastoralists coped up with the changes in a variety of ways  some reduced the number of cattle in their herds since there was not enough pasture to feed large numbers
 some discovered new pastures when a movement to old grazing grounds became difficult
 over the years some richer pastoralists began buying land and settling down giving up their nomadic life
 many poor pastoralists borrowed money from moneylenders to survive
 some of them became labourers working on fields or in small towns
 in spite of such difficulties pastoralist communities still exist and are considered the most important form of life ecologically
even now over  million africans depend on some forms of pastoral activities for their livelihood
the different pastoral communities of africa are bedouins berbers maasai somali boran and turkana
most of them lived in semi-arid grasslands where rainfed agriculture is difficult
they raise cattle camels goats sheep and donkeys
they sell milk meat animal skin and wool
some of them earn through trade and transport
others combine pastoral activity with agriculture field and still others do a variety of odd jobs
the life of maasai community the maasai are nomadic and pastoral people who depend on milk and meat for subsistence
the title maasai derives from the word ‘maa’
before colonial rules maasailand stretched over a vast area from north kenya to the steppes of northern tanzania
in the late th century european imperial powers divided the region into different colonies
after colonial rule best grazing lands of maasai community were gradually taken over for white settlement and the maasai were pushed into a small area in southern kenya and northern tanzania
by changing conditions the maasai were forced to agriculture
they started growing crops such as maize rice potatoes cabbage
maasai believed that tilling the land for crop farming is a crime against nature
once you cultivate the land it is no longer suitable for grazing
effects of colonial ryle on naassi community maasais lost their grazing lands from the late  th century the british colonial government in east africa also encouraged local peasant communities to expand cultivation
as cultivation expanded pasturelands were turned into cultivated fields
the maasai community lost about % of their land and were confined to an arid zone with uncertain rainfall and poor pastures
by the end of colonial rule the situation became the opposite
in  maasailand was cut into half with an international boundary between british kenya and german tanganyika
they lost their grassing lands in the following ways large areas of grazing land were turned into game reserves like the maasai mara and samburu national park in kenya and serengeti park in tanzania
the serengeti national park has created over  km of maasai grazing land
without grass livestock cattle goats and sheep were malnourished which meant less food available for families and their children
the kilimanjaro water project cuts through the communities of the area near amboseli national park
but the villagers are barred from using the water for irrigation or for livestock
the loss of the finest grazing lands and water resources created a serious problem for the pastoralists
feeding the cattle became a persistent problem due to the unavailability of enough grazing lands
effect of closed borders on pastoralists pastoral groups were forced to live within the confines of special reserves
the boundaries of these reserves became the limits within which they could now move
they were not allowed to move out with their stock without special permits
they were not even allowed to enter the markets in white areas
they were prohibited from participating in any form of trade
the new territorial boundaries and restrictions imposed on them suddenly changed the lives of pastoralists
this adversely affected both their pastoral and trading activities
earlier pastoralists not only looked after animal herds but traded in various products
the restrictions under colonial rule did not entirely stop their trading activities but they were now subject to various restrictions
effect of dried pastures on maasais the maasais were forced to live in semi-arid tracts prone to frequent drought
since they could not shift their cattle to places where pastures were available large numbers of maasai cattle died of starvation and disease in these years of drought
the elders formed the ruling group and met in periodic councils to decide on the affairs of the community and settle disputes
the warriors consisted of young people mainly responsible for the protection of the tribe
the warrior class proved their manliness by raiding the cattle of other pastoral groups and participating in wars
the british imposed various restrictions on raiding and warfare
thus the traditional authority of both elders and warriors was negatively affected
the chiefs appointed by the colonial government accumulated wealth over time
they had regular income with which they could buy animals goods and lands
they lent money to poor neighbours who needed it to pay taxes
they started to live in towns and involved in trades
their family stayed back in villages to look after lands and animals
these rich chiefs managed to survive devastations due to war and drought
the poor pastoralists did not have the resources to tide over bad times and thus they were compelled to do odd jobs like charcoal burners workers in road and building construction etc
rituals to become maasai warrior even today maasai young men go through an elaborate ritual before they become warriors although actually it is no longer common
they must travel throughout the section’s region for about  months ending with an event where they run to the homestead and enter with an attitude of a raider
during the ceremony boys dress in loose clothing and dance non-stop throughout the day
this ceremony is the transition into a new age
girls are not required to go through such a ritual
kaokoland herders of namibia in namibia in south-west africa the kaokoland herders traditionally moved between kaokoland and nearby ovamboland and they sold skin meat and other trade products in neighbouring markets
all this was stopped with the new system of territorial boundaries that restricted movements between regions
in most places in colonial africa the police were given instructions to keep a watch on the movements of pastoralists and prevent them from entering white areas
new laws and new borders affect the patterns of their movement
they change the path of their annual movement reduce their cattle numbers press for rights to enter new areas
they exert political pressure on the government for relief subsidy and other forms of support and demand a right in the management of forests and water resources
they are not people who have no place in the modern world
environmentalists and economists have increasingly come to recognise that pastoral nomadism is a form of life that is perfectly suited to many hilly and dry regions of the world
pastoralism is a way of keeping animals and moving from one place to another to find water and food
gujjar bakarwals migrated in the th century to kashmir crossing pir panjal
they shifted their grazing lands from highlands in summer to lower hills of siwalik range in winter
they used to move to form kafila
gaddi shepherds of himachal pradesh like gujjar bakarwals used to come down to the dry forest of bhabhar in winter and went up to the high meadows of bugyals in summer
shearing of wool is being done at uhl valley near palampur in himachal pradesh
to adjust to seasonal changes and make proper use of available pastures bhotiyas sherpas and kinnauris also involved in cyclic movement between summer and winter
of central plateau maharashtra were mainly shepherds blanket weavers and buffalo herders
after harvesting bajra they move towards konkan to reap benefits of high rainfall and rich soil
gollas kurumas and kurubas are cattle herders of dry central plateau qf karnataka and andhra pradesh
cyclic movement of pastoralist communities in plateaus plains and desert was defined by alteration of monsoon and dry season
raikas of rajasthan had to combine cultivation with pastoralism when sindh became part of pakistan after 
maru raikas of jaisalmer lived in a settlement called dhandi and know about their community from a genealogist
camel fairs were held in pushkar balotra where maru raikas display their expertise in training camels
pastoralists had to set up a relationship with farmers and combined a range of different activities like cultivation trade and herding
colonial government considered that all grazing lands were unproductive
hence they categorised forest into the reserved forest no pastoral activity allowed and protected forest permit system prevailed
these laws affected the customary rights of the traditional pastoralist
criminal tribe act of  classified many communities of craftsmen traders and pastoralists as criminal tribes
british government introduced grazing tax which was auctioned out to contractors
the changes brought by laws of british government reduced the available area for pastureland
thus continuous grazing in the same piece of land degraded the quality of pasture
to adapt to the changing circumstances pastoralists reduced the number of cattle discovered new pasture
some even bought land and started settling down
pastoralism is still considered an ecologically most viable form of life
africa houses over half of the world’s pastoral population
pastoral communities like bedouins berbers maasai somali boran and tukana lived here
territorial boundaries and restrictions were imposed on pastrolists and required the social permit to move out of it
kaokoland herders of namibia were severely affected by these territorial boundaries
maasai society was divided into elders and warriors
elders were ruling community who settled disputes and decided on affairs of the community
the warriors were young people who raided cattle and participated in wars
but restrictions imposed’ by britishers affected the traditional authority of both elders and warriors
though the traditional difference between elders and warriors was disturbed it did not breakdown
with social change new distinction between wealthy and poor pastoralist developed
the relevance of maasai tribe can be realised from the fact that even today young men go through an elaborate ritual before they become warriors
the boys in the ceremony wear loose clothing and dance throughout the day
pastoral communities are greatly affected by the new laws and new borders of the countries
but they are not redundant communities rather recognised as the perfectly suitable communities for many hilly and dry regions by environmentalists and economists
the small cottages in england the wheat farmers of the usa and the opium producers of bengal india
the comparison between the histories of different places shows how these histories are different even though some processes are similar
the time of open fields and common land in england the agricultural system of england changed dramatically over the late th and the early th century
before this time in large parts of england the countryside was open
the lands were not enclosed or partitioned by the landlords
peasants cultivated on strips of land around the village they live in
at the beginning of each year people were allocated a number of strips to cultivate at the public meeting
these strips were located at different places and vary in quality
benefits of common land beyond enclosures lands lay the common land
due to this it was ensured that everybody gets a mix of good and bad land
everybody had access to the common land
on this land villagers grazed their cattle and collected fuelwood for fire
they also gathered berries and fruits for food
they fished in the rivers and ponds and hunted rabbits in common forests
for the poor the common land was essential for survival as it helped them to overcome bad times when crops failed
wool production and enclosures in the th century the price of wool went up in the world market
rich farmers wanted to expand wool production thus they began dividing and enclosing common lands to allow improved breeding of sheep
they prevented the poor from entering the enclosed lands
after the mid—th century the enclosure movement swept through the countryside to fulfill the increasing demand for food grains due to the industrialization
between  and   million acres of land was enclosed
the british parliament passed  acts legalizing these enclosures
enclosure the fencing of once common land to bring it into private ownership in england between th to the th century
common land a piece of land over which everyone had customary rights of collecting fruits firewood grazing and even fishing
in the old enclosures of the th century promoted sheep farming but  new enclosure of the late th century was for grain production
from the mid-th century the english population expanded four times
this meant an increased demand for foodgrains to feed the population
during this period britain was industrializing
thus more and more people began to live and work in urban areas
impact of migration and war on enclosure men from rural areas migrated to towns in search of jobs
to survive they had to buy foodgrains in the market
as the urban population grew the market for foodgrains expanded
when demand increased rapidly foodgrain prices rose
by the end of the th century france was at war with england
this broke trade and the import of foodgrains from europe
prices of foodgrains in england became very high encouraging landowners to enclose lands and enlarge the area under grain cultivation
landowners pressurized the parliament to pass the enclosure acts
the age of enclosures in earlier times rapid population growth was followed by a period of food shortages
foodgrain production in the past had not expanded as rapidly as the population
from the mid -th-century grain production grew as quickly as population
in  england was producing almost % of the food it consumed and the rest was imported
this increase in foodgrain production was made possible by innovations in agricultural technology and ‘ by bringing new lands under cultivation
landlords divided pasturelands and carved up open fields cut up forest commons took over marshes and turned larger areas into agricultural fields
innovation in agriculture in the late th century farmers continued to use simple innovation in agriculture
in the s farmers in many parts of england began growing turnip and clover instead of leaving the land fallow
they started practicing crop rotation to increase soil fertility
they soon discovered that planting these crops improved the soil and made it more fertile
turnip was moreover a good fodder crop relished by cattle
so farmers began cultivating turnips and clover regularly
these crops became part of the cropping system
now enclosures were seen as necessary to make long-term investments on land and plan crop rotations to improve the soil
effect of enclosures on the poor enclosures allowed only the landlords to make more profit
but for the poor life became hard
they could no longer collect firewood fruits and berries or graze their cattle or hunt small animals for meat
it was due to fences which made enclosed land the exclusive property of the landowner
enclosure happened on a big scale in the midlands and the countries around from which the poor were displaced
the poor found that their customary rights started gradually disappearing
from the midlands they moved to the southern counties of england in search of work
earlier the labourers lived with their landlords
they helped their masters and worked for them throughout the year
by  this practice was disappearing
landowners tried to increase their profit
thus they cut the amount they had to spend on their labourers
‘ the labourers were employed only during the harvest time
for a large part of the year the poor had no work
the introduction of threshing machines during the napoleonic wars prices of foodgrains were high and farmers expanded their production largely
the landlords began buying the new threshing machines to reduce dependence on labourers
a single machine could do the work of more than  labourers
the loss of livelihood forced the poor to oppose the introduction of threshing machine
the captain swing riots spread in the countryside at this time
the threshing machines had became a sign of bad times for the poor
after the napoleonic wars thousands of soldiers returned who needed alternative work to survive
at that time grain started flowing into england from europe and the prices declined so the landowners began reducing the area under grain cultivation
thus an agricultural depression set in
they tried to cut the wages and number of labourers they needed
protest and government actions in england during s farmers received threatening letters of not using threshing machines that remove workmen of their livelihood
some farmers found their barn and haystack reduced to ashes by fire at night
most of the letters were signed in the name of captain swing
it was a mythic name used in these letters
the government took severe actions on these riots
the suspects of the riots were arrested
conclusion on modern agriculture in england many changes was introduced with the coming of modern agriculture in england
the open fields disappeared and the customary rights of peasants were removed
the poor left their villages in large numbers while the richer farmers expanded grain production and made profits
the income of labourers became unstable their jobs insecure and their livelihood dependent on others
bread basket of the world modern agriculture developed in the usa and it became the breadbasket of the world
at the time when common fields were being enclosed in england at the end of the th century settled agriculture had not developed on any extensive scale in the usa
at that time forests covered over  million acres and grasslands prairies  million acres
most of the landscape was not under the control of white americans
till the s white american settlements were confined to a small narrow strip of coastal land in the east
at that time there were various native american groups
several of them were nomadic some were settled
still others were expert trappers through whom european traders had secured their supplies of beaver fur since the th century
by the early th century this landscape had transformed radically
white americans had moved westward and controlled up to the west coast by displacing local tribes and transformed the whole landscape into agricultural fields
the westward move of white americans and wheat cultivation many native americans lived by hunting gathering and fishing others cultivated corn beans tobacco and pumpkin
after the american war of independence  to  and the formation of the united states of america the white americans began to move westward
in  over  white americans had moved on to the appalachian plateau through the passes
they had the idea that wilderness of forests could be turned into cultivation fields
forest timber could be cut for export animals hunted for skin moutains mined for gold and minerals
for this the american indians had to be cleared from the land
displacement of local tribes and settlement to displace local tribes was not an easy task
many wars were waged in which indians were massacred and many of their villages burnt
they were forced to sign treaties give up  their lands and move westward
the settlers poured in as the indians retreated
the white americans settled on the appalachian plateau by the first decade of the th-century and then moved into the mississippi valley between  and 
wherever the white american settlers went they slashed and burnt the forests and cleared the land for cultivation
they ploughed the land and sowed corn and wheat
after the s the great plains across the river mississippi became a major wheat-producing area of america
timber for houses was not available in this area
settlers in the area began clearing the grasslands and made sod houses to live in
the wheat farmers of usa from the late th century there was a great expansion of wheat production in the usa
the urban population was  growing and the export market was becoming bigger
with i the increasing demand for grain prices also increased and encouraged the farmers to produce more
the spread of railways also made it easier for exporting the grain
by the early th century the demand became even higher
the demand of wheat further increased during the first  world war when russian supply of wheat was cut off
the us president wilson called upon the farmers to plant more wheat
he said ‘plant more wheat i
wheat will win the war’
in  about  million acres of land in the usa was i under wheat production
after  years the area had expanded to  million acres an increase of about %
in the usa a new class was emerged-the wheat barons who controlled as much as  to  acres of land individually
the coming of new technology the expansion of wheat production was made possible by  new technology
in the th century as the settlers moved into new habitats and new lands they modified their implements to meet their requirements
to break the sod and turn the soil a variety of new ploughs were devised
some of them were about  feet long
in the early th century farmers were breaking the ground with tractors and disk ploughs clearing vast stretches for wheat production
before the s the grain used to be harvested with a cradle or sickle
the new machines allowed big farmers to rapidly clear large tracts break up the soil by removing the grass and prepare the ground for cultivation
with power- driven machinery  men could plough effect seed and harvest  to  acres of wheat in a season
effect of new technology on the poor machines brought misery for the poor
many poor farmers bought machines by taking loans from the banks
they hoped the wheat prices would bring high profits and they would pay their debts back
but it did not happen due to the war
production expanded during the war and unsold stock piled up
wheat prices fell and the export market collapsed
the vast amount of wheat and corn turned into animal feed
this created great agrarian depression of the s
those poor farmers who borrowed money found it difficult to pay back their loan
many of them left their farms and looked for a job elsewhere
usa became dust bowl the expansion of wheat production in the usa created other problems
farmers slashed and burnt forests indiscriminately uprooted all vegetation which had deep roots in the earth
as trees and grasses were cut there was no rains year after year and the temperature increased
the tractors had broken the soil into dust
the whole region had become a dust bowl
in the s terrifying duststorm began to blow over the southern plains
the wind blew with great speed
black blizzards rolled in sometimes  to  feet high
it looked like monstrous waves of muddy water
through the s these duststorms came day after day and year after year
people were blinded and choked cattle were suffocated to death sand covered fields and coated the surfaces of the rivers till fishes died
dead bodies of birds and animals were all over the landscape
in the late th century the english east india company was buying tea and silk from china for sale in england
as tea became a popular english drink the tea trade became more and more important
in  about  million pounds of tea were being imported into england
by  the figure had jumped to over  million pounds
in fact the profits of the east india company came to depend on the tea trade
the problem of english hembants with chin england at this time produced nothing that could be easily sold in china
the confucian rulers of china the manchus were suspicious of all foreign merchants
the manchus were unwilling to allow the entry of foreign goods
in such a situation western merchants found difficulty in financing the tea trade
they could buy tea only by paying in silver coins or bullion
this meant an outflow of treasure from england a prospect that created widespread anxiety
it was believed that a loss of treasure would make the nation poor and deplete its wealth
merchants therefore looked for ways to stop this loss of silver
they searched for a commodity they could sell in china something they could persuade the chinese to buy opium was such a commodity
opium as a medium of exchange the portuguese had introduced opium into china in the early th century
opium was however known primarily for its medical properties and used in very small quantities for certain types of medicines
the chinese were aware of the dangers of opium addiction and the emperor had forbidden its production and sale except for medicinal purposes
but western merchants in the mid—th century began an illegal trade in opium
it was unloaded in a number of sea ports of south-eastern china and carried by local agents to the interiors
while the english cultivated a taste for chinese tea the chinese became addicted to opium
people of all classes took to the drug
as china became a country of opium addicts british trade in tea flourished
the returns from opium sale financed the tea purchases in china
as the market for opium expanded in china larger volumes of opium flowed out of bengal ports
before  no more than  chests of two maunds each were being exported from india
supplies had to be increased to feed this booming export trade
by  the government was exporting about  chests annually from bengal to china
unwilling cultivators made to produce opium indian farmers were not willing to grow opium in their lands for the following reasons  first opium had to be grown on the best land on fields that lay near villages and well manured
 second many cultivators owned no land so they had to pay rent and lease land from the landlords
 third the cultivation of opium is a long and difficult process
 finally the price the government paid to the cultivators for the opium they produced was very low
it was unprofitable for cultivators to grow opium at that price
unwilling cultivators were made to produce opium through a system of advances
in bengal and bihar there were a large number of poor peasants who found it difficult to survive
when the village headman mahato offered loans to produce opium they took it hoping to repay it later
the government opium agents gave the money to the headman who gave it as loan to the peasants
by taking the loan the peasants were forced to grow opium and hand over the product to the agents once the crop had been harvested
the prices given to the cultivators were very low
the british government was not ready to increase the price of opium
they wanted to produce it at a cheap rate and sell it at a high price
the difference between the buying and selling price was the government’s opium revenue
but the peasants began agitating for higher prices and refused to take advances
they even sold their crop to traveling traders pykars who offered higher prices
monopoly and conflict over opium trade by  the british government had established a monopoly to trade in opium
by the s the british found that opium production in their territories was rapidly declining but its production outside the british territories was increasing
in these areas local traders were offering much higher prices and were controlling the opium trade to china
the british government considered this trade illegal and instructed its agents posted in the princely states to seize all opium and destroy the crops
the conflict between the british government peasants and local traders continued as long as opium production lasted
conclusion all sections of rural people were not affected in the same way
some gained and others lost
the history of modernization was not only a glorious story of growth and development
it was also a story of displacements and poverty ecological crises and social rebellion colonization and repression
we need to look at these variations and strands to understand the diverse ways in which peasants and farmers confronted the modern world
the coming of modern agriculture in england created many problem for small farmers and labourers
in protest to the modern agriculture they started setting fire on haystack and barn destroying threshing machine
before advent of modern agriculture land were not enclosed and peasants cultivated on stripes of land allocated to them in public meeting
beyond enclosures land lied the common land where villagers grazed their cattle and collected fuel wood for fire
wool production gained importance in th century
so rich farmer enclosed the land preventing entry of poor farmers to expand wool production
though the enclosure movement was slow in the early of th century later on there was a fanatic effort to enclose land
the new enclosure was for grain production whereas old enclosures were for sheep farming
migration to urban areas due to industrialisation raised the demanct of foodgrain and thus its prices
foodgrains prices further increased when trade was disrupted due to england-french war
farmers also used certain innovative methods like growing turnip and clover practise of crop rotation etc
during the napoleonic wars prices of foodgrains were high and farmers expanded their production and bought threshing machine
after the napoleonic wars thousands of soilder returned who needed work there was grain inflow into england from europe food prices declined landlords reduced the area of cultivation which all led to the agricultural depression
development of modern agriculture in usa made it the bread basket of the world
with formation of the united states of america white americans moved westward and drove away american – indians native settlers
this displacements lead to may wars
in th century there was dramatic expansion in wheat production in usa
the export market grew bigger and rising prices encouraged farmers to produce more
new technology the ploughs to break the sod and turn the soil tractors diskplough and the reaper invented by cyrus mccormick helped improving wheat cultivation
machine brought misery for the poor many took loans to buy machines and found it difficult to pay back
after the first world war demand of wheat reduced stocks pilled up and all this lead to the great agrarian depression of s
indiscriminate cutting of trees practice of slashing and burning of forest resulted in drought and soaring temperature in usa
soil turned into dust and the whole region became a dust bowl
terrifying duststorm blew over the southern plains year after year
after the battle of plassey  to establish their rule in india the british wanted to impose regular system of land revenue thus expanded area of cultivation
indigo and opium were two major commercial crops in th century and later on sugarcane cotton jute wheat and several crops were also included to meet the growing demand in europe
the east india company was buying tea and silk from china for sale in england paying in silver coins
but is was drying out the treasury of england hence they started illegal trade in opium
the opium in china came from farmlands of bengal where poor farmers were lured to grow opium by giving them advance loans through village headman mahato
by  the british government had established a monopoly to trade in opium
but its production was also increasing outside british territory within the princely states in central india and rajasthan
the local traders controlled the trade
the british considered this trade illegal
the conflict between the british and local traders peasants continued as long as opium production lasted
the history of modernization of agriculture was not beneficial for all
some rural people gained and some lost
it shows the evolution of cricket as a game in england and discuss the wider culture of physical training and athleticism of the time
it will then move to the history of the adoption of cricket in our country
the story of cricket cricket was invented in england and became intimately linked to the culture of th century-victorian society
the game was expected to represent all that england valued fair play discipline and gentlemanliness
with the british cricket spread to the colonies
it was supposed to uphold the values of englishness also
the colonial masters assumed that only they could play the game as it ought to be played in its spirit
the game of cricket thus got linked up closely with the politics of colcnialism and nationalism
within the colonies of the british the game had a complex history
it was connected to the politics of caste and religion community and nation
the emergence of cricket as a national game was the result of many decades of historical development
cricket grew out of the many stick-and-ball games played in england  yeirs ago under a variety of different rules
the word ‘bat’ is an old english word thal simply means stick or club
by the th century cricket had envolved enough to be recognisable as a distinct game
till the middle of the th century bats were roughly the same shape ashockey sticks curving outwards at the bottom
there was a simple reason for this the ball was bowled underarm along the ground so the curve at the end of the bat j£ve the batsman the best chance of making contact
the historical development of cricket as a game in england the social and economic history of england in the th and th centuries shaped the game and gave it a unique nature
for instance a test match of cricket can go on for five days and still end in a draw
no other modern team sport takes even half as much time to complete
 yards but the size and shape of the ground is not specified
grounds can be oval like adelaide or nearly circular like chepauk in chennai
a six at the melbourne cricket ground needs to clear much more ground than a feroz shah kotla in delhi
both these strange aspects consist a historical reason
laws of cricket the first written laws of cricket were drawn up in 
these laws stated that ‘the principals shall choose the gentlemen from amongst present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes
the stumps must be  inches high and bail across them  inches
the ball must be between  to  ounces and the two sets of stumps should be  yards apart’
there was no limits on the shape or size of the bat
changes in cricket laws by marylebone cricket club
the world’s first cricket club was formed in hambledon in s and the marylebone cricket club mcc was founded in 
in  mcc published the first revision of the laws and became the guardian of cricket’s regulations
the mcc revision of the laws brought in a series of changes in the game that occurred in the second half of the tl century
during the s and s it became mmmon to pitch the ball through the air rather than rollit along the ground
it opened new possibilities for pace spin and swing for the bowlers
the weirht of the ball was limited between - ounces ind the width of the bat to  inches
in  the first leg-before law was published and three days had become the length of a major match
changes in cricket during th century many important changes occurred during the th century
they were  the rule about wide balls was applied  the exact circumference of the ball was specified  protective equipment like pads and gloves became available  boundaries were introduced
previously all shots had to be run  over-arm bowling became illegal
cricket as a reflection of past and present the game of cricket matured during the early phase of the industrial revolution in the late th century
this history has made cricket a game with characteristics of both past and present
even after boundaries were written into the laws of cricket their distance from the wicket was not specified
originally cricket matches did not have time limit
modern factory work meant that people were paid by the hour or the day or the week
that’s why games like football and hockey were strictly time-limited so that time should be limited to fit the routines of industrial city life
technological changes in cricket equipments the cricket has changed with changing time and it also remained true to its origins in rural england
cricket’s most important tools like bat ball stumps bails all are made of natural pre-industrial materials
the material of bat changed slightly over time
but cricket has refused to make its tools with man-made materials like plastic fibre glass metal etc
in the matter of protective equipment cricket has been influenced by technological change
the invention of vulcanised rubber led to introduction of pads in  and protective gloves soon afterward
also helmets made of metal and synthetic lightweight materials were introduced
the rich who could afford to play it for pleasure were called amateurs and the poor who played it for a living were called professionals
the wages of professionals were paid by patronage or subscription or gate money
gentlemen and the players the game was seasonal and it did not offer employment for the whole year
thus professionals worked as miners or in other forms of working class employment
the social superiority of amateurs was built into the customs of cricket
amateurs were called gentlemen while professionals were called players
they even entered the playground from different entrances
amateurs tended to be batsman leaving the energetic hardworking aspect of the game like fast bowling to the professionals
that is why the laws of the game always gave the benefit to the batsman
cricket is a batsman’s game because its rules were made to favour ‘gentlemen’
the social superiority of the amateur was also the reason that the captain of a cricket team was traditionally a batsman
captain of teams whether club teams or nationals sides were always amateurs
it was not till the s that the english team was led by a professional the yorkshire batsman len hutton
it means that britain’s military success was based on the values taught to school boys in its public schools
eton was the most famous of these school
the english boarding school was the institution that trained english boys for careers in the three great institution of imperial england i
the military civil service and the church
by the beginning of th century educationist like thomas arnold founder of the modern public school system saw team sport like cricket and rugby as not just outdoor game but as a way of teaching english boys the discipline the importance of hierarchy the skills the codes of conduct and the leadership qualities that helped them to build the british empire properly
cricket helped the english elite by glorifying the amateur ideal where cricket was played not for victory or profit but for its own sake in the spirit of game
english ruling class believed that they won the wars due to- the superior characters of its young men built in boarding schools playing gentlemanly games like cricket that tipped the balance
sports for girls till the end of the th century sports and vigorous exercise for girls were not a part of their education in britain
croquet which was a slow-pace elegant game considered suitable for women especially of the upper class
by the s schools began acquiring playgrounds and allowing girls to play some of the games which were earlier considered as male games
the spread of cricket some english team games like hockey and football became international games but cricket remained a colonial game
it was only played in the countries that were once had been part of british empire
in the colonies cricket was established as a popular sport either by white settlers or by local upper classes who wanted to copy their colonial masters
in colonies playing cricket became a sign of superior social and racial status
this remained dominated by white plantation owners and their servants
the blacks played informal cricket on beaches in back alleys and parks
cricket became hugely popular in the caribbean
success at cricket became a measure of racial equality and political progress
when the west indies wot its first test series against england in c it was celebrated as a national achievement
ironies of the victory the following points state ironies of this victory it was a way of demonstrating that west indians were the equals of white englishmen
the winning west indies team was captained by a white player
the first time a black player frank worrell led the west indies test team in 
the west indies cricket team represented not one nation but several dominions that later became independent countries
the first record of cricket being played in india is 
it was played as a recreational sport by english sailors in cambay
the first indian club the calcutta cricket club was established in 
through the th century cricket in india was only played by british military men and civil servants in all white clubs and gymkhanas
the first indian community to start playing the game was the small community of zoroastrians the parsis in bombay
the parsis came into close contact with the british because of their interest in trade and this was the first indian community to westernize
they founded the first indian cricket club the oriental cricket club in bombay in 
history of gymkhana cricket parsi clubs were funded and sponsored by parsi businessmen like the tatas and the wadias
there was a quarrel between the bombay gymkhana a whites-only club and parsi cricketers over the use of a public park
so the parsis built their own gymkhana to play cricket
the establishment of the parsi gymkhana became precedent for other indians who in turn established clubs based on the idea of religious community
by the s hindus and muslims were busy gathering funds and support for a hindu gymkhana and an islam gymkhana
the teams that played colonial india’s greatest and most famous tournaments represents religious communities
quadrangular and pentangular tournaments the first-class cricket tournament was called the quadrangular as it was played by four teams the europeans the parsis the hindus and the muslims
later the quadrangular became the pentangular when a fifth team viz the rest was added
the rest was comprised of all the communities left over
for example vijay hazare a christian played for the rest
by the late s and early s journalists cricketers and political leaders had begun to criticise the racial and communal foundations of the pentangular tournament
the distinguished editor of the bombay chronicle s a brelvi radio commentator a f s talyarkhan and india’s most respected political leader like mahatma gandhi were against the pentangular as a communally divisive competition
it was played at the time when nationalists were trying to unite india
a rival first-class tournament on regional lines the national cricket
championship later named the ranji trophy was established but was not able to replace pentangular tournament
it was present until independence but colonial tournament died with their rule
caste and cricket palwankar baloo was born in poona in 
he was the greatest indian slow bowler of his time
he played for the hindus in the quadrangular tournament
despite being their greatest player he was never made captain of the hindus because he was born as a dalit
his younger brother vithal was a batsman
he became captain of the hindus in  and led the team to a famous victory against the europeans
the moral that can be safely drawn from the hindus’ magnificent victory is that removal of untouchability would lead to swaraj which is the prophecy of mahatma gandhi
the modern transformation of the game tests and one-day internationals odis played between national teams dominate modern cricket
the players who become famous who live on in the memories of cricket’s public are those who have played for their country
the players are remembered by indian fans from the era of the pentangular and the quadrangular tournaments
ck nayudu is popularly remembered as an outstanding indian batsman
he became india’s first test captain and played for india in its first test match against england in 
the entry of indians to test cricket india entered the world of test cricket in 
the first test was played between england and australia when australia was still a white settler colony not even a self-governing dominion
similarly the small countries of the caribbean that together make up the west indies team were british colonies after the second world war
mahatma gandhi and colonial sport mahatma gandhi believed that sport was essential for creating a balance between the body and the mind
he often emphasised that games like cricket and hockey were imported into india by the colonial masters and were replacing our traditional games
games like cricket hockey football
and tennis were expensive games so these were meant for the privileged only
gandhiji suggested that these games showed a colonial mindset and were a less effective education than the simple exercise of those who worked on the land
decolonization and sport decolonization is the process through which different parts of european empires became independent nations
it began with the independence of india in  and continued for the next half of century
even after the disappearance of the british colonies the regulation of international cricket remained the business of the imperial cricket conference icc
in  the icc renamed the international cricket conference
but it was dominated by its foundation members england and australia which had the veto power
after  the privileged position of england and australia was taken away
the colonial flavour of world cricket during s and s can be seen from the fact that england australia and new zealand continued to play test cricket with south africa a racist state where a policy of racial segregation is practiced
test- playing nations like india pakistan and the west indies boycotted south africa
english cricket authorities canceled a tour by south africa only in  after the increasing political pressure to boycott the racist state
commerce media and cricket today the s was the decade in which cricket was transformed
it was notable for the exclusion of ‘racist’ south africa from international cricket
year  was a landmark year because the first one-day international was played between england and australia in melbourne
in  the first world cup was staged successfully
in  cricket was changed forever by a businessman
world series cricket kerry packer an australian television tycoon saw the money-making potential of cricket as a televised sport
he signed up fifty-one of the world’s leading cricketers against the wishes of the national cricket botrds and for about two years staged unofficial tests and one-day internationals under the name of world series cricket
it was described as packer’s circus
kerry packer made cricket more attractive to television audiences which changed the nature of the game
coloured dress protective helmets field restrictions cricket under lights became a standard part of the post-packer game
packer gave the lesson that cricket was a marketable game which could generate huge revenue
cricket boards became rich by selling television rights to television companies
television and expansion of cricket television channels made money by selling sports to television companies
the continuous television coverage made cricketers celebrities
the cricketers made larger sums of money by making commercials for wide range of products from types to colas on television
it expanded the audience for the game by beaming cricket into small towns and villages
the technology of satellite television and the worldwide reach of multi-national television companies created a global market for cricket
since india had the largest viewership and market for the game the game’s center of gravity shifted to south asia
this shift was symbolized by the shifting of the international cricket council icc headquarters from london to tax-free dubai
the center of gravity in cricket has shifted away from the old anglo-australian axis to subcontinental teams like india pakistan and sri lanka
conclusion one hundred and fifty years ago the parsis the first indian cricketers struggled for an open space to play cricket
today indian players are the best-paid most famous cricketers in the game
the factors behind this transformation are the replacement of the gentlemanly amateur by the paid professional the triumph of the one-day game in place of test cricket and the remarkable changes in global commerce and technology
in this way a colonial sport became the most popular game in our country
cricket was invented in england and it was assumed that the game ought to be played in its true spirit
hence it was linked up closely with politics of colonialism and nationalism caste religion and community
cricket had evolved as a different game by th century
ball was bowled underarm and till middle of the th century bats were of same shape as hockey sticks
cricket was shaped by the social and economic history of england in the th and  jth century
length of the pitch is specified as  yards but shape and size of the ground is not fixed
the laws of cricket were codified in 
stumps  inches high bail  inches ball  to  ounces but shape or size of bat not specified
marylebone cricket club mcc was founded in 
in  it published the first revision of the laws and became the guardian of cricket’s regulations
the past is reflected in the length of cricket match size of cricket grounds no time limit etc
the rich played for pleasure and were called amateurs and the poor played for living were called professionals
amateurs were called gentlemen while”professionals were called players
amateurs were batsman hence rules of cricket were in favor of batsman
educationist like thomas arnold saw sports like cricket rugby as not just outdoor game but as source of discipline skills code of conduct and leadership quality
girls were only allowed to play slow pace and elegant game until  after which they played games earlier considered as male games
the cricket remained a colonial game as playing cricket became a superior social and racial status
cricket became so popular in caribbean that success in cricket became a measure of racial equality and political progress
the calcutta cricket club was first indian club established in 
the oriental cricket club established by parsis in  was the first indian cricket club
the parsis team beat the bombay gymkhana in 
the first class cricket tournament was called quadrangular europeans parsismuslims and hindus later it became pentangular when a fifth team rest was added
the division of cricket tournament was condemned by respected leaders including mahatma gandhi for being communally divisive
modern cricket is dominated by test and one day internationals
india played first test rhatch against england in 
south africa was excluded from international cricket because of prevailing racialism
first international one day match was pldyed between england and australia in  at melbourne
kerry packer realised the money making
potential of cricket as a televised sport and made it more
popular and attractive with coloured dress protective helmets crickets under light etc the technology of satellite television created a global market for cricket
since india had the longest viewership the game center of gravity shifted to south asia
international cricket council icc headquarters shifted from london to dubai
colonial sport cricket became the most popular game in our country
all societies observe certain rules about wearing clothes
some of them are quite strict about the ways in which men women and children should dress or different social classes and groups should dress themselves
these rules were made to define the identity of people
they shape the notions of grace and beauty ideas of modesty and shame
as societies were transformed with time these rules also changed
history of clothing style the emergence of the modern world is marked by dramatic changes in clothing
before the age of democratic revolutions and the development of capitalist markets in th century europe most people dressed according to their regional codes
this was limited by the types of clothes and cost of materials that were available in that region
clothing styles were strictly regulated by class gender or status in the social hierarchy
after th century the colonisation of most of the world was done by europe
the growth of democratic ideals and industrial society changed the thinking and meaning of clothes for people
the people started using styles and materials from other countries
the western dress style for men was adopted worldwide
sumptuary laws and social hierarchy in medieval europe detailed laws regarding the dress code were sometimes imposed upon members of different sections of societies
from about  to the time of the french revolution in  the people of france were expected to strictly follow the sumptuary laws
the laws tried to control the behaviour of social inferiors preventing them from wearing certain clothes consuming certain foods and beverages arid hunting game in certain areas
in medieval france the materials to be used for clothing were legally prescribed
only royalty could wear expensive materials like ermine fur silk velvet and brocade
other classes were not allowed to clothe themselves with materials that were used by the aristocratic class
not all sumptuary laws were meant to emphasise social hierarchy some laws were passed to protect home production against imports
this law lasted for  years and was very useful in building up to english woollen industry
end of sumptuary laws the french revolution ended the dress distinctions between the rich and the poor as it completely removed the sumptuary laws
members of jacobin clubs called themselves as ‘sans-culottes without knee breeches
the fashionable ‘knee breeches’ were used by the aristocracy
both men and women began wearing clothing that was loose and comfortable
blue white and red became popular colours of france as they were a sign of the patriotic citizen
other political symbols too became a part of dress like the red cap of liberty long trousers and the revolutionary cockade which was pinned on to a hat
the simplicity of clothing was meant to express the idea of equality
clothing and notion of beauty the end of sumptuary laws did not mean that everyone in european societies could now dress in the same way
some social differences were still there as the poor could not dress or eat like the rich people
but laws no longer stopped people’s right to dress in the way they wished
different classes developed their own culture of dress according to their earnings
clothing styles in victorian england styles of clothing also emphasised differences between men and women
in victorian england dutiful and obedient women were considered ideal ones
they were expected to bear pain and sufferings
on the other hand a man symbolised strength depth seriousness and responsibility
norms or ideas of clothing reflected these ideals
from childhood girls were tightly laced up and dressed in stays
the effort was to restrict the growth to their bodies
when slightly older girls had to wear tight fitting corsets having a busk
tightly laced small-waisted women were admired as attractive elegant and graceful
thus clothing played a key role in creating humble and obedient victorian women
the reaction of women to the norms of clothing the ideals of womanhood were believed by many women
they got the ideals from society literature and educational institutions
from childhood they grew up to believe that having a small waist was a womanly duly
they had to wear the corset to be seen as attractive and to be womanly
but not everyone accepted these ideals
agitation in england over the th century ideas of women changed
by the s women in england began agitating for democratic rights
as the suffrage movement developed many women began agitating for democratic rights and campaigning for dress reform
women’s magazines described that tight dresses and corsets caused deformities and illness among young girls
such clothing restricted body growth and affected blood circulation
their muscles remain underdeveloped and spines got bent
doctors reported that many women were regularly complaining of acute weakness and fainted frequently
thus corset became necessary to hold up their weakened spine
agitation in america in america a similar movement developed amongst the white settlers on the east coast
traditional feminine clothes were criticised for various reasons
long skirts swept the grounds and collected dirt which caused illness
they were large in volume and difficult to handle
in the s mrs stanton of the national woman suffrage association and lucy stone of the american woman ‘ suffrage association campaigned for dress reform
thus women reformers did not immediately succeed in changing social values
but by the end of the th century changes started with the new times and new values came
people began accepting the ideas of reformers
new times many changes were made possible in britain due to the introduction of new materials and technologies
other changes came” about because of the two world wars and the new working conditions for women
introduction of new materials before the  th century most of the ordinary women in britain possessed very few clothes made of flax linen or wool which were difficult to clean
after  trade with india brought cheap beautiful easy to maintain indian chintzes within the reach of europeans
by the early th century artificial fibers appeared
they were clothes made of cheaper and easier to wash and maintain
of the late s heavy restrictive underclothes were no longer in use
clothes got lighter shorter and simpler
effect of the war on clothing major changes happened in women’s clothing due to the two world wars
many european ladies stopped wearing jewellery and luxurious clothes
social barriers were removed as upper class women mixed with other classes
all classes of women began to dress in similar ways
during the first world war - clothes of women got shorter due to practical necessity
by  over  lakh women in britain were employed in ammunition factories
they wore a working uniform
khaki overalls caps short skirts and trousers became the dresses of new professional women
use of bright colours in clothes was replaced by sober colours
thus clothes became plainer and simpler
effect of professionalism and games for convenience women took to cutting their hair short
by the th century a plain and
simple style came to reflect seriousness and professionalism
gymnastics and games entered the school curriculum for women
they had to wear clothes that did not affect movement
they needed clothes that were comfortable and convenient
clothing transformation in colonial india during the colonial period there were significant changes in male and female clothing in india
there was a consequence of the influence of western dress forms and missionary activity
it was also due to the effort by indians to fashion clothing styles that included an indigenous tradition and culture
cloth and clothing became very important symbols of national movement
in th century indians reacted to western style clothing in following three different ways many people began incorporating some elements of western style clothing in their dress
the wealthy parsis of western india were among the first to adopt western style clothing
baggy trousers and the phenta hat were added to long collarless coats with boots and a walking stick
at that time it was men rather than women who accepted the new dress styles first
there were others who were convinced ’that western culture would lead to a loss of traditional cultural identity
the use of the western style of clothes was taken as a sign of the world turning upside down
some men started wearing western clothes without giving up their indian clothes
in the late th century many bengali bureaucrats began stocking western-style clothes for working outside the home and used the more comfortable indian clothes at home
caste conflict and dress change though there were no formal sumptuary laws in india still it had its own strict social codes of food and dress
the caste system clearly defined what subordinate and dominant caste hindus should wear eat etc
 and these codes had the force of law
an example of caste conflict shanars of kerala the shanars were a community of toddy tappers who migrates to southern travancore to work under nair landlords
they were not allowed to use umbrellas shoes or gold ornaments
even men and women of shanar community were not allowed to cover their upper bodies before the upper caste
in s shanar women under the influence of christian missionaries began to wear tailored blouses like upper castes
but complaints were filed against them for dress change
specially when shanars also refused to give free service to the upper castes
hindu reformer like ayya vaikunder supported this dress reform
in  slavery was abolished in travancore and caste conflict emerged among upper castes and the shanars
finally by a proclamation of government shanar women were allowed to wear a jacket to cover their upper bodies but not like women of upper castes
british rule and dress codes in different cultures specific items of clothing often convey contrary meanings
this leads to misunderstanding and conflict
styles of clothing in british india changed through such conflicts
the turban in india was not just for protection from the heat but was a sign of respectability and could not be removed at will
this cultural difference sometimes created misunderstanding
the british were often offended if indians did not take off their turban when they met colonial officials
another such conflict related to the wearing of shoes
earlier british officials had to follow indian etiquette and remove their footwear in the courts of ruling kings or chiefs
some british officials also wore indian clothes
but in  europeans were forbidden from wearing indian clothes at official functions so that the cultural identity of the white masters was not destroyed
at the same time indians were expected to wear indian clothes to office and follow indian dress codes
controversy over taking off shoes in - governor general amherst ordered that indians should take off their shoes as a sign of respect when they appeared before him
but this order was not strictly followed
lord dalhousie made it mandatory that indians were made to take off their shoes when entering any government institution
only those who wore european clothes were exempted from this rule
in  manockjec cowasjee entee an assessor in the surat fouzdaree adawlut refused to take off his shoes in the court of sessions judge
he was restricted to enter into the courtroom and he sent a letter of protest to the governor of bombay
this incident led many controversies
indians urged that taking off shoes in sacred places and at homes was linked with following two reasons there was the problem of dirt
shoes collected the dirt on the road
this dirt could not be allowed into spaces that were clean particularly when people in indian homes sat on the ground
leather shoes and the dirt that stuck under it were seen as polluting
but public buildings like the courtrooms were different from home
it took many years for indians to enter courtroom wearing shoes
designing the national dress as nationalist feelings swept across india by the late th century indians began developing cultural symbols that would express the unity of the nation
artists looked for a national style of art poets wrote national songs a debate began over the design of national flag an experiment started in search of a national dress
this move was to define the cultural identity of the nation in a symbolic way
rabindranath tagore suggested that instead of combining indian and european dresses india’s national dress should combine elements of hindu and muslim dresses
so the chapkan a long buttoned coat was considered the most suitable dress for men
there were also attempts to develop a dress style that would draw on the tradition of different regions
pan-indian style of sari in the late s jnanadanandini devi wife of satyendranath tagore adopted the parsi style of wearing the sari
this was adopted by women of brahmo samaj and came to be known as brahmika sari
this style gained acceptance among maharashtrian and uttar pradesh brahmos as well as non-brahmos
however these attempts at devising a pan-indian style did not fully succeed
women of gujarat kodagu kerala and assam continue to wear different types of sari
the swadeshi movement the swedeshi movement in bengal in the first decade of th century was centrally linked to the politics of clothing
the british first came to trade in indian textiles that were in great demand all over the world
the industrial revolution in britain which mechanised spinning and weaving and greatly increased the demand for raw materials’ such as cotton and indigo changed india’s status in the world economy
political control of india helped the british in two ways
indian peasants were forced to grow crops like indigo and cheap british manufacture easily replaced coarser indian products
large number of indian weavers and spinners were left without work
important textile weaving centres like murshidabad machilipatnam and surat declined as demand fell
effect of partition of bengal on swadeshi movement in  lord curzon decided to partition bengal to control the growing opposition to british rule
the swadeshi movement developed in reaction to this measure
the use of khadi had became the patriotic symbol
women were urged to throw away their silk saries glass bangles and wear simple shell bangles
rough homespun was glorified by the patriotic poems and songs
the change of dress appealed largely to the upper class rather than the poor
actually it was impossible to compete with the cheap machine made products of britain by ‘swadeshi’ products
despite its limitations the experiment with swadeshi gave mahatma gandhi important ideas about using cloth as a symbolic weapon against british rule
mahatma gandhi’s experiments with clothing mahatma gandhi’s experiments with clothing summed up the changing attitude to dress in the indian sub-continent
it is stated in the points below  when he went to london to study law as a boy of  in  he cut off the tuft on his head and dressed in a western suit
on his return he continued to wear western suits topped with a turban
 as a lawyer in johannesburg south africa in the s he still wore western clothes
 in durban in  gandhiji first appeared in an itmgi and kurta with his head shaved as a sign of mourning to protest against the shooting of indian coal miners
 on his return to india in  gandhiji decided to dress like a kathiawadi peasant
 in  he adopted the short dhoti the form which he wore until his death
he adopted this dress of the poorest indian to identify himself as a common man
 khadi is a white and coarse dress material
it was a sign of purity simplicity and poverty for gandhiji
wearing khadi also became a symbol of nationalism and a rejection of western milptnade cloth
 gandhiji even wore the short dhoti without a shirt when he went to england for the round table conference in 
responses for gandhiji’s call for wearing khadi mahatma gandhi’s dream was to clothe the whole nation in khadi
he felt khadi would be a means of erasing difference between different religions classes etc
but these were not made of coarse cloth
 those who had been deprived by caste norms rules for centuries were attracted to western dress styles
therefore unlike mahatma’ gandhi other nationalists such as babasaheb ambedkar never gave up the western-style suit
 many dalits in the early s began to wear three-piece suits and shoes and socks on all public occasions as a political statement of self-respect
 a woman from maharashtra in  wrote to mahatma gandhi in response of his call
she said ‘a year ago i heard you speaking on the extreme necessity of everyone of us wearing khadi and thereupon decided to adopt it
but we are poor people my husband says khadi is costly
belonging as i do to maharashtra i wear a sari nine yards long …
and elders will not hear of a reduction to six yards’
 other women like sarojini naidu and kamala nehru wore coloured saris with designs instead of coarse white homespun
conclusion changes in styles of clothing are thus linked up with shifts m cultural tastes and notions or ideas of beauty
style also enhance due to the changes in the economy and changes in society due to social and political conflict
societies observe rules some of them are strict about the ways in which men women and children should dress
societies are transformed as times change and modifications in clothing reflect these changes
after the th century most of the world was colonised by europe
the growth of democratic ideals and industrial society changed the thinking and meaning of clothes for people
from - sumptuary laws tried to control the socially inferior classes from wearing certain clothes and consuming certain foods in france
french revolution ended the dress distinctions between the rich and the poor as it completely removed the sumptuary laws
law no longer barred people’s right to dress in the way they wished
different classes developed their own culture of dress according to their earnings
women were groomed to be docile dutiful submissive whereas man symbolised strength depth seriousness and responsibility
by the s women in england began agitating for democratic rights
as the suffrage movement developed many women started campaigning for dress reform
during the industrial revolution cotton clothes which were easy to wash and maintain become’more accessible to a wider section of people
thus clothes got lighter shorter and simpler
radical changes happened in women’s clothing due to the two world wars
european ladies stopped wearing jewellery and luxurious clothes
women started to wear uniform in their work place
thus clothes became plainer simpler and convenient
during the colonial period there were significant changes in male and female clothing in india
this change was consequence of the influence of western
dress forms and missionary activities
in th century western style clothing was accepted by dalits who were converted to christianity
it was men rather than women who accepted the new dress styles first
india had its own strict social codes of food and dress
the caste system clearly defined what subordinates and dominant caste hindus should wear eat etc
and these codes had the force of law
for example men and women of shanar community were not allowed to cover their upper bodies before the upper caste
in different cultures specific items of clothing often convey contrary meaning
this leads to misunderstanding and conflict styles of clothing in british india changed through such conflicts
the turban in india could not be removed at will as it was a sign of respectibility not just for protection from heat
but in western tradition the hat to be removed before social superiors as a sign of respect
experiment started over national songs national flag and national dress
rabindranath tagore suggested the chapkan as the most suitable dress for men and brahmika sari was adopted for women by jananadanandini devi
the swadeshi movement in bengal was linked to the politics of clothing
political control of india helped the british in two ways
indian peasants were forced to grow crops like indigo and cheap british manufacture easily replaced coarser indian products
in  partition of bengal started swedeshi movement
people started boycott of british goods of all kinds
the use of khadi had become the patriotic symbol
mahatma gandhi’s experiments with clothing summed up the changing attitude to dress in the indian sub-continent
wearing khadi become a symbol of nationalism
not all indian could wear khadi as it was coarse and costly rather than mill-made cloth
gandhi cap became a symbol of defiance and a part of the nationalist uniform
changes in style of clothing arise due to economic social and political changes in the society
some of the earliest people who lived there were skilled gatherers that is the people who gathered food
the sulaiman and kirthar hills to the north-west were some of the areas where women and men first began to grow crops such as wheat and barley about  years ago
people also began rearing animals like sheep goat and cattle and started living in villages
the places where rice was first grown were situated in the north vindhyas
men and women moved in search of livelihood as well as to escape from natural disasters like floods or droughts
sometimes men marched in armies conquering other’s lands
people have shared new ways of carving stones composing music and even cooking food over several hundreds of years
manuscripts were usually written on palm leaves or on the specially prepared bark of a tree known as the birch which grows in the himalayas
inscriptions are writings on relatively hard surfaces such as stone or metal
archaeologists study the remains of buildings made of stones and bricks paintings and sculpture
they also explore and excavate to find tools weapons pots pans ornaments and coins
archaeologists also look for the bones of animals birds and fishes in order to find out what people ate in the past
all dates before the birth of christ are counted backwards and usually have the letters bc or bce before christ added on
people have lived on the banks of the narmada for several thousand years
the earliest of them were skilled gatherers—people who gathered their food
near sulaiman and kirthar hills in present-day pakistan crops like wheat and barley were first grown  years ago
people also began rearing animals like sheep goat and cattle
rice was first grown in the north of the vindhyas
agriculture developed near the garo hills and near the vindhyas
cities also developed on the banks of the ganga
people travelled from one place to another and interacted with each other thus sharing ideas
this has enriched our culture
old books called manuscripts were usually written on palm leaf or the bark of the birch trip
they are helpful in revealing our past
archaeologists have also found inscriptions which are an engraved form of writing on hard surfaces such as stone or metal
they were used for various purposes
the people who study objects made and used in the past are called archaeologists
they explore and excavate to find old objects
they also look for bones of living beings to find what people ate
the people who study the past are historians
they look for information found from manuscripts and inscriptions which they call source
archaeologists people who study the objects made and used in the past are called archaeologists
excavation the process of digging under the surface of the earth in order to find old objects is called excavation
historians scholars who study the past are called historians
inscriptions these are writings on very hard surfaces like stone or metal
books that were written long ago by hand on palm leaf or barks of trees are called manuscripts
skilled gatherers the people who gathered their food
they have lived on the banks of the narmada for several hundred thousand years
tributaries smaller rivers that flow into a larger river are said to be its tributaries
it extends from  million years ago to about  years ago and is divided into lower middle and upper palaeolithic
mesolithic this period extends from  years ago to about  years ago
stone tools found during this period were generally tiny and were called microliths
neolithic this was the period that dates back to about  years ago and is therefore known as the new stone age
the earliest people they were hunter-gatherers a name derived from the way they collected food
they hunted animals collected berries and fruits and gathered nuts stalks and eggs
to hunt they needed to move constantly and to gather plant products they needed knowledge about the edibility of plants and change of seasons
archaeological evidence of early man how do we know about the early man this has been possible through an analysis of objects found which were probably used by the early man
for example tools made of stones bones and wood
uses of tools stone tools were used to cut meat and bones scrape bark from trees and hides animal skins as well as to chop fruit and roots
making stone tools two different techniques were used for making stone tools
choosing a place to live in dwellings chosen by the early man were located near sources of water such as rivers and lakes as well as where the good quality stone was available for their tools
painting-rock paintings paintings on a rock shelter
finding out about fire at kurnool caves in andhra pradesh evidence and traces of ash have been found suggesting use of fire
the fire might have been used as a source of light to cook meat and to scare away animals
a changing environment about  years ago there was a major change in the climate of the world
this change led to a shift to warm conditions leading to the development of grasslands at many places which helped people to start thinking about the herding and rearing animals
sometimes people lived habitat here for a longer span of time
bhimbetka this is a place in madhya pradesh where we find examples of habitation sites natural caves and rock shelters
people who lived in the subcontinent about  million years ago were hunter-gatherers
they hunted wild animals and gathered plant produce to get their food
they moved from place to place in search of more food water and resources
hunter-gatherers made and used various types of tools—tools of stone wood and bone
habitation refers to the place where people lived
stone tools were made using different techniques like a stone on stone using a stone to give required shape to another stone and pressure flaking
the fire was used by the early people
they used fire as a source of light to cook meat and to scare away animals
grasslands developed in many areas due to change in climate around  years ago
herding and rearing animals and fishing became common
several grain-bearing panes of grass like wheat barley rice grew naturally in different parts of the subcontinent
the people also began growing plants on their own
they show wild animals and are drawn with great accuracy and skill
a painting from a rock shelter
in hunsgi a number of early palaeolithic sites have been found
a large number of tools were also found most of which were made of limestone
factory-sites places where the stone was found and where people made tools are called factory-sites

many puranas such as the mahabharata and ramayana were written during this period
the puranas contain stories about gods and goddesses such as vishnu shiva durga parvati
the common features of the stupa are round tall big and small
at the centre of a stupa there is a small box known as a relic casket which contains bodily remains such as teeth bone and ashes
books on science during this period aryabhatta a mathematician and an astronomer wrote a book of science “aryabhatiyam”
he also developed a scientific explanation for eclipses
zero was invented in india during this period only
madurai madurai is one of the cities in tamil nadu known for its temples
in this city tamil sangam assembly emerged and contributed for the development of tamil literature and it was the first sangam assembly in the sequence of the three sangams
the great stupa it is located at sanchi in madhya pradesh
it dates back to the period of ashoka and is the best architectural evidence for buddhist history
these temples can be seen in mahabalipuram near chennai city in tamil nadu
the famous iron pillar at mehrauli in delhi is a remarkable example of the skill and art of the indian crafts people
the pillar was made about  years ago
the buildings such as stupas and temples also show the skill of country’s crafts persons
these buildings were made of brick and stone
the great stupa at sanchi madhya pradesh was built over several centuries
amaravati was also a place where a magnificent stupa once existed
some finest stone temples were built in towns like mahabalipuram and aihole
building stupas and temples was an expensive affair
therefore only kings and queens decided to build them
they spent money from their treasury to pay the crafts people who worked to build these splendid buildings
the paintings of ajanta are world famous
this is a place where several caves were hollowed out of the hills over centuries
most of these were monasteries and some of them were decorated with paintings
some best-known epics were written during this period
for example—the silappadikaram and the manimekalai
these were tamil epics written by llango and sattanar respectively
writers like kalidasa wrote in sanskrit
his best-known poem is the meghaduta
the puranas which contained religious stories were also written during this time
these were written in simple sanskrit verse and were meant to be heard by everybody including women and shudras

in this he divided indian history into three periods – hindu muslim and british
this periodization came to be widely accepted
we try and divide history into different periods to capture the characteristics of time and its central features as they appear to us
moving away from british classification historians have usually divided indian history into ‘ancient’ ‘medieval’ and ‘modern’
one important source of indian history is the official record of the british administration
the britishers believed that the act of writing was important
every instruction plan policy decision agreement and investigation had to be clearly written up
by the middle of the nineteenth century along with the spread of printing multiple copies of these records were printed as proceedings of each government department
the practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration
these records tell us what the officials thought what they were interested in and what they wished to preserve for posterity
these records always help us understand what other people in the country felt and what lay behind their actions
as printing spread newspapers were published and issues were debated in public
leaders and re¬formers wrote to spread their ideas poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings
history is about the changes that occur over time
it is about the finding out of how things were in the past and how things have changed in the present
as soon as we compare the past with the present we refer to time we talk of ‘before’ and ‘after’
if someone asks you when people began to drink tea or coffee you would fail to answer this question
it is because people did not begin drinking tea on a one fine day they developed the taste for it over time
thus you can only refer to a span of time an approximate period over which particular changes became visible
still we have enough reason why we associate history with a string of dates
there was a time when history was an account of battles and big events
it was about rulers and their policies
historians wrote about the year when a king was crowned the year he married the year he fought a particular battle etc
for such events specific dates were fixed
they became important because we focus on a particular set of events as important
the histories written by british historians in india the rule of each governor-general was important
these histories began with the rule of the first governor-general warren hastings and ended with the last viceroy lord mountbatten
james mill was a scottish economist and political philosopher
in  he wrote a three- volume book a history of british india
in this he divided indian history into three periods- hindu muslim and british
we divide history into different periods in order to capture the characteristics of a time its central features as they appear to us
so the terms through we periodise i
demarcate the differences between periods become important
mill was of the opinion that all asian societies were of the lower level of civilisations than europe
according to his telling of history before the british came to india hindu and muslim despots ruled the country
religious intolerance and caste taboos dominated the social life of indian people
british rule as mill thought could civilise india
the british were absolutely prejudiced in classifying the indian history
so the british classification of the indian history cannot be justified
it is because a variety of faults existed simultaneously along with hindus and muslims in these periods
apart from the british classification historians have divided indian history into ancient medieval and modern
this division to has problems
it is a periodisation that is borrowed from the west where the modern period was associated with the growth of all the forces of modernity such as science reason democracy etc
medieval was the term used to describe a society where these features of modern society did not exist
but the features of modern period were not visible in india during the british rule
many historians therefore refer to this period as colonial
the british established their control over india and made it a colony
colonisation is a term that refers to a process in which one country subjugates another and thus brings political economic social and cultural changes
historians use different sources in writing about the last  years of indian history
one important source is the official records of the british administration
the british believed that the act of writing was important
easy instruction plan policy etc
had to be clearly written up
the british also felt that all important documents and letters needed to be carefully preserved
so they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions
specialised institutions like archives and museums were also set up to preserve important records
the practice of surveying also became common under the colonial administration
in villages revenue surveys were conducted
from the end of the th century census operations were held at the interval of every ten years
it prepared all the detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of india noting information on castes religions and occupation
all these are official records
these records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt and what lay behind their actions
to know about these things we have diaries of people accounts of pilgrims and travellers autobiographies of important personalities etc
all these sources were produced by those who were literate
from these we will not be able to understand how history was experienced and lived by the tribals and the peasants the workers in the mines or the poor on the streets
historian one who writes about the events of the past i
how things were and how they changed
debate discussion on an important topic of public interest
periodisation ponding any event into periods
medieval it refers to the period in which features of modem society did not exist
colonization colonization is a process in which one country subjugates another and thus brings political economic social and cultural changes
subjugation gaining control over a country
calligrapher one who is specialised in the art of beautiful writing
survey the act of examining and recording the measurements features etc
of an area of land to prepare a map or plan for it
 – warren hastings became the first governor-general of india
 – james mill published a massive three-volume work a history of british india
 – the national archives of india came up
trading companies made efforts to maximise profit by eliminating rivals in trade
east india company begins trade in bengal the first factory of east india company which worked as a warehouse and base for the workers of the company was established in 
the workers were known as ‘factors’
as trade expanded the company persuaded merchants to settle near the factory
the battle of plassey sirajuddaulah succeeded ali vardi khan
he faced the armies and the naval fleet of the east india company at plassey in the year 
the british army was led by robert clive who managed to crush the forces of the nawab thus winning the first major battle and making it a historic landmark
the battle of buxar mir jafar became the new nawab and in return he gave huge amounts of revenue to east india company and its officials
east india company felt it as the best way of earning profits and started exchanging with nawabs regularly
mir kasim was made the nawab after mir jafar and when he posed danger to their existence east india company replaced him again by mir jafar
tipu sultan-the tiger of mysore the company engaged in a direct conflict only when a native state became detrimental to the company’s rule in the subcontinent
mysore emerged as a potential threat under haidar ali and his son tipu sultan
war with the marathas the third battle of panipat shattered the dreams of the marathas to rule india from delhi
it also led to the division of maratha confederacy
four chiefs ruled from four centres under a peshwa based in pune
subsidiary alliance a policy introduced by lord wellesley through which indian states were to accept a british resident and had to disband their army
east india company deployed its troops and their maintenance was borne by indian rulers
the doctrine of lapse a law introduced by lord dalhousie which stated that if any ruler of a subsidiary state dies without having a natural heir his state would lapse into east india company empire
the states annexed were satara sambhalpur udaipur nagpur and jhansi
the british originally came to india as a small trading company and were reluctant to acquire territories
ultimately they became the masters of the vast territory
this did not happen overnight
it took a long time
in  the east india company acquired a charter from the ruler of england queen elizabeth i granting it the sole right to trade with the east
the royal charter however could not prevent other european powers from entering the eastern markets
the portuguese established their presence in the western coast of india and got their base in goa
by the early th century the dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the indian ocean
soon the french traders arrived
all the companies wanted to buy the same things such as fine qualities of cotton silk pepper cloves cardamom and cinnamon from the indian market
competition amongst the companies pushed up the prices at which these goods could be purchased and this reduced the profits that could be earned
the only way trading companies could flourish was by eliminating rival competitors
the first english factory was set up on the banks of the river hugli in 
soon the trade expanded and the east india company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory
 it began building^a fort around the settlement
it also bribed mughal officials into giving the company zamindari rights over three villages
one of these was kalikata which later became the city of calcutta or kolkata as it is now called
it also persuaded the mughal emperor aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the company the right to trade duty-free
the officials of the company who were carrying on private trade were expected to pay duty
but they refused to pay which angered the nawab of bengal murshid quli khan
this led to fierce battles
after the death of aurangzeb the bengal nawabs murshid quli khan alivardi khan and sirajuddaulah one after another refused to grant concessions to the company
in such a situation the company began to think about replacing sirajuddaulah with a puppet ruler who would willingly give trade concessions and other privileges
they began helping one of sirajuddaulah’s rivals become the nawab
this finally led to the battle of plassey in which sirajuddaulah got defeated
for the company it was the first victory in india
mir jafar who had deceived sirajuddaulah was made the new nawab of bengal
but mir jafar could not prove himself a puppet ruler for a long time
hence the company deposed him and installed mir qasirifi in his place
when mir qasim complained he in turn was defeated in the battle of buxar in  driven out of bengal and mir jafar was reinstalled who died the next year i
in the same year the mughal emperor appointed the company as the diwan of the provinces of bengal
the company now began to exploit the vast revenue resources of bengal
after the battle of buxar the company appointed residents in indian states
these residents were political or commercial agents and their job was to serve and further the interests of the company
through the residents the company began interfering in the internal matters of indian states
soon the company forced the states into a subsidiary alliance
according to the terms of this alliance indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces
they were to be protected by the company but had to pay for the ‘subsidiary forces’ that the company was supposed to maintain for the purpose of this protection
if the indian rulers failed to make the payment the part of their territory was taken away
awadh and hyderabad for example were forced to cede territories on this ground
whenever the company saw a threat to its political or economic interests it resorted to direct military confrontation
in this regard we can give example of mysore
mysore had become powerful under rulers like haider ali and his son tipu sultan
mysore controlled the profitable trade of the malabar coast where the company purchased pepper and cardamom
tipu sultan stopped the export of sandalwood pepper and cardamom through the parts of his kingdom and disallowed local merchants from trading with the company
the company for this reason fought four wars with mysore
only in the last the battle of seringapatam did the company ultimately win a victory
tipu sultan was killed defending his capital seringapatam
the company also subdued the marathas in a series of wars
from the early th century the company pursued an aggressive policy of territorial expansion
the company now claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme
following this policy the company annexed several states
under governor-general lord dalhousie annexations were at the peak
he devised a policy that came to be known as the doctrine of lapse
the doctrine declared that if an indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would become the part of company territory
satara sambalpur udaipur nagpur and jhansi were annexed by applying this doctrine
in  the company also took over awadh
when warren hastings became the first governor-general of india he introduced several administrative reforms especially in the sphere of justice
in the early th century the british developed a uniform military culture
soldiers were increasingly subjected to european-style training drill and discipline that regulated their life for more than before
thus the east india company was transformed from a trading company to territorial colonial power
mercantile the word refers to a business enterprise that makes profit primarily through trade buying goods cheap and selling them at higher prices
factor the company traders were known at that time as factors
farman a royal order during the mughal period
puppet the term here is used to refer to a person who is controlled by someone else
negotiation a formal discussion between people in order to find a solution
charter an official order or resolution
nabob the british called the nawab as nabob who was the symbol of power and authority
subsidiary alliance as per the terms of this alliance indian rulers were not allowed to have their independent armed forces
they were to be protected by the company
subservience the act of being submissive
paramountcy being paramount or supreme
the doctrine of lapse this was a policy of the company to annex kingdoms
as per this policy if an indian ruler died without a male heir his kingdom would become the part of the company territory

demand of indian indigo india had better weather conditions for the growth of the indigo plant and the french and italian manufacturers used indian indigo for dying the cloth
the cloth manufacturers favoured indigo against the wood plant
cultivation of indigo there were two popular systems in practice—nij and ryoti
in the nij system cultivators grew indigo on their own land
in the ryobi system it was grown on rented land by hired labourers
problem with nij cultivation the problem with nij was that the expansion of area was not possible
scattered small plots wtere available
mobility of labour was low
growing season of indigo clashed with that of rice cultivation season
indigo on the land of ryotis planters extended loans and pressurized peasants or headmen to produce indigo
the planters provided seeds and drill
these contracts never came to an end and the vicious cycle continued
the blue rebellion in march  crippled by the circumstances and suffering cultivators rose in revolt against indigo planters and their indian agents
they were supported by zamindars and headmen
collapse of indigo production the rebellion left the government worried
it set up the indigo commission to inquire into the system of indigo production
the commission held the planters guilty and criticised them for their coercive methods
it declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots
after the assumption of diwani in  the company began to use the vast revenue resources of bengal
now the revenues from india could finance company’s expenses
these revenues could be used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in india
this caused a huge loss of revenue for bengal
the bengal economy fell into deep crisis
artisans began to desert villages because they were being forced to sell their goods to the company at low prices
agriculture cultivation showed signs of collapse
then in  a terrible famine killed ten million people in bengal
finally the company introduced the permanent settlement in 
the rajas and talukdars were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the company
the amount to be paid was fixed permanently
it was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the company’s treasury and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land
but the zamindars were not capable of investing in the improvement of land
the revenue that had been fixed was so high that they found it difficult to pay
by the first decade of the th century the prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded
this meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the company since it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently
the permanent settlement was oppressive for the cultivators
the rent they paid to the zamindars was high and their right on the land was insecure
finding the permanent settlement a failure holt mackenzie an englishman devised a new system called mahalwari settlement which came into effect in 
the collectors were asked to visit villages inspect the land measure the fields and record the customs and right of different groups
the estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village or mahal had to pay
this demand was to be revised periodically
in the british territories in the south ryotwar or ryotwari system was devised
it was initiated by captain alexander read and developed by
this system was gradually extended all over south india
the ryotwari settlement was made directly with the cultivators ryots
all the new systems proved to be failure
the company had imposed these systems in order to increase the income from land but its purpose was not solved becuase the revenue demand was very high
by the late th century the company was trying to expand the cultivation of opium and indigo
indian indigo was in great demand in europe
hence the company in india looked for ways to expand the area under indigo cultivation
in  only about % of the indigo imported into britain was from india
by  the proportion had gone up to %
as the indigo trade grew commercial agents and officials of the company began investing in indigo production
indigo cultivation was done under two systems known as nij and ryoti
within the system of nij cultivation the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled
but it was difficult for planters to expand the area under nij cultivation
indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands and these were all already densely populated
labour was also not easily available
ni cultivation on a large scale also required several ploughs and bullocks
investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem
therefore planters showed reluctance towards expanding the area under nij cultivation
under the ryoti system planters forced the ryots to sign a contract an agreement also known as satta
those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo
but this system was not in favour of the cultivators because they were not given fair prices after the harvest was ready
thus indigo cultivators were highly dissatisfied
several ryots in bengal refused to grow indigo
they got support of the local zamindars and village headmen in their rebellion against the planters
it brought in the military to protect the planters and set up the indigo commission to enquire into the system of indigo production
the commission held the planters guilty
it declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots
hence they were not needed to produce indi§o in future
ultimately indigo production collapsed in bengal
the planters then shifted their operation to bihar
permanent settlement under this settlement it was decided that the rates of revenues once fixed would not be changed
mahalwari settlement under this system the rates of revenues were to be revised periodically not permanently fixed
indigo a plant that produces a rich blue colour
plantations a large farm operated by a planter employing various forms of forced labour
plantations are associated with the production of coffee sugarcane tobacco tea and cotton
woad a plant that produces violet and blue dyes
slave a person who is owned by someone else i
a slave enjoys no freedom and is compelled to work for the master
bigha a unit of measurement of land
there was a significant change experienced by the tribal people after they came into contact with the colonial rule and the outsiders whom they described as ‘dikus’
some of them were hunters and gatherers these people managed their livelihood by hunting wild animals and by gathering forest products such as fruits roots and medicinal shrubs
they also sold the forest products in the local markets and supplied sal and mahua flowers
impact of forest laws tribals were intimately connected with the forests
british regulations made them vulnerable as some forests were declared reserve forest and declared as the property of the state
affect on shifting cultivators the britishers wanted the tribal groups to settle down to bring them under the ambit of revenue assessment
therefore the measurement of land took place
some peasants were declared landowners and others as their tenants
they were forced to pay tributes
they lost the administrative powers that were enjoyed by them previously
search for work the tribals who went far away from their respective homes were the major sufferers
plantation agriculture began in the late th century and they were employed in this industry
their position became pathetic as they were not allowed to go home
the problem with trade moneylenders and traders frequently visited the tribal areas
their motive was to make profit by exploiting the tribals as per their wish
soon the tribals understood their interest and started maintaining distance from them
some were jhum cultivators some tribal communities practised jhum cultivation i
they cleared a patch of the forest and cultivated it for few years and when it lost its fertility they moved to other sites
it is also called slash and burn technique
herded animals there were some groups who lived the life of pastoral nomads
they migrated from one place to another with the change in season along with their livestock in search of fodder
birsa munda birsa munda was born in mid-s in a poor family
his family was moving in the search of work
since his childhood he had seen the elder members of the tribes urging the younger members to rebel against the exploitation
settled cultivation some tribal communities settled down and cultivated the same field year after year
they started using plough and cleared the fields around the chhotanagpur plateau thus they became the first settlers
these were the people of munda tribes
the customs and rituals of tribal societies differ from those laid down by the brahmans
unlike the caste societies the societies of tribals did not have the sharp social divisions
those who belonged to the same tribe shared common ties of kinship
but this did not mean that there were no social and economic differences within tribes
by the th century tribal people in different parts of india were involved in a variety of activities
some tribal people engaged in jhum or shifting cultivation
in this type of cultivation small patches of land were made cleared off trees
the cultivators burnt the vegetation and spread the ash from the firing which contained potash to fertilise the soil
they used equipments like axe and hoe for preparing the soil for cultivation
they did not plough the land and sow the seeds
instead they used to scatter the seeds on the field
once the crop was ready and harvested they moved to another field
shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central india
they saw forests as essential for survival
the khonds were such community living in the forests of orissa
they ate fruits and roots collected from the forest
they used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes and sold forest produce in the local markets
at times they exchanged goods—getting what they needed in return for their forest produce
some of them were engaged in some odd jobs in villages such as carrying loads or building roads etc
but a time came when supplies of produce shrank
as a result more and more tribal people began to wander around in search of work
however baigas remained in the forest
they did not go anywhere
several tribal groups were engaged in heeding and rearing animals
they were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons
the van gujjars of the punjab hills and the labadis of andhra pradesh were cattle herders the gaddis of kulu were shepherds and the bakarwals of kashmir reared goats
many tribal groups preferred to settle down instead of moving from one place to another
they began to use plough and gradually got rights over the land they lived on
the british officials found the settled tribal groups like the gonds and santhals more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators
the british rule however changed the life of the tribal people
the tribal chiefs were considered important people because it is they who controlled their territories
under the british rule they lost their administrative power and were forced to follow law made by british officials in india
the british never liked those tribal groups who moved about and did not have a fixed home
they wanted these tribal groups to settle down
settled peasants were easier to control and administer than people who were always on move
the british also wanted a regular revenue income for the state
hence they introduced land settlements—that is they measured the land defined the rights of each individual of that land and fixed the revenue demand for the state
the british effort to settle jhum cultivators was not very successful
the british brought several changes in forest laws
this affected the tribal lives
the british extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property
in these forests people were not allowed to move freely and practise jhum cultivation
as a result several jhum cultivators moved to other areas
now the british faced a problem of shortage of labour
hence they decided that they would give jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allow them to cultivate these on the condition that those who lived in the villages would have to provide labour to the forest department
after this forest villages were established around the forest department
many tribal groups reacted against the colonial forest laws
during the th century traders and moneylenders began to come into the forests
they offered cash loan to the tribal people and asked them to work for wages
the case of the silk growers is worth-mentioning in this regard
in the th century indian silk was in great demand in european markets
hence the east india company officials tried to encourage silk production to meet the growing demand
the santhals of hazaribagh reared cocoons
the silk traders sent in their agents who gave loans to them to collect the cocoons
the growers were paid three to four rupees for a thousand cocoons
these were then exported to burdwan or gaya where they were sold at five times the price
thus the silk-growers earned very little
the plight of the tribals ^ho had to go far away from their homes for work was even worse
finally the tribal groups in different parts of the country rebelled against the changes in laws the restrictions on their practices the exploitation by traders and moneylenders etc
the movement that birsa munda led is worth-mentioning here
birsa munda himself declared that god had appointed him to save his people from trouble free them from the slavery of dikus outsiders
soon thousands became the followers of birsa
they all were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under british rule
they wanted to recover their golden past
a movement began under the leadership of birsa munda
the political aim of the birsa movement was to drive out missionaries moneylenders hindu landlords and the government and to set up a munda raj with birsa at its head
as the movement spread the british officials arrested birsa in 
in  he was released
afterwards he toured the villages to gather support
he urged people to destroy ‘ravana’ dikus and the europeans and establish a kingdom under his leadership
birsa died in  and the movement initiated by him faded out but its significance cannot be undermined
then they prepare the soil for cultivation
they scatter the seeds on the field
once the crop is ready they move to another land
fallow a field left uncultivated for a while so that the soil recovers fertility
mahua a flower that is eaten or used to make alcohol
bewar it is a term used in madhya pradesh for shifting cultivation
sleeper the horizontal planks of wood on which railway lines are laid
residents stationed at indian states worked effectively so that indian states didn’t join against the east india company
negotiations were put down by the east india company which was aiming to rule delhi
peasants and sepoys peasants and zamindars lost their lands to the moneylenders as rate of revenue was excessively increased due to the new land revenue measures and they could not pay it
indian sepoys were ill paid their religious sentiments were hurt
from meerut to delhi mangal pandey was hanged on th april  for attacking his officer
on tn may  sepoys at meerut were imprisoned as they refused to use the infield rifle
on tnmay  army sepoys released their sepoy companions and killed british officers
the sepoys then captured guns and ammunitions and marched towards delhi
the sepoys stationed at delhi garrison welcomed the sepoys from meerut
the victorious sepoys declared bahadur shah zafar as the emperor of india
zafar unwillingly blessed the rebels and appealed the rulers to form a confederacy against the british
the company fights back the company was determined to suppress the revolt with all its might
it passed laws to demoralise rebels and mobilised troops from all the states and reinforcement arrived from england
delhi was recaptured and gradually other rebel states were also recaptured
aftermath by  british regained control over the rebels
parliament put an end to the east india company rule in india
office of secretary of state was created which was to be advised by the indian council
thus government took the responsibility directly
since the mid-th century nawabs and rajas had gradually lost their power and authority
their freedom reduced their armed forces disbanded and their revenues and territories taken away
the company adopted policies to end the mughal dynasty and thus paved the way for the british government to rule india
many ruling families such as rani lakshmibai of jhansi tried to negotiate with the company to protect their interest but they did not get success
now the company began to plan to bring an end to the mughal dynasty
to make this plan successful the company took several measures
the name of the mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the company
in  it was announced that after the death of bahadur shah zafar the family of the king would be shifted out of the red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in
in  the company decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the last mughal king and after his death his descendants would be called princes
in the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection
the indian sepoys were unhappy about their pay allowances and condition of senice
some of the company’s rule even violated their religious sentiments
thus everywhere there spread discontentment
the responses to the reforms brought in the indian society by the british were also not positive although some reforms were essential
the company passed laws to stop the practice of sati
english language education was promoted
some indians thought that the british were destroying their religion and their social customs while some wanted to change existing social practices
by and by people began to view the british as their common enemy and therefore they rose up against this enemy at the same time
in may  a massive rebellion started that threatened the company’s very presence in india
sepoy mutinied in several places beginning from meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion
on  march  mangal pandey a young soldier was hanged to death for attacking his officers in barrackpore
this was too much for the sepoys
they refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs
thus tension grew between the company and sepoys
the sepoys were determined to bring an end to the company’s rule
from meerut they rushed to delhi
as the news of their arrival spread the regiments stationed in delhi also rose up in rebellion
they killed several british officers seized arms and ammunitions set buildings on fire
they met the mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar and proclaimed him as their leader
the mughal emperor got support from the rulers and chiefs of the country and together they rose against the british power
after the british were routed from delhi there was no uprising for a few days
then a spurt of mutiny began
regiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like delhi kanpur and lucknow
after them the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to fight the british
thus a widespread revolt shook the british confidence over ruling india
the company had no way out except supressing the revolt with all its might
it brought reinforcements from england passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt
the company recaptured delhi from the rebel forces in september 
bahadur shah zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment
he along with his wife were sent to prison in rangoon
the british had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion
the british had regained control of the country by the end of  but they could not carry on ruling the land with the same policies any more
the british parliament passed a new act in  and transferred the powers of the east india company to the british crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of indian affairs
the governor-general of india was given the title of vicerory that is a personal representative of the crown
in this way the british government took direct responsibility for ruling india
all ruling chiefs of the country were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs including adopted sons
however they were made to acknowledge the british queen as their sovereign paramount
sepoy soldier mutiny when soldiers together begin to disobey their officers in the army
firangis foreigners here the term has been used for the englishmen
ghazis religious warriors paramount supreme  – governor-general dalhousie announced that after the death of bahadur shah zafar the family of the king would be shifted out of the red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in
 – i governor-general canning decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the last mughal king and after his death his descendants would be recognised as princes
ii the company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the company’s army had to agree to serve overseas if required
 march  – mangal pandey a young soldier was hanged to death for attacking his officers in barrackpore
may  -sepoys mutinied in several places
 may  – sepoys rushed to delhi from meerut
october  – a new act passed by the british parliament transferred the powers of the east india company to the british crown
de-urbanisation took place as a result of british economic policies
the old manufacturing towns of india such as dacca murshidabad surat etc
delhi became the hub of political parties
the period from  to  is referred to as the period of the delhi renaissance
new delhi was constructed as a -square mile city on raisina hill
two architects edward lutyens and herbert baker designed new delhi and its buildings
the british considered overcrowded places as unhealthy and unhygienic and thus wanted a new city that had better water supply sewage disposal and drainage facilities than the old city
in most parts of the western world modern cities grew with industrialisation
in britain industrial towns like leeds and manchester grew rapidly in the th and th centuries
in india calcutta bombay and madras emerged in importance as presidency cities in the late th century
these presidency cities became the centre of british power in the different regions of india
at the same time cities like machlipatnam surat and seringapatam declined
the historic imperial city of delhi became a dusty provincial town in the th century before it was rebuilt as the capital of british india
as many as  capital cities were founded in a small area of about  square miles on the left-bank of the river jamuna of these the most important are the capital cities built between the th and th centuries
shah jahan built the most splendid capital of all
shahjahanabad was begun in  and consisted of a fort-palace complex and the city adjoining it
the red fort contained the palace complex
delhi during shah jahan’s time was also a centre of sufi culture
it had several dargahs khanqahs and idgahs
even this was no ideal city and its delights were enjoyed only by some
there were sharp differences between the rich-and the poor
in the first half of the th century the british lived along with the wealthier indians in the walled city
they learned to enjoy urdupersian culture and poetry and participated in local festivals
but things did not remain the same after 
during the revolt delhi remained under rebel control for four months
when the british regained it they embarked on a campaign of revenge and plunder
they began to demolish everything that was associated with the mughals
in fact the british were very much annoyed with the mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar to see his active participation in the revolt
they either demolished mosques or put to other uses
for example the zinat-al-masjid was converted into a bakery
no worship was allowed in the jama masjid for five years
one- third of the city was demolished and its canals were filled up
in the s the western walls of shahjahanabad were broken to establish the railway and to allow the city to expand beyond walls
the british now began living in the sprawling civil lines area that came up in the north away from the indians in the walled city
delhi college was turned into a school and shut down in 
delhi emerged into the modern city only after  when it became the capital of the british india
new delhi was constructed as a -square-mile city on raisina hill south of the existing city
two architects edward lutyens and herbert baker were called on to design new delhi and its buildings
it was kept in mind that the new buildings must assert british importance
the idea was to build a city that was a stark contrast to shahjahanabad
there were to be no crowded mohallas no mazes of narrow by-lanes
in new delhi there were to be broad straight streets lined with sprawling mansions set in the middle of large compounds
the architects wanted new delhi to represent a sense of law and order in contrast to the chaos of old delhi
in  india got independence but at the same time it was partitioned into india and pakistan
this led to a large migration from punjab that changed the social background of delhi
an urban culture largely based on urdu was overshadowed by new tastes and sensibilities in food dress and the arts
inside the old city the excellent system of water supply and drainage was neglected in the th century
the system of wells or baolis also broke down and channels to remove household waste were damaged
the population of delhi was continuously growing at this time
the broken-down canals could not serve the needs of this ever-growing population
at the end of the th century a new system of open surface drains was introduced
but this system too was soon overburdened
the delhi municipal committee was not willing to spend money on a good drainage system
at the same time millions of rupees were being spent on drainage systems in the new delhi area
the havelis or grand mansions in which the mughal aristocracy lived in the th and th centuries also declined gradually
in fact the mughal amirs were unable to maintain these large establishments under conditions of british rule
havelis therefore began to be subdivided and sold
the colonial bungalow was quite different from the haveli
it was a large single-storeyed structure with a pitched roof and usually set in one or two acres of open ground
the census of  revealed that the walled city area was crowded with as many as  persons per acre while new delhi had only about  persons per acre
the poor conditions in the walled city did not stop it from expanding
in  an extension scheme called the lahore gate improvement scheme was planned by robert clarke for the walled city residents
streets strictly followed the grid system and were of identical width size and character
land was divided into regular areas for the construction of neighbourhoods
but even this scheme could not decongest the old city
the delhi improvement trust was set up in  and it built areas like daryaganj south for wealthy indians
houses were grouped around parks
within the houses space was divided according to new rules of privacy
urbanisation it is a process by which more and more people began to reside in towns and cities
dargah it refers to a tomb of a sufi saint
khanqah it refers to a sufi lodge often used as a rest house for travellers and a place where people came to discuss spiritual matters got the blessings of saints and hear sufi music
idgah it refers to an open prayer place of muslims primarily meant for id prayers
cul-de-sac street with a dead end
gul farosan a festival of flowers renaissance literary rebirth of art and learning
it is a term often used to describe a time when there is great creative activity
baolis the system of wells haveli a grand mansion amir a nobleman during the mughal period  – shahjahanabad was begun
 – delhi college was established
- – a period of delhi renaissance
 – an extension scheme called the lahore gate improvement scheme was planned by robert clarke for the walled city residents
 – the capital of india was shifted from calcutta to delhi
 – the delhi improvement trust was set up
from the th century european trading companies began buying indian textiles for sale in europe
printed cotton clothes were called chintz cossies or khassa and bandanna
the tata iron and steel company tisco began producing steel in 
the industrialisation of britain had a close connection with the conquest and colonisation of india
english east india company’s interest in trade led to the occupation of territory and the pattern of trade changed over the decades
in the late th century the company was buying goods in india and exporting them to england and europe making profit through the sale
with the growth of industrial production british industrialists began to see india as a vast market for their industrial products and very soon manufactured goods from britain began flooding india
this badly affected indian crafts and industries
just take the example of indian textiles
needless to say that indian textiles were world famous for their quality and craftsmanship
from the th century european trading companies began buying indian textiles for sale in europe
here it is worth mentioning that indian textiles were famous in western markets under different names such as muslin calico etc
printed cotton cloths were called chintz cossies or khassa and bandanna
from the s there started a craze for printed indian cotton textiles in england and europe mainly for their beautiful floral designs fine texture and to relative cheapness
the popularity of indian textiles during the early th century worried the wool and silk makers in england
they began protesting against the import of indian cotton textiles
unable to compete with indian textiles english producers wanted a secure market within the country by preventing the entry of indian textiles
the first to grow under government protection was the calico printing industry
indian designs were now imitated and printed in england on white muslin or plain unbleached indian cloth
competition with indian textiles led to a search for technological innovation in england
the invention of spinning jenny in  and steam engine in  revolutionised cotton textile weaving
cloth could now be woven in large quantities and cheaply too
however indian textiles continued to dominate world trade till the end of the th century
european trading companies made huge profits out of this flourishing trade
in india textile production was concentrated in four regions in the early th century — bengal dacca in eastern bengal now bangladesh regions along the coromandel coast and gujarat
however indian textiles began to decline with the development of cotton industries in britain and by the beginning of the th century english-made cotton textiles successfully ousted indian goods from their traditional markets in africa america and europe
this badly affected the weavers of india
bengal weavers were the worst hit
english and european companies stopped buying indian goods
the situation became worse by the s when british cotton cloth flooded indian markets
this affected both specialist weavers and spinners
thousands of rural women who made a living by spinning cotton thread became jobless
however handloom weaving continued to exist to some extent
this was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines
machines failed to produce saris with intricate borders or cloths with traditional woven patterns
many weavers and spinners who lost their livelihood now became agricultural labourers
some migrated to cities in search of work and yet others went out of the country to work in plantations in africa and south america
some handloom weavers got employment in the new cotton mills that were established in different parts of india
the first cotton mill in india was set up as a spinning mill in bombay in 
afterwards mills came up in other cities too for example ahmedabad and kanpur
the textile factory industry faced various problems in the beginning
indian wootz steel which was produced all over south india fascinated european scientists
however the wootz steel making process was completely lost by the mid- th century
the reason behind this was that when the british conquered india the imports of iron and steel from england began to displace the iron and steel produced by the crafts people in india
as a result several iron smelters lost their job
the demand for iron produced by them inevitably lowered
by the early th century the artisans producing iron and steel faced a new competition with the coming of iron and steel factories in india
the tata iron and steel company tisco began producing steel in 
soon in  first world war broke out
steel produced in britain now had to meet the demands of war in europe
so imports of british steel into india declined and the indian railways that was expanding at that time turned to tisco for supply of rails
it was the best moment for the tisco to flourish
the war dragged on for several years and tisco had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war
by  the colonial government was buying % of the steel manufactured by tisco
over time tisco became the biggest steel industry within the british empire
chintz it is derived from the hindi word chintz which is a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs
bandanna the word refers to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head
originally the term derived from the word ‘bandhna’ and referred to a variety of brightly- coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying
spinning jenny a machine by which a single worker could operate several spindles on to which thread was spun
when the wheel was turned all the spindles rotated
charkha and takli household spinning instruments
the thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli
rangrez the dyer who dyed the thread
smelting the process of obtaining a metal from rock or soil by heating it to a very high temperature or of melting objects made from metal in order to use the metal to make something new
bellows a device or equipment that can pump air
slag heaps the waste left when smelting metal
 – the british government enacted legislation banning the use of printed cotton textiles—chintz
 – spinning jenny was invented
 – steam engine was invented
 – the first cotton mill in india was established in bombay
 – the tata iron and steel company tisco began producing steel
they believed that the ancient customs of the country and oriental learning ought to be the basis of the british rule in india
education for commerce it was believed that indians would be able to understand the advantages of trade and commerce through european learning
western influence would change the lifestyle of educated indians so that they would readily accept british goods
what happened to local schools earlier local schools or pathshalas were allowed to function without much interference
but after  the british standardized the curriculum imposed routines established rules and ensured regular inspections of these schools
new routines new rules the britisher’s government-appointed officials who were made in-charge of four to five schools
teaching was now according to a regular timetable
students wrote examinations paid a regular fee and obeyed the new rules of discipline
they felt that western education would help in modernization of india
they urged the british to open more schools colleges and universities and spend more money on education
gandhi’s view on western learning gandhi argued that colonial education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of indians and destroyed the pride they had in their own culture
tagore’s ‘abode of peace’ tagore felt that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment
therefore in  he set up his school shanti niketan in a rural setting where children lived in harmony with nature and cultivated their natural creativity
the british in india established their rule over the entire country
but their task was not completed with the establishment of control
they felt that they had a cultural mission
they had to civilise the natives by giving them proper education and by changing their customs and values
for this it was necessary to study indian history philosophy and law
william jones an expert in law and a linguist took this task
he began to study ancient indian texts on law philosophy religion politics morality arithmetic medicine and the other sciences
englishmen like henry thomas colebrooke and nathaniel halhed were also busy discovering the ancient indian heritage mastering indian languages and translating sanskrit and persian works into english
jones and colebrooke shared a deep respect for ancient cultures
both of india and the west indian civilisation they felt had attained its glory in the ancient past but had subsequently declined
in order to understand india it was necessary to discover the sacred and legal texts that were produced in the ancient time
jones and colebrooke went about discovering ancient texts understanding their meaning translating them and making their findings known to others
several company officials got influenced by these ideas
they felt that the hindus and the muslims ought to be thught what they were already familiar with and what they valued and treasured not subjects that were alien to them
it was thought that this was the only way the british could win the hearts the ‘natives’ and could get respect from them
a madrasa was set up in calcutta in  to promote the study of arabic persian and islamic law
in  the hindu college was established in benaras to encourage the study of ancient sanskrit texts that would be useful for the administration of the country
they began to criticise the orientalist vision of learning
they strongly disapproved the british effort to encourage the study of arabic and sanskrit language and literature
james mill was one of those who attacked the orientalists
he was of the opinion that indians should be made familiar with the scientific and technical advances that the west had made rather than with the poetry and sacred literature of the orient
thomas babington macaulay another critic of orientalists saw india as an uncivilised country that needed to be civilised
he emphasized the need to teach indians the english language
finally the english education act of  was introduced
the decision was to make english the medium of instruction for higher education and to stop the promotion of oriental institutions like the calcutta madrasa and benaras sanskrit college
in  an educational despatch popularly known as wood’s despatch was sent to india
outlining the educational policy that was to be followed in india
it emphasised once again the practical benefits of a system of european learning
wood’s despatch argued that european learning would enable indians to recognise* the advantages that flow from the expansion of trade and commerce and make them see the importance of developing country’s resources
european learning would also improve the moral character of indians
it would make them truthful and honest and thus supply the company with civil servants who could be trusted
the british took several measures to uplift the indian’s educational system
they set up education departments of the government
universities were established in calcutta madras and bombay
upto the mid-th century the company’s primary concern was to improve higher education
afterwards it also took steps to improve the condition of local schools
in s william adam a scottish missionary was given the charge by the company to tour the districts of bengal and bihar
he was asked to report on the progress of education in local schools
adam found that the system of education in the local schools known as pathshalas was flexible
there were no fixed fee no benches or chairs no system of separate classes no annual examinations etc
in some places classes were held under a banyan tree in other places in the corner of a village’s shop or temple or at the guru’s home
teaching was oral and the guru decided what to teach
after the company got adam’s report it immediately took decision to improve the system of vernacular education
the task of the pandit was to visit the pathshalas and try to improve the standard of teaching
new routines and rules were introduced
teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination
students were asked to pay regular fee attend regular classes sit on fixed seats and obey the new rules of discipline
not only the british officials but several indians too wanted to spread english education in the country
the indians felt that western education would help modernise india
hence they urged the british to open more and more schools colleges and universities
at the same time there were other indians too such as mahatma gandhi and rabindranath tagore who were dead against western education
mahatma gandhi argued that coloured education created a sense of inferiority in the minds of indians
he felt that indian languages ought to be the medium of teaching
education in english crippled indians distanced them from their own social surroundings and made them strangers in their own land
with the spread of nationalist movement other thinkers also began thinking of a system of national education which would be different from that one set up by the british
rabindranath tagore started shantiniketan in 
he was of the view that creative learning could be encouraged only within a natural environment
so he chose to set up his school  kilometres away from calcutta in a rural setting
he saw it as an abode of peace i
shantiniketan where living in harmony with nature children could cultivate their natural creativity
linguist one who knows and studies several languages
native original inhabitant of the land
orientalists those with a scholarly knowledge of the language and culture of asia
munshi a person who can read write and teach persian
vernacular it refers to a local language or dialect as distinct from the standard language
minute a short note on a subject
despatch a message or report
 – a madrasa was set up in calcutta
 – the hindu college was set up in benaras
 – the english education act was enacted
 – wood’s despatch was issued
 – rabindranath tagore established shantiniketan
their condition was pathetic which was manifested in various social evils such as child marriage female infanticide sati system etc
raja rammohan roy and his brahmo samaj were pioneers in championing the emancipation of women
ishwarchandra vidyasagar keshab chandra sen rabindranath tagore derozio begum rokeya shekhawat hossain all worked for the emancipation of women
a number of women associations were formed which created social consciousness and also voiced public opinion on certain important issues related to women
about two hundred years ago our society was not as it is now
it had imposed many barriers on women
they could not go to school they could not marry according to their wilt etc
in some parts of the country sati pratha existed and widows were praised if they chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands
the society that existed in those days was also caste-based
people were divided along lines of caste
brahmans and kshatriyas were considered as upper caste
after them traders and moneylenders were placed
then came peasants and artisans
at the lowest rung were those whose job was to keep cities and villages clean
there were also untouchables who were considered inferior by the so called upper-caste people
things have been greatly changed now
women are now enjoying better position in every field
they are getting high education and are doing jobs after that
though caste-feeling is not completely rooted out but its intensity has been minimized considerably
it took long years to take place
from the early th century debates and discussions began to take place in order to root out the evils that had crippled our society for years
these debates were often initiated by indian reformers and reform groups
raja rammohun roy was one such reformer
he founded the brahmo samaj in calcutta
he wanted to spread western education in the country
he advocated for women education
he strongly disapproved the system of sati
many british officials also criticised indian traditions and customs
they supported raja rammohun roy
finally sati pratha was banned in 
ishwarchandra vidyasagar was a great social reformer
british officials supported his cause and passed a law in  that permitted widows to re- marry
swami dayanand saraswati founder of arya samaj also supported widow re- marriage
these reformers felt that in order to improve the condition of women it was necessary to educate them
for this purpose several schools were opened for girls by the efforts of vidyasagar and other reformers
people reacted sharply against sending girls to schools
hence they were taught at homes throughout the th century
in aristocratic muslim families in north india women learnt to read the koran in arabic
they were taught by women who came home to teach
muslim women like the begums of bhopal did a lot for the promotion of education among women
they set up a primary school for girls at aligarh
begum rolceya sakhawat hossain also opened schools for muslim girls in places like patna and calcutta
by the s indian women began to take university education
some of them trained to be doctors while some became teachers
many women began to write and publish their critical views on the status of women in society
for instance tarabai shinde published a book named stripurushtulna
pandita ramabai wrote a book about the pathetic condition of upper-caste hindu widows
she set up a widow home at poona in order to give shelter to widows
however women ultimately began to enjoy greater freedom
and from the s some of them even joined various kinds of nationalist and socialist movements
caste inequalities had cippled our society
reformers made sincere efforts to root out these evils from society
in bombay the paramhans mandali was founded in  to work for the abolition of caste
during the course of the th century christian missionaries became active
they set up schools for tribal groups and lower caste children
but at the same time the people from low caste in order to get rid of the exploitation from upper-caste began to migrate to cities where there was new demand for labour
they demanded social equality and justice
in this connection we can mention the satnami movement in central india initiated by ghasidas who came from a low caste
in eastern bengal haridas thakur’s matua sect worked among low caste chandala cultivators
haridas questioned brahmanical texts that supported the caste system
jyotirao phule also a low-caste leader attacked the brahmans claim that they were superior to others since they were aryans
he proposed that shudras labouring castes and ati shudras untouchables should unite to fight against caste discrimination
x he founded satyashodhak samaj that propogated caste equality
in  he wrote a book named gulamgiri meaning slavery
ambedkar and ramaswami naicker continued the movement for caste reform in the th century
ambedkar belonged to a mahar family
as a child he experienced what caste prejudice meant in everyday life
he remembered how he was forced to sit outside the classroom on the ground and not allowed to drink water from taps meant for upper-caste children
these systems were very depressing
in  he started a temple entry movement which was resented by the brahman priests
the non-brahman movement began in the early th century
it was initiated by qualified and wealthy non-brahman castes
they challenged brahmanical claims to power
ramaswamy naicker popularly known as periyar founded the self respect movement
he inspired untouehables to fight for their dignity and self-respect
he was also a great critic of hindi scriptures
several associations were established and movements started by our reformers in order to make indian society free from all evils
a glimpse of these associations and movements have been given below
the brembo samaj founded by raja rammohun roy in  to prohibit all forms of idolatry and sacrifice
derozio and young bengal — henry louis vivian derozio a teacher at hindu college calcutta initiated the young bengal movement in the s to promote radical ideas and encourage his students to question all authority
the ramakrishna mission and vivekananda
vivekananda established the ramakrishna mission to stress the ideals of salvation through social service and selfless action
established in  at bombay the prarthana samaj worked for removing caste restrictions encouraging the education of women etc
it was established in 
it worked to abolish caste distinctions and promote widow remarriage and women’s education
sayyid ahmed khan founded the mohammedan anglo-oriental college in  at aligarh
it later became famous as the aligarh muslim university
the institution offered modern education
it is known as the aligarh movement
this movement sought to free sikhism from superstitions caste distinctions and practices seen by them as non-sikh
sati it means virtuous women
these women chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands
untouchable untouchables were considered to be the lowest by the upper-caste people
they were denied entry in temples restaurants etc
gulamgiri a book written by jyotirao phule
stripurushtulna a book published-by tarabai shinde
it means a comparison between women and men
conservative those who want to stick to old traditions and customs and oppose new changes
- – raja rammohun roy brought a lot reformations in the indian society during this period
 – sati was banned
 – a law was passed to permit widow remarriage
 – the arya samaj was founded
 – the child marriage restraint act was passed
- – ambedkar led three temple entry movements between this period
they painted what they perceived in india
they brought with them new techniques such as oil paintings which made painting lifelike
these new art forms were instantly adopted by indian artists
looking for picturesque in this kind of painting style india was depicted as an unexplored land with wild and untamed landscape
thomas and william daniell were two painters who projected india in this way
their paintings had great demand in britain as people wanted to know about the company’s new empire
what happened to the court artists the court of mysore resisted the new trends and its ruler tipu sultan encouraged local traditions such as mural paintings on the walls
in the states conquered by british painters adopted the change and one such example was use of perspective in their paintings
the new popular indian art in the early th century new popular forms of indian art developed in various parts of india
in bengal local scroll painters were developed around pilgrimage centres
these painters moved to new cities and developed new art forms such as kalighat the search for national art nationalism also spread through the media of paintings
many painters attempted to develop an art style that could be considered modem as well as indian
the art of raja ravi varma ravi varma belonged to the royal house of travancore and attempted to develop an art style that could be modern as well as national
he mastered the western oil paintings and realistic life study but painted scenes from indian mythology
this group rejected raja ravi varma’s style to be considered as national
they laid emphasis on the spiritual essence of the east rather than of the west in the paintings
a lot of changes came in the world of visual arts during the british period in india
a colonial rule introduced many new art forms styles materials and techniques which were creatively adapted by indian artists for local patrons and markets in both elite and popular circles
a stream of european artists who came to india from the th century brought with them new styles and new conventions of painting
the pictures that they produced shaped western perceptions of india
these artists introduced the idea of realizing
this was based on careful observation and the faithful defection of scenes which they saw with their own eyes
the technique of oil painting which was a new thing for the indian artists was also introduced
this type of painting enabled artists to produce images that looked real
the european artists chose varied subjects for their paintings but they never missed to emphasize the superiority of britain—its culture and its people its power
picturesque landscape painting was a popular imperial tradition
this style of painting depicted india as a quaint land to be explored by traveling british artists its landscape was rugged and wild seemingly untamed by human hands
thomas daniell and his nephew william daniell painted within this tradition
they produced of the most evocative picturesque landscapes of britains newly conquered regions in india
portrait painting was another tradition of art in colonial india
the portraits were life-size images that looked lifelike and real
the size of the paintings itself projected the importance of the patrons who commissioned these portraits
as a result many european portrait painters came to india in search of profitable commissions
the name of johann zoffany is worth- mentioning in this connection
the third category of imperial art is known as history painting
this tradition sought to dramatise and recreate various episodes of british imperial history
british victories in india provided a rich material for history painters in britain
these paintings once again celebrated the british their power their victories their supremacy
imperial history paintings sought to create a public memory of imperial triumphs
in mysore tipu sultan not only fought the british on the battlefield but also resisted the cultural traditions associated with them
he continued to encourage local traditions and had the walls of his palace at seringapatam covered with rural paintings done by local artists
the court of murshidabad had a different trend
here after defeating sirajuddaulah the british had successfully installed their puppet nawabs mir zafar and mir qasim on the throne
the court at murshidabad encouraged local miniature artists to absorb the tastes and artistic styles of the british
as the british established their power in india several local courts lost their influence and wealth
they could no longer support painters and pay them to paint for the court
as a result many painters turned to the british who welcomed them
british officials wanted images through which they could understand india remember their life in india and depict india to the western world
they began producing a vast number of images of local plants and animals historical buildings and monuments festivals and processions trades and crafts castes and communities
as these pictures were collected by the east india company officials they became famous as company paintings
there were also painters who were not associated with any court
these painters developed a new world of popular art in many of the cities of india during the th century
in bengal around the pilgrimage center of the temple of kalighat local village scroll painters potters began developing a new style of art
they moved from the surrounding villages into calcutta in the early th century in the life of new patrons and new buyers of their art
before the th century the village pastures and potters had painted on mythological themes and produced images of gods and goddesses
but the images were not realistic and lifelike
after the s they began producing paintings on social and political themes
many of these kalighat pictures were printed in large numbers and sold in the market
in the beginning the images were engraved in wooden blocks
the carved block was inked pressed against paper and then the woodcut prints that were produced were colored by hand
in this way many copies could be produced from the same block
by the late th century mechanical printing presses were established which allowed prints to be produced in even larger numbers
as a result these prints became accessible for the poor too
middle-class indian artists also set up printing presses and produced prints for a wide’ market
in many of them one can see bharat mata appearing as goodness carrying the national flag or nationalist heroes sacrificing their head to the mata and gods and goddesses slaughtering the british
the images of india were produced by photographers too
european photographers traveled to india and took pictures
they set up studios and established photographic societies to promote the art of photography
towards the end of the th century the painters began to develop a style that could be considered both modern and indian
raja ravi verma was one of the first artists who created such a style
he mastered the western art of oil painting and realistic life study but painted themes from indian mythology
his mythological paintings became popular among indian princes and art collectors
however the nationalist artists in bengal did not approve the art of ravi verma because it was imitative and westernized
they declared that such a style was unsuitable for depicting the nation’s ancient myths and legends
they felt that a true indian style of painting had to draw inspiration from non-western art traditions and try to capture the spiritual essence of the east
they broke away from the convention of oil painting and the realistic style and turned to for inspiration to medieval indian traditions of miniature painting and the ancient art of mural painting in the ajanta caves

league and the independent states the all india muslim league moved a resolution demanding “independent states” for muslims in the s
the league located its “independent states” in the north-western and eastern areas of the country
after the revolt of  people of india became determined to root out british rule from the country
as awareness spread among them they began to feel that india was for the people of india and its resources were meant for all the indians
unless british control over the resources of india and its people was ended india could not be for indians
hence the first and foremost task of every indian was to fight against the foreign rule unless and until it was rooted out
the more important ones were the poona sarvajanik sabha the indian association the madras mahajan sabha and the bombay presidency association
the aim of all these associations was to empower indians so that they might take decisions regarding their affairs
the british were aware of all these developments
they began to take action
in  the arms act was passed which disallowed indians from possessing arms
in the same the vernacular press act was passed which tried to silence all those who were critical of the government
finally in  the indian national congress came into being
in the beginning the congress was more or less moderate in its objectives and methods
it demanded a greater^oice for indians in the government and in administration
it also demanded separation of the judiciary from the executive the repeal of the arms act and the freedom of speech and expression
congress in the early years also raised several economic issues
it declared that an increase in the land revenue had impoverished peasants and zamindars
hence reduction of revenue was essential
the moderate leaders in the congress published newspapers wrote articles and showed how british rule was leading to the economic rain of the country
all this they did in order to draw public attention towards the unjust rule of the british
some leaders in the congress such as bipin chandra pal bal gangadhar tilak and lala lajpat rai did not like the ideas of the moderates
they criticized the moderats for their ‘politics of prayers’ and emphasized the importance of self-reliance and constructive work
they argued that people must fight for swaraj
tilak raised the slogan “freedom is my birthright and i shall have it”
in  bengal the biggest province of british india and included bihar and parts of orissa was partitioned by viceroy curzon
it enraged people all over india
both the moderates and the radicals unitedly oppressed the british action
this led to the birth of the swadeshi movement which boycotted british institutions and goods
an important development came in  with the formation of the all india muslim league at dacca
the founder members of the league were muslim landlords and nawabs
they supported the partition of bengal and demanded for separate electorates for muslims
however in the year  the congress and the muslim league decided to work together for representative government in the country
the growth of mass nationalism began to take place after 
peasants tribals students and women became involved in the struggle against british rule
he first of all toured the entire country in order to understand the people their needs and the overall situation
afterward he led to local movements in champaran kheda and ahmedabad in which he got immense success
in  gandhiji started satyagraha movement against the rowlatt act that the british had just passed
the act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers
in april  there were a number of demonstrations and hartals in the country against this act
the government used hartal measures to suppress them
the jallianwala bagh atrocities in amritsar on baishakhi day were a part of this suppression
in the year  the british did another wrong known as khilafat wrong
the british imposed a harsh treaty on the turkish sultan also known as khalifa
this enraged the muslims and khalifa agitation started under the leadership of mohammad ali and shaukat ali
they wished to initiate a full-fledged non-cooperation movement
gandhiji supported their call and urged the congress to campaign against jallianwala massacre khilafat wrong and demand swaraj
during the years - the non-cooperation movement gained momentum because it got a wide support
however it was abruptly called off by mahatma gandhi when in february  a crowd of peasants set fire to a police station in chauri chaura
twenty-two policemen were killed on that day
it hurt mahatma gandhi because he had never thought that people would go violent
he always wished to drive away the british by non-violent methods
the congress now resolved to fight for purna swaraj complete independence in  under the presidentship of jawaharlal nehru
now efforts began to be made in this direction
in  gandhiji started dandi march against the salt law
he got immense support from the people
the combined struggles of the indian people bore fruit when the government of india act of  prescribed provincial autonomy and the government announced elections to the provincial legislatures in 
in september  the second world war broke out
the congress leaders were ready to support the british war effort
but in return they wanted independence after the war
the british refused to concede the demand
a new phase of movement popularly known as quit india movement was initiated in august  under the leadership of mahatma gandhi
as a result prominent leaders were jailed at once
mahatma gandhi was not in favour of this
the league began to think that muslims were a minority and they would always have^ to play second fiddle in any democratic structure
the congress’s rejection of the leagues desire to form a joint cohgress-league government in the united provinces in  further annoyed the league
in  the british opened negotiations between the congress the league and themselves for the independence of india
the talks failed because the league now wanted pakistan
in march  the british cabinet sent a three-member mission to delhi to examine the league’s demand for pakistan and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free india
the mission suggested that india should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for muslim majority areas
neither the congress nor the league agreed to it
now partition of india became inevitable

pakistan emerged as a new country
this resulted in the mobilization of a large number of people
a constitution was formed constitution is a written document which lays out the working of the government of the country
moreover the rights and duties of the citizens are also mentioned in the constitution
a large population with diversity the indian population at the time of independence was  million
the people followed different faiths spoke different languages and followed different cultures
therefore many people opined that india could never unite as a nation
the problem of development was also attached to this
constituent assembly in order to frame the constitution for india constituent assembly was appointed
it had members from all parts of the country
it met between december  and november 
discussions and debates were held on different issues in order to frame the constitution which could be acceptable by all
features of the indian constitution indian constitution conferred universal adult franchise to all its citizens above the prescribed age limit
another feature of the indian constitution was a provision of equality before law
one important feature included in the constitution was the provision of special privileges for poor and backward groups
power sharing constituent assembly spent many days in discussing the issue of sharing of power between the central government and the state governments
discussions led to the division of powers between the centre and states
national language many leaders were of the view that hindi should be recognized as the national language but leaders of non-hindi states opposed this opinion
ambedkar was the chairman of the drafting committee
his responsibility was to draft the constitution after compiling the reports of all the committees
the demand of the linguistic states nationalist leaders were reluctant to form states on the basis of languages or religions as a country had already undergone the trauma of partition
potti sriramullu went on hunger strike and died after  days of strike which made the condition worse
the mixed economy model was chosen for india
second five-year plan in  the second five-year plan was formulated
it laid stress on the development of the heavy industries and building of dams
the nation after sixty years on august th  india celebrated its  years of independence
in its  years india has remained free and democracy exists in india
however divisions are still persisting in indian society
communal violence and caste discrimination still exist in india
partition created a number of problems for independent india
first and foremost task was to rehabilitate the refugees who had come into the country from the newly born pakistan
then there was the problem of the princely states
these two problems needed an immediate solution
afterward the new nation had to adopt a political system that would best serve the hopes and aspirations of its people
the population of india in  was about  million
one could observe a lot of diversities in the country regarding languages foods dresses professions etc
there was wide gap between high castes and low castes
in spite of all these diversities people had to live together in one nation-state
this created the problem of unity
the problem of development was another major point
indian economy was very weak at the time the country got freedom
farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival
in the cities factory workers lived in crowded slums with little access to education or health care
the new nation had to da a lot of work in order to eradicate poverty illiteracy etc
it had to increase productivity of agriculture and promote new job-creating industries
a written constitution was essential for the country
for this a series of meetings on the country’s political future was held
as a result the indian constitution came into being on  january 
the constitution adopted universal adult franchise
all indians above the age of  would be allowed to vote in state and national elections
later it was reduced to ′ years
a third feature of the constitution was that it offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged indians
the practice of untouchability was abolished
a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government was reserved for members of the lowest castes
along with the former untouchables the advasis or scheduled tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs
like the scheduled castes these indians too had been deprived and discriminated against
in order to maintain balance between the central government and that of the state governments the constitution provided three lists of subjects—a union list with subjects such as taxes defence and foreign affairs which would be sole responsibility of the centre a state list with subjects such as education and health which would be taken care of mainly by the states a concurrent list under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture in which both the centre and states would have joint responsibility
the language was also an important point
several members of the constituent assembly wanted to replace english language with hindi
but non-hindi speakers had different opinion
they wanted english language to be continued
therefore a compromise was finally arrived at
it was resolved that while hindi would be the ‘official language’ of india english would be used in the courts the services and communication between one state and another
another major problem was that of the formation of state
both prime minister nehru and deputy prime-minister vallabhbhai patel were against the creation of linguistic states
nehru clearly said that he had to check disruptionist tendencies caused due to partition and make the nation strong and united
this caused great disappointment among the kannada speakers malayalam speakers the marathi speakers and the telugu speakers
the strongest protest came from the telugu-speaking districts of the madras presidency
in october  a veteran gandhian named potti sriramula went on a hunger fast demanding the formation of andhra state to protect the interests of telugu speakers
as the fast went on it attracted much support
hartals and bandhs were observed in many towns
finally the new state of andhra pradesh came into being on  october 
now other linguistic communities also began to demand their own separate states
the large hindi-speaking region of north india was broken up into several states
in  the state of punjab was also divided into punjab and haryana
now planning for development began to be made
lifting india out of poverty and building a modern technical and industrial base was ‘among the major objectives of the new nation
in  the government set up a planning commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development
in  the second five year plan was formulated which focused strongly oh the development of heavy industries
sixty-two years of independence have passed
this is not a short duration
a lot has been achieved in this time but at the same time there have been a number of failures
successes india is still united and it is still democratic
 there is a free press
 there is an independent judiciary
failures  deep divisions persist
 despite constitutional guarantee the untouchables or the dalits face violence and discrimination
 the gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over years
refugee a person who has been forced to leave his country because of some political social or religious reasons
franchise the right to vote
state concerned with the government

frederic sorrieu and his visualization in  frederic sorrieu a french artist prepared a series of four prints visualizing his dream of a world made up of ‘democratic and social republics’ as he called them
the first print shows the people of europe and america marching in a long train and offering homage to the statue of liberty as they pass by it
a female figure carries a torch of enlightenment in one hand and the charter of the rights of man in the other hand
on the earth lies the shattered remains of the symbols of absolutist institutions
in sorrieu’s utopian vision the people of the world are grouped as distinct nations identified through their flags and national costumes
leading the procession are usa and switzerland followed by france and germany
following germany are austria kingdom of the two sicilies lombardy poland england ireland hungary and russia
from the heavens above christ saints and angels gaze at the scene
the artist symbolizes fraternity among the nations of the world

example mazzini’s young italy and young europe
unification of italy giuseppe mazzini had played an important role in the unification of italy
he formed a secret society called ‘young italy’ in marseilles to spread his goals
during ’s mazzini sought to put together a coherent programme for a unitary italian republic
as uprisings in  and  had failed the mantle now fell on sardinia-piedmont under its ruler emmanuel ii to unify italy
under chief minister cavour sardinia-piedmont succeeded in destroying the austrian forces in 
even garibaldi joined the fray
in  they marched into south italy and the kingdom of the two sicilies and with the help of the local peasants drove out the spanish rulers
in  victor emmanuel ii was proclaimed as king of united italy
unification of germany in the th century germany was divided into a number of states
some of these states ceased to exist during the napoleonic wars
at the end of the war there were still  independent states in germany
prussia was most powerful dominated by big landlords known as junkers
 nationalist feelings were widespread among middle class germans who had tried to unite the different regions of the german federation into a nation- state governed by an elected parliament
their representatives met at frankfurt and the frankfurt assembly proposed the unification of germany as a constitutional monarchy under the king of prussia as emperor  the king of prussia rejected the offer and the liberal initiative of nation building was repressed by the combined forces of the monarchy the military and the ‘junkers’
 then on prussia under its chief minister otto von bismarck led the movement for unification of germany
bismarck carried out this process with the help of the prussian army and the bureaucracy
he fought three wars over seven years with denmark austria and france
prussia was victorious in all these wars and the process of unification was completed as a result of prussia’s victory over france
 consequently on th january  an assembly comprising of princes of german states representatives of the army important prussian ministers and bismarck gathered in the palace of versailles and proclaimed the prussian king kaiser william the new german emperor
visualizing the nation marianne and germania were both female allegories used by artists in the th century to represent the nation
in france she was named marianne a popular christian name which underlined the idea of a people’s nation
her characteristics were drawn from those of liberty and republic—the red cap the tri-colour the cockade
statues of marianne were erected in public squares as a national symbol of unity
marianne images were marked on coins and stamps
instead of just having the idea of father land they wanted to implant a suitable image in the minds of the people
they invariably chose the mother figure symbolizing nations—britannia germania and marianne reminding us of our concept of matribhumi
germania became the allegory of the german nation
germania wears a crown of oak leaves as german oak stands for heroism
it was hung from the ceiling of st
paul’s church where frankfurt parliament was convened to symbolize the liberal revolution
the first major change was doing away with all privileges based on birth establishing equality before law and securing the right to property
feudal system was abolished and peasants were freed from serfdom and manorial dues abuse of manorial lords
in towns guild restrictions were removed
transport and communication systems were improved
peasants artisans workers and new businessmen enjoyed a new found freedom
businessmen and small-scale producers of goods in particular began to realize that uniform laws standardized weights and measures and a common national currency would facilitate the movement and exchange of goods and capital from one region to another
nationalism and imperialism last quarter of the th century nationalism became a narrow creed with limited ends intolerance balkan became the sense of big power rivalry nationalism aligned with imperialism cause of world war i
idea of a nationalism was now same everywhere
but concept of national state was accepted universally
views of paul bernard paul bernard was an influential writer and policy-maker who strongly believed that the purpose of acquiring colonies was to make profits
 according to him the development of economy will raise the standard of people and people would buy more goods
the market would consequently expand leading to better profit for french business
 according to him there were several barriers to economic growth in vietnam such as large population low agricultural productivity and extensive indebtedness
 industrialization was also essential for creating more jobs as agriculture was not likely to ensure sufficient employment opportunities
ho chi minh trail  the trail symbolizes how the vietnamese used their limited resources to great advantage
 the trail an immense network of footpaths and roads was used to transport men and material from north to south
 it was improved in late s and from  about  north vietnamese troops came south each month
the trail had support bases and hospitals along the way
 mostly supplies were carried by women porters on their backs or on their bicycles
 the us regularly bombed this trail to disrupt supplies but efforts to destroy this important supply line by intensive bombing failed because they were rebuilt very quickly
influence of japan in - around  students from vietnam went to japan to acquire modem education
the primary objective was to drive out the french from vietnam overthrow the puppet emperor and reestablish the nguyen dynasty that had been deposed by the french
for this they needed foreign help
japan had modernized itself and had resisted colonization by the west
it had defeated russia in  and proved its military strength
the vietnamese nationalists looked for foreign arms and help and appealed to the japanese as fellow asians
vietnamese students established a branch of restoration society in tokyo but in  the japanese ministry of interior clamped down on them
many including phan boi chau were deported and forced to seek exile in china and thailand
scholars revolt  it was an early movement against french control and spread of christianity
there was an uprising in ngu an and ha tien provinces where the catholic missionaries had been active in converting people to christianity since the early th century
by the middle of the th century nearly  people had got converted
this had angered the people of these provinces and led to the uprising
though this uprising was crushed by the french it had inspired the people of other regions to rise against the french colonialism
hoa hao movement it began in  and gained popularity in mekong delta area
the founder of hoa hao was huynh phu so
he performed miracles and helped the poor
his criticism against useless expenditure opposition to the sale of child brides gambling and the use of alcohol and opium had a wide appeal
the french tried to suppress the movement led by huynh phu so and declared him mad called him the mad bonze and put him in a mental asylum
interestingly the doctor who had to certify him insane became his follower and finally in  the french doctors declared that he was sane
the french authorities exiled him to laos and sent his many followers to concentration camps
major problems in the field of education for the french in vietnam 
the french needed an educated local labor force but they feared that once the vietnamese got educated they may begin to question colonial domination
french citizens living in vietnam called ‘colons’ feared that they might lose their jobs as teachers shopkeepers policemen to the educated vietnamese
so they opposed the policy of giving the vietnamese full access to french education
elites in vietnam were still powerfully influenced by chinese culture
so the french carefully and systematically dismantled the traditional vietnamese education system and established french schools for the vietnamese
in the battle against french colonial education schools became an important place for political and cultural battles
students fought against the colonial government’s efforts to prevent the vietnamese from qualifying for white-collared jobs
there was a protest in saigon girls school on the issue of racial discrimination
the protest erupted when a vietnamese girl sitting in the front row was asked to move back to allow a local french student to occupy the front seat
the government was forced to take the expelled students back in the school to avoid further open protests
the modem city of hanoi got infested with rats in  and was struck by bubonic plague
the large sewers in the modem part of the city served as breeding grounds for rats
to get rid of the rats a ‘rat hunt’ was started
the french hired vietnamese workers and paid them for each rat they caught
this incident taught the vietnamese the first lesson of collective bargaining
those who did the dirty work of entering sewers found that if they came together they could negotiate a higher bounty
they also discovered innovative ways to profit from the situation
the bounty was paid when a tail was given as a proof that a rat had been killed
so the rat catchers began clipping the tails and releasing the rats so that the process could be repeated over and over again
defeated by the resistance of the vietnamese the french were forced to scrap the bounty programme
bubonic plague swept through the area in  and in subsequent years
in a way the rat menace marks the limits of french power and contradiction in their civilizing mission
entry into the war  us entry into the war proved costly to the vietnamese as well as to americans
the phase of struggle with the us was brutal
 from - many over  us personnel served in vietnam out of which  were women
many died in battle and a large number of people were wounded
 thousands of us troops arrived equipped with heavy weapons and tanks backed by most powerful bombers of the time—bs
the widespread attacks and use of chemical weapons — napalm agent orange and phosphorous bombs destroyed many villages and decimated jungles
civilians died in large numbers
effect of the us involvement on life within the us most of the people were critical of the government’s policy of war
when the youths were drafted forced recruitment for the war the anger grew
us media played a major role in both supporting and criticizing the war
hollywood made films in support of the war
example john wayne’s green berets 
other films were more critical
example john ford coppola’s apocalypse now  reflected the moral confusion that the war caused in the us
role of women  in the s photographs in magazines and journals showed women as brave fighters
there were pictures of women militia shooting down planes
women were portrayed as young brave and dedicated
 women were represented not only as warriors but also as workers
they were shown with a rifle in one hand and a hammer in the other

they helped in nursing the wounded constructing underground rooms and tunnels and fighting the enemy
 of the  youth who worked on the trail  to  per cent were women
gandhiji’s novel method of mass agitation is know as ‘satyagraha’
gandhiji believed that if the cause is true if the struggle is against injustice then physical force was not necessary to fight the oppressor
a satyagrahi can win the battle through non-violence
people including oppressors had to be persuaded to see the truth
truth was bound to ultimately triumph
in india the first was at champaran in  to inspire plantation workers to struggle against oppressive plantation system
in  satyagraha at kheda to support peasants
‘hind swaraj’ the famous book written by mahatma gandhi which emphasized non- cooperation to british rule in india
new economic situation created in india by the first world war 
manchester imports into india declined as the british mills were busy with war production to meet the needs of the army paving the way for the indian mills to supply for the huge home market 
as the war prolonged indian factories were called upon to supply war needs
as a result new factories were set up new workers were employed and everyone was made to work longer hrs
cotton production collapsed and exports of cotton cloth from britain fell dramatically after the war as it was unable to modernize and compete with us germany japan
hence within colonies like india local industrialists gradually consolidated their position capturing the home market
the rowlatt act of  it gave the british government enormous power to repress political activities and allowed detention of political prisoners without trial for two years
jallianwala bagh incident on th april  a crowd of villagers who had come to attend a baisakhi fair gathered in the enclosed ground of jallianwala bagh

 in the gudem hills of andhra pradesh a militant guerrilla movement spread in the early s against the closure of forest areas by the colonial government preventing people from entering the forests to graze their cattle or to collect fuel wood and fruits
they felt that their traditional rights were being denied
 for plantation workers in assam freedom meant the right to move freely in and out of the confined space in which they were enclosed
it meant retaining a link with the village from which they had come
in fact the permission was hardly granted
when they heard of the non-cooperation movement thousands of workers defied the authorities and left for their homes
slowing down of non-cooperation movement in cities  khadi cloth was more expensive than mill cloth and poor people could not afford to buy it
as a result they could not boycott mill cloth for too long
 alternative indian institutions were not there which could be used in place of the british ones
these were slow to come up
 so students and teachers began trickling back to government schools and lawyers joined back work in government courts

south india was not included in this map
babur in the early th century used the term hindustan in order to describe the geography the fauna and the culture of the inhabitants of the subcontinent
amir khusrau used the term hind in a similar sense in the th century
with the change of time we observe that the idea of a geographical and cultural entity like ‘india’ did exist but the term hindustan did not carry the political and national meanings which we associate with it today
we trace out many changes in the use of words with the change of time
for example the word ‘foreigner’ is used in the sense of one who is not an indian whereas it was in the medieval period used in the sense of one who was a part of the same village but not a part of a particular society or culture
the synonymous words for ‘foreigner’ in hindi and persian are ‘pardesi and ‘ajnabi’ respectively
historians use different sources to study the past depending upon the period of their investigation
coins inscriptions architecture and textual records are still the basic sources
during the period of  to  we trace out a dramatic increase in the variety of textual records
its basic reason was that paper gradually became cheaper and more widely available
it was extensively used in writing the holy texts chronicles of rulers letters and teachings of saints petitions and judicial records and for registers of accounts and taxes
manuscripts collected from wealthy people rulers monasteries and temples were placed in libraries and archives
these manuscripts and documents helped the historians with several detailed information though it is difficult to use them
as there was no printing press in those days scribes used to copy down manuscripts by hand
hence they were somewhere not very legible
some changes in words and sentences were also made in fact not knowingly in the manuscripts while copying
it poses a serious problem to determine which the original one was
the authors used to revise their chronicles from time to time
ziyauddin barani a th century author revised his chronicle for the first time in  followed by another version two years later
in fact the two versions differed from each other but as the original one was traceless nobody could claim for the difference
the period between  and  was a phase of transition as a lot of developments took place
the persian wheel in irrigation the spinning wheel in weaving and firearms in combat were some of the examples of developments
the subcontinent saw new food like potatoes corn chillies tea and coffee
the new technologies and crops came along with the migrants who also brought other ideas with them
it was a period of economic political social and cultural changes and also of great mobility
people travelled to far off lands to make their fortune
rajputs one of the prominent communities were the group of warriors between the eighth and fourteenth centuries
they were the ‘kshatriyas’ by caste status
they included the rulers chieftains soldiers and commanders serving in the armies of the different monarchs all over the subcontinent
extreme valour and a great sense of loyalty were the prominent qualities of this community
marathas sikhs jats ahoms and kayasthas a caste of scribes and secretaries were the other prominent classes of people
this period witnessed a gradual clearing of forests and the extension of agriculture
it caused changes in people’s ‘habitat’ which forced many of the forest-dwellers to migrate
some others adopted tilling the land and became peasants and soon became part of large complex societies
they were also put under tax cover as per their status which gave rise to many jatis i
the divisions of sub-castes were made on the basis of their backgrounds and occupations
ranks were variable as per the change in power influence and resources controlled by members of the jati
this status of the same jati varied from area to area
jatis had their own system of ruling
they framed rules and regulations in order to manage their own people
an assembly of elders called jati panchayat was responsible for enforcing the regulations
villages constituted only one small unit of a state and were governed by a chieftain
the subcontinent was divided into several regions which were ruled by empires of different dynasties
by  several regions developed their distinct geographical dimensions and their own cultural characteristics
during the period of  and  the thousand years of history that we are exploring here there were significant developments in religious traditions
the changes were seen in people’s beliefs
hinduism saw a great many changes which included the worship of new deities the construction of temples by royalty and growing dominance of brahmanas and the priests
for their knowledge of sanskrit texts brahmanas earned great respect in society
the new rulers were their patrons
the most significant development of the period was the rise of the idea of bhakti which also paved the rise of many new religions in the subcontinent
the teachings of the holy quran was brought to india in the seventh century by the migrants
quran is the most prominent holy book of the muslims which delineates the idea of one god allah and his love bounty and mercy for those who believe in him
islam and the ulema—the learned theologians and jurists were patronized by many rulers
like hinduism islam was also interpreted in many ways and the followers of islam were divided in two sub-sects—shias and sunnis
hence for the historians it becomes convenient to study time by dividing it into segments—periods—that possess shared characteristics
in the middle of the nineteenth century the history of india was divided into three periods — hindu muslim and british
it was done so because there was no significant historical development other than religion
this periodisation is followed by some of the historians even today
cartographer the artist who is skilled in drawing or making maps
chronicler one who writes history or pens down the events of the time from the historical point of view
manuscripts the original script written by the author in hisher own handwriting
habitat the living condition of specie
patron a person with influence and affluence who provides support with money and mental boost up to an artist a craftsman a learned man or a noble or some other persons of such categories
jati the sub-caste which was defined or identified on the basis of one’s profession status and influence
region the particular area designated or occupied by a certain group or empire
periodisation division of time into different segments for the purpose of study from the historical point of view
it was done on the basis of dominant factors of the time
in the middle of the nineteenth century british historians divided the history of india into three periods—hindu muslim and british
seventh century ad – the teachings of the holy quran brought to india
 – map of the indian subcontinent made by al-ldrisi
- – reign of the delhi sultan ghiyasuddin balban
 – ziyauddin barani wrote his first chronicle
he wrote another version two years later
the emergence of new dynasties  by the th century there were big landlords or warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent
 existing kings often acknowledged them as their samantas or subordinates
 they were expected to bring gifts for their kings or overlords and provide them with military support
 the main ruling dynasties were gurjara-pratiharas palas rashtrakutas and chahamans in north india and the chola pandyas and  chalukyas in south india
administration in the kingdoms  the kings at apex adopted big titles like maharaja-adhiraja
 the kings shared power with their samanras and with an association of peasants traders and brahmanas
 resources were obtained from the producers who were persuaded to surrender part of what they produced
 these resources were used to finance the king’s establishment and construct temples and forts
 functionaries for collecting revenue were recruited from influential families
prashashtis and land grants  prashashtis tells us how rulers wanted to depict themselves as valiant and victorious warriors
 the kings often rewarded brahmanas by grants of land
these were recorded on copper plates which were given to those who received the land
warfare for wealth  for centuries gurjara-pratihara rashtrakuta and pala’s dynasties fought for control over kannauj
 the long drawn conflict is known as a tripartite struggle as three parties were involved in it
 sultan mahmud of ghazni raided the subcontinent seventeen times between ad —ad 
his sole purpose was to plunder the wealth of india
he looted temples like somnath gujarat mahmud entrusted a scholar named al-biruni to write an account of the subcontinent
 chauhans were engaged in conflict with chalukyas of gujarat and the gahadavalas of western ur prithviraj iii was a popular chauhan ruler who defeated afghan ruler ghori in  but lost to him in 
the cholas  cholas were from a small family of uraiyur
the successors of vijayalaya conquered neighbouring regions and the kingdom grew in size and power
 rajaraja i was considered the most powerful chola ruler and expanded control over most of these areas
 his son rajendra i conquered sri lanka and countries of southeast asia
 cholas were big temple builders
two famous temples were in thanjavur and gangaikondacholapuram
 agriculture was well developed along with various methods of irrigation
 settlements of peasants called or became prosperous with the spread of irrigation in agriculture
the village council and the nadu performed several administrative functions  association of traders known as nagarams also performed administrative functions in the town
 inscriptions also mention about sabha
the sabha had separate committees to look after irrigation works gardens temples etc
during the period of seventh and twelfth centuries many new dynasties emerged in different parts of the subcontinent
the new rulers were previously the big landlords or warriors working under the existing kings as subordinates or samantas
they gradually gained power and wealth and thereafter declared themselves to be maha-samanta maha-mandleshwar the great lord of the circle or region
they were now independent lords
dantidurga a rashtrakuta chief overthrew his chalukya overlord and performed a ritual known as hiranya-garbhk literally the golden womb
it was done in order to transform one’s identity as kshatriya even if one was not one by birth
some other lords like kadamba mayurashrman and gurjara-pratihara harichandra brahmanas by birth used their military skills to establish their kingdoms in karnataka and rajasthan
many of these new kings adopted high-sounding titles like maharaja-adhiraja great king overlord of kings tribhuvana-chakravartin lord of the three worlds though they shared power with their samantas as we as with associations of peasants traders and brahmanas
the producers—the peasants cattle-keepers artisans—were the main feeders to these states
the land was owned by the lords and so the producers were compelled to pay rent to the owners whereas traders were to pay revenue to the lords
the revenue functionaries were recruited from influential families and positions were often hereditary
similar was the case with army positions
in most cases such posts were held by the close relatives of the king
prashastis were composed by learned brahmanas in praise of the rulers
it used to depict the rulers as valiant victorious warriors
brahmanas were also rewarded by grants of land
kalhana’s long poem in sanskrit recorded the history of kings who ruled over kashmir
he usually used a variety of sources including inscriptions documents eyewitness accounts and earlier histories in order to present his accounts
ruling dynasties were based in a particular region
kanauj was a prized area in the ganga valley
there was a tripartite struggle among gurjara- pratihara rashtrakuta and pala dynasties over kanauj
rulers used to build large temples in order to demonstrate their power and resources
so temples were the first target of when one ruler attacked over the other
one prominent reason for this was that the temples were often very rich
sultan mahmud ghazni of afghanistan — extended his control over parts of central asia iran and the north-western part of the subcontinent
during his attacks he targeted wealthy temples of which the temple of somnath in gujarat was the most prominent
al-baruni’s kitab al-hind an arabic work written on the request of sultan is an important source for historians
al-baruni also consulted the sanskrit scholars while preparing this book
some other notable kings engaged in war were chahamanas later known as chauhans ruled over the region around delhi and ajmer and made efforts to expand their control to the west and the east
they were opposed by the chalukyas of gujarat and gahadavalas of uttar pradesh
prithviraja iii - § who defeated an afghan ruler sultan muhammad ghori in  but lost to him the very next year in  was the most popular of the chahamanas
muttaraiyar the subordinates to the pallava kings of kanchipuram held power in the kaveri delta
the town of thanjavur and a temple for goddess nishumbhasudini there were some of his major creations
vijayalaya’s successors expanded their kingdom in size and power adding the pandyan and the pallava territories to the south and north to their kingdom
rajraja i was the most famous and powerful chola ruler who became king in  and thereafter expanded control over most of these areas
his son rajendra i also added to the glory of his father
the big temples of thanjavur and gangaikonda-cholapuram built by rajaraja and rajendra are architectural marvels
the temples of cholas were the nuclei of settlements that grew around them
they were also centres of craft production and were also endowed with land by rulers as well as others
the produce of the land were spared to maintain the specialists working at the temple and usually lived near it
they were the priests garland makers cooks sweepers musicians dancers etc
temples were not only the place of worship but they were the hub of economic social and cultural life as well
the making of bronze images of the deities was the most distinctive of the crafts associated with the temples
chola bronze images are still considered the best in the world
the development of agriculture contributed much to the achievements of the cholas
although agriculture had developed earlier in other parts of tamil nadu it was only from the fifth or sixth century that this area was opened up for large scale cultivation
forests had to be cleared in some areas while land had to be levelled in some other regions
embankments were built to prevent flood and canals were constructed to carry water to the fields
in many areas two crops were grown in a year
a variety of methods like digging of wells placing huge tanks were used for irrigation
most of the new rulers as well as people living in villages were actively involved in these activities
ur the settlement of peasants grew prosperous with the spread of irrigation agriculture
groups of such villages formed larger units called nadu performed several administrative functions including dispensing justice and collecting taxes
rich peasants of the vellala caste controlled over the affairs of the nadu under the supervision of the central chola government
some rich landowners were honoured with the titles like vendavelan a velan or peasant serving three kings araiyar chief etc
and they were also entrusted with important offices of the state at the centre
as brahmanas often received land grants or brahmadeya a large number of brahmana settlements emerged in the kaveri valley as in other parts of south india
each brahmadeya was looked after by an assembly or sabha of prominent brahmana landholders which worked efficiently
their decisions were recorded in detail in inscriptions on the stone of walls of temples
associations of traders known as nagarams also occasionally performed administrative functions in towns
there were separate committees to look after different works like that of irrigation temples etc
the allocation of work was decided through a lottery system
samantas the subordinates of kings or overlords who used to bring gifts for their kings or overlords
maha-samanta or maha-mandaleshwara the samantas who gained power and wealth declared themselves maha-mahabaleshwar or maha-samantas i
the great lord of a circle or region
maharaja-adhiraja a high sounding title used for great king overlord
tribhuvan-chakravartin lord of the three worlds
rent the part of the product that the producers—the peasants cattle-keepers artisans- were compelled to pay to the lords
revenue the tax traders had to pay to their lords
prashastis a literary composition often in verse written in praise of the ruler depicting him as a valiant victorious warrior
it was mainly done by the brahmanas who were often rewarded by grants of land for such jobs
this reward was recorded on copper plates and given to those who received the land

thth century – the area of tamil nadu was opened up for large-scale cultivation
the transformation of delhi into a capital that controlled a vast area of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the delhi sultanate at the beginning of the th century
rulers of delhi tomars early th century 
chauhans - prithviraj chauhan - under the tomaras and chauhans delhi became an important commercial centre
slave dynasty - in  razia the daughter of sultan iltutmish became the sultan of delhi
she was removed from the throne in 
khilji dynasty - external frontier was the next phase of expansion which started with alauddin khilji in southern india
alauddin khilji the most important ruler of khilji dynasty introduced the system of market control and administrative measures in order to maintain a large standing army
tughlaq dynasty - external frontier culminated with muhammad-bin-tughluq and he introduced three projects – shifting of capital from delhi to daulatabad the introduction of token currency raising the land tax in the doab region to fifty per cent—all of which failed and weakened his position
sayyid dynasty - it was the only shia dynasty lodi dynasty - finding out about the delhi sultans  inscriptions coins and architecture provide a lot of information
 further valuable sources are ‘histories’ tarikh singulartawarikh plural written in persian the language of administration under the delhi sultans
 the authors of tawarikh were learned men secretaries administrators poets and courtiers who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance emphasizing the importance of the just rule
 delhi’s authority was challenged by mongols and by governors who rebelled at any sign of the sultan’s weakness
 the expansion of delhi sultanate took place under the reign of balban alauddin khilji and muhammad- bin-tughlaq
administration and consolidation  to have reliable governors the early delhi sultans especially iltutmish’ favoured their special slaves purchased for military service called ‘bandage’ in persian
 the khiljis and tughluqs continued to use bandage and also raised people of humble birth who were their clients to high positions like governors and generals
 the khiljis and tughluqs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying sizes
 these lands were called iqta and their holder was called muqti or iqtadar
the duty of muqtis was to lead military campaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas
 in return muqtis collected the revenues of their assignments as salary
they also paid their soldiers from this revenue
 under alauddin khilji and muhammad tughluq accountants were appointed to check the amount collected by the muqtis
 as delhi sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control they forced the samants and the rich landlords to accept their authority
 the attack of mongols under genghis khan forced khiljis and tughluqs to mobilise a large standing army in delhi
the sultanate in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries  the tughluq the sayyid and lodi dynasties ruled from delhi and agra until 
 by then jaunpur bengal malwa gujarat rajasthan and entire south india had independent rulers who had established flourishing states and prosperous capitals
 new ruling dynasties like the afghans and rajputs also arose during the period
 in  mughals established their empire
 sher shah suri challenged and defeated the mughal emperor humayun
he captured delhi and established his own dynasty
although he ruled for only fourteen years - but his administration became the model followed by the great mughal emperor akbar - when he consolidated the mughal empire
delhi became the capital of a kingdom under the tomara rajputs
it was only under the rule of the tomars and chauhans that delhi flourished as an important commercial centre
the city was inhabited by many jaina merchants who also constructed a number of temples
coins known as dehliwal were minted here and had a wide circulation
inscriptions coins and architecture provide a lot of information but especially significant are “histories” tarikh singulartawarikh plural written in persian the language of administration under delhi sultan
tawarikh were written by learned men secretaries administrators poets and courtiers who lived in cities mainly delhi
they were written for the sultans with anticipation of rich rewards
they also advised rulers on governance emphasizing the importance of just rule based on birthright and gender distinctions not shared by everyone
raziyya the daughter of sultan lltutmish became the sultan of delhi in  but she was dethroned only in  only for being a woman and was unacceptable to the nobles
famous chronicler of the age minhaj-i siraj recognized her as more able than all her brothers but was not comfortable with her only for her being a lady
in the early thirteenth century there was no significant expansion of delhi beyond heavily fortified town occupied by garrisons it was only during the reigns of ghiyasuddin balban alauddin khalji and muhammad tughluq that delhi saw expansion for the first time
the expansion was initiated with the internal frontier
forests were cleared in the ganga- yamuna doab and hunter-gatherers and pastoralists expelled from their habitats and these lands were given to the peasants in order to promote agriculture
regional trades were also promoted
external frontier was the next phase of expansion which started with alauddin khalji in southern india and culminated with muhammad tughluq
the armies of delhi sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent till the reign of muhammad tughluq
they defeated rivals seized cities
the sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry
the early delhi sultans favoured the appointment of their slaves purchased for military service as governors to control the administration of the vast empire
these slaves were totally dependent upon their master and so they were more reliable and trustworthy
they were called bandagan in persian
the khaljis and tughluqs continued the use of bandagan and also raised people of humble birth usually their clients to high positions and appointed them as generals and governors
however this also gave rise to political instability as there was often a conflict for succession
this system was criticised by the elites and authors of tawarikh because for them the new high class people were in fact ‘low and base-born’
these territories were called iqta and their holders were called iqtadar or muqti
muqtis were responsible for leading their military campaigns and maintaining their iqtas
accountants were appointed by the state to check the amount of revenue collected by muqtis who were not allowed to collect revenue more than that prescribed by the state nor were they allowed to keep soldiers more than the number prescribed by the state
delhi sultans had complete control over the hinterland of the cities and so the samanta aristocrats were forced to accept their authority
during alauddin khalji’s regime the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its control
there were three types of taxes   on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about  per cent of the peasant’s produce  on cattle and  on houses
as the large part of the subcontinent was outside the control of delhi sultan it was difficult to control distant provinces like bengal from delhi
hence soon after annexation of southern india the entire region became independent
the local chieftains established their rule in these regions
the mongols led by genghis khan invaded transoxiana in north-east iran in 
such attacks frequented during the reign of alauddin khalji and in the early days of muhammad tughluq’s rule
this forced the two rulers to mobilize a large standing army in delhi
it posed a huge administrative challenge
after tughluqs the sayyid and lodi dynasties ruled from delhi and agra until 
by that time jaunpur bengal malwa gujarat rajasthan and entire south india had independent rulers who established flourishing states and prosperous capitals
it was during this period that some new ruling groups like the afghans and the rajputs emerged
some small but powerful and extremely well-administered states also emerged
sher shah sur — was the most powerful of them all
he even challenged the mughal emperor humayun and captured delhi
in a very short period of fifteen years - he introduced many reforms and a lot of welfare works
his administration became the model followed by the great emperor akbar — when he consolidated the mughal empire

the mughals were great rulers
they created a huge empire
from the latter half of the th century they expanded their kingdom from agra and delhi until in the th century they controlled nearly all the subcontinent
the mughals were descendants of two great lineages of rulers
from their mother’s side they were descendants of genghis khan ruler of the mongol tribes china and central asia
from their father’s side they were the successors of jimur the ruler of iran iraq and modern day turkey
however the mughals were proud of their jimurid ancestry
babur was the first mughal emperor he became the ruler of delhi by defeating ibrahim lodi at panipat in 
he also established his control over agra
but he could not rule for a long time
after his death in  his son humayun became the second mughal emperor

aurangzeb also faced the rebellion in north india of the sikhs jats and satnamis
the mughals followed the mughal and timurid custom of loparcenary inheritance or a division of the inheritance amongst all the sons
one of the major policies of the mughals was to campaign constantly against rulers who refused to accept mughal authority
however several rulers joined them voluntarily
many rajputs married their daughters into mughal families to gain high positions
but at the same time there were many rajputs such as the sisodiya rajputs who resisted the mughal authority
the mughai empire was expanding to different regions
hence the mughals recruited diverse bodies of people
those who joined mughal service were enrolled as mansabdars
these mansabdars held a mansab meaning a position or rank
rank and salary of the mansabdars were determined by a numerical value called zat
mansabdars received their salaries as revenue assignments called jagirs
in akbar’s reign these jagirs were carefully assessed so that their revenues were roughly equal to the salary of the mansabdar
by aurangzeb’s reign this was no longer the case
the actual revenue collected was often less than the granted sum
the main source of income available to mughal rule was tax on the produce of the peasantry
akbar’s revenue minister was todar mai
he carried out a carefully survey of crop yields prices and areas cultivated for a -year period i
on the basis of this data tax was fixed on each crop in cash
each province was divided into revenue circles with its own schedule of revenue rates for individual crop
this revenue system was known as zabt
abul fazl one of the akbar’s friends and courtiers wrote a three-volume history of akbar’s reign titled akbar nama
the subadar carried out both political and military functions
each province also had a financial officer or diwan
akbar’s nobles commanded large armies and had access to large amounts of revenue
by the end of the th century these nobles became independent
during the  akbar started discussions on religion at fatehpur sikri with the ulama brahmanas jesuit priests who were roman catholics and zoroastrians

 two technological and stylistic developments from the twelfth century are ‘arcuate architectural’ form and use of limestone mixed with stone chips that led to faster construction
 assimilation of indian style with persian style of architecture was prominent

the other lesser deities in the temples were gods and goddesses of the allies and subordinates of the ruler
 muslim sultans and padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god but persian court chronicles described the sultan as the ‘shadow of god’
 as each new dynasty came to power kings wanted to emphasise their moral right to be rulers
 it was widely believed that the rule of a just king would be an age of plenty when the heavens would not withhold rain
why were temples destroyed  since kings built temples to demonstrate their devotion to god and their power and wealth they attacked and targeted these buildings when they attacked one another’s kingdoms
 in the early th century when the chola king rajendra i built a shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prized statues seized from defeated rulers
gardens tombs and forts  under the mughals architecture became more complex
babur humayun akbar jahangir and shah jahan were personally interested in literature art and architecture
 babur got gardens called chahar bagh four gardens built in kabul
they were further constructed in kashmir agra and delhi by akbar jehangir and shah jahan
 akbar’s architecture is visible in his father humayun’s tomb
 the ceremonial halls of the public and private audience diwan-i-khas diwan-i-am were carefully planned
 shah jahan adapted the chahar bagh technique in the layout of the taj mahal the grandest architectural accomplishment of his reign
region and empire  as construction activity increased between the eighth and eighteenth centuries there was also a considerable sharing of ideas across regions
 in vijayanagar for example the elephant stables of the rulers were strongly influenced by the style of architecture found in the adjoining sultanates of bijapur and golconda
 in vrindavan near mathura temples were constructed in architectural styles that were very similar to the mughal palaces in fatehpur sikri
 the creation of large empires that brought different regions under their rule helped in this cross¬fertilisation of artistic forms and architectural styles
 the mughals adopted the ‘bangla dome’ in their architecture
between the eighth and the eighteenth centuries kings and their officers built two kinds of structures—the first were forts palaces garden residences and tombs and the second was structures meant for public activity including temples mosques tanks bazaars etc
merchants and others also carried out construction activity
they built temples mosques and wells
the technologies used in the monuments are unique
it requires sophisticated skills in making a large room with an elaborate superstructure
between the seventh and tenth centuries architects started adding more rooms doors and windows to building
between the eighth and thirteenth centuries the trabeate style a style of architecture in which roofs doors and window were made by placing a horizontal beam across two vertical columns was used in building temples mosques etc
the early eleventh century temples were decorated with elaborately carved sculptures
the temples had shikhara too
from the twelfth century two technological and stylistic developments came to be noticed— firstly the weight of the superstructure above the doors and window was sometimes carried by arches
this architectural form was known as ‘arcuate’ secondly limestone cement was increasingly used in construction
temples and mosques were built to demonstrate the power wealth and devotion of the patron
here it is worth mentioning that the name of the ruler and the god are very similar
the king took the god’s name because it was auspicious and he wanted to appear like a god
but muslim sultans and padshahs did not claim to be incarnations of god
however persian court chronicles described the sultan as the ‘shadow of god’
rulers offered patronage to the learned and pious people
rulers also built tanks and reservoirs and got praise
sultan lltutmish won universal respect for constructing a large reservoir just outside delhi-i kuhna
it was called the hanzi sultani or the king’s reservoir
kings built temples but they often looted them while attacking one another’s kingdoms
in the early th century when the chola king rajendra i built a shiva temple in his capital he filled it with prised statues seized from defeated rulers
sultan mahmud of ghazni attacked the temples of defeated kings and looted their wealth and idols
under the mughal rulers gardens tombs and forts were built
babur was interested in planning and laying out formal gardens placed within rectangular walled enclosures and divided into four quarters by artificial channels
these gardens were called chahar bagh four gardens because of their symmetrical division into quarters
during akbar’s reign tomb architecture became important
his architects turned to the tombs of his central asian ancestors timur
the central towering dome and the tall gateway pishtaq were important aspects of mughal architecture first visible in humayun’s tomb
during shah jahan’s reign huge construction activity was carried on in agra and delhi
shah jahan’s audience halls were specially constructed to resemble a mosque
he adapted the river-front garden in the layout of the taj mahal
here the white marble mausoleum was placed on a terrace by the edge of the river and the garden was to its south
shah jahan developed this architectural form as a means to control the access that nobles had to the river
in the new city of shahjahanabad that he constructed in delhi the imperial palace commanded the river-front
only especially favoured nobles were given access to the river
in bengal the local rulers had developed a roof that was designed to resemble a thatched hut
the mughals liked this ‘bangla dome’
in akbar’s capital at fatehpur sikri many of the buildings show the influence of the architectural styles of gujarat and malwa
superstructure it refers to the part of a building above the ground floor
baolis they were large stepped-wells
shikhara the top-most point of the temple
arcuate an architectural form in which the weight of the superstructure above the doors and windows was sometimes carried by arches
pietra dura coloured hard stones placed in depressions carved into marble or sandstone creating beautiful ornate patterns
diwan-i khas or am the ceremonial halls of public and private audience
hasht bihisht or eight paradises a central hall surrounded by eight rooms

the emergence of small towns  from the th century onwards small towns emerged in india
they emerged from large villages
they had a ‘mandapika’ where villagers sold their produce
 likewise there were market streets called ‘hatta’ full of shops
 many villagers came to buy local articles and sell products like horses camphor saffron betel nut spices salt etc

the textiles of surat were famous for their gold lace borders known as zari and had a market in west asia africa and europe
there were three types of medieval towns—a temple town an administrative centre and a commercial town or a port town
thanjavur the capital of the cholas a thousand years ago emerged as an administrative centre as well as a temple town
the perennial river kaveri flows near this beautiful town
the famous rajarajeshvara temple built by king rajarja chola lies here
as thanjavur was an administrative centre kings held courts in the mandapas which were parts of palaces issuing orders to their subordinates
temple towns represent a very important pattern of urbanisation the process by which cities develop
– ‘ rulers built temples to demonstrate their devotion to various deities
pilgrimage centres also developed into townships
examples—vrindvan in uttar pradesh and tiruvannamalai in tamil nadu
small towns emerged from large villages
they usually had a mandapika or mandi of later times to which nearly villages brought their produce to sell
they also had market streets called hatta or heat of later times lined with shops
different kinds of artisans such as potters oil pressers sugar makers toddy makers smiths etc
also lived in these towns
there were many kinds of traders
they usually travelled in caravans and formed guilds to protect their interests
there were also communities like the chettiars and the marwari oswal
gujarati traders traded extensively with the ports of the red sea persian gulf east africa south-east asia and china
indian spices such as pepper cinnamon nutmeg etc
became very popular in european homes
indian cotton cloth was also in great demand
this eventually drew european traders to india
the craftspersons of bidar were very famous
their inlay work in copper and silver came to be known as bidri
the panchalas or vishwakarma community consisting of goldsmiths bronzesmiths blacksmiths masons and carpenters contributed a lot in the building of temples
the weavers such as the saliyar or kaikkolars also donated to temples
hampi was the capital of the vijayanagara empire
the architecture of hampi was distinctive
it bustled with commercial and cultural activities during the -th centuries
moors chettis and agents of european traders thronged the markets of hampi
temples were the hub of cultural activities

the kathiawad seths or mahajans had huge banking houses at surat
the surat hundis were honoured in the far-off markets of cairo in egypt basra in iraq and antworp in belgium
surat began to decline towards the end of the th century
the town of masculipatnam was a centre of intense activity in the th century
as it became the most important port on the andhra coast both the dutch and english east india companies attempted to control it
the qutb shahi rulers of golconda decided to prevent the attempts of the various east india companies
as a result fierce competition among various trading groups made the city populous and prosperous
however golconda was annexed by aurangzeb in -
this caused the european companies to look for the alternatives
the company traders moved to bombay calcutta and madras
this caused the decline of masulipatnam in the th century
the english emerged as the most successful commercial and political power in the subcontinent
indian textiles were in great demand in europe and west asia
more and more people began to engage themselves in the crafts of spinning weaving bleaching dying etc
but the craftspersons were no more independent
they now began to work on a system of advances which meant that they had to weave cloth which was already promised to european agents
bombay calcutta and madras became important cities in the th century
the europeans established black towns in these new cities and merchants and artisans were made to move there
administrative town a town from where the administration is carried on

the indian society was divided on the basis varnas
during the medieval period gap between the rich and poor increased
there were however several communities which did not follow rules laid down by the brahmins
these included the tribes nomads and settled communities
tribal societies  tribes are people who do not follow norms laid down by society
 most of the tribes were dependant on agriculture
others were herders or hunter- gatherers
 tribes were even nomadic and moved from one place to another
 many tribes lived in forests hills deserts and other places which were difficult to reach
they preserved their culture and heritage through oral tradition
 there were even clashes between tribes and powerful caste-based societies
 contemporary historians and travellers from medieval india hardly give any information about the tribes
 many of the tribes emerged as politically powerful groups through their areas of influence and activities varied
 some of the powerful tribes were khokhar tribe in punjab langahs and arghuns in multan gaddis in the himalayas  kolis and berads of gujarat gonds of chhattisgarh bhil tribe in central india etc
 the tribal societies underwent a change as a result of interaction with the hindu and islamic societies
pastoral nomads  the pastoral nomads moved from one place to another with their herd of animals
 they survived on milk products and exchanged ghee wool etc
with farmers for grains cloth utensils etc
 the most important trader nomads were banjaras
their caravan was called ‘tanda’
sultan alauddin khilji used banjaras to move grain to the city markets
 pastoral tribes thus basically reared and sold animals like horses and cattle to the prosperous people
changes in caste structure of india  in the fields of trade and agriculture there emerged a multi-caste population in many villages on account of the spread of islam
 inter-caste marriages started between rajputs and muslim nobles
 with the growth of the economy new jatis and varnas emerged
 many tribes became part of rule changes
the gonds  gonds were sometimes referred to by their tribal dialect gondi
 the gonds rose when delhi sultanate declined
 the gond kingdom gondwana in southeastern madhya pradesh was founded in the th century
ahoms  the ahom tribe is traced to some tribes living in south-east asia who had travelled overland through the forests of assam
 the religion and culture of assam is a fusion of the local traditions and of migrant tribes
 the ahoms belonged to a warrior class and built roads and irrigation system even before establishing their rule
 the ahoms formed the new kingdom by suppressing the older political system of bhuiyans
tribal societies were absolutely different from those which existed in big cities
tribal societies did not follow the social rules and rituals prescribed by the brahmanas because they divided societies into numerous unequal classes
these societies were known as tribes
there was a unique bond of kinship among the members of each tribe
their main source of livelihood was agriculture
however hunter-gatherers or herders were also there
some tribes were nomadic and kept on moving from one place to another
a tribal group controlled land and pastures jointly and divided these amongst households as per its own rules
many large tribes lived in forests hills deserts and places difficult to reach
tribal people did not keep written records
but they preserved rich customs and oral traditions which help historians to collect knowledge about them
some powerful tribes controlled large territories
in punjab the khokhar tribe was very influential during the th and th centuries
later the gakkhars became more important
in multan and sind the languages and arghuns dominated extensive regions
the balochis were found in the north-west
the shepherd tribe of gaddis lived in the western himalayas
the north-eastern part of the subcontinent was dominated by the nagas ahoms and many others
the mundas and santals were important tribes found in bihar jharkhand orissa and bengal
the kolis were found in maharashtra karnataka and gujarat
the bhils were spread across western and central india
the gonds lived in chhattisgarh madhya pradesh maharashtra and andhra pradesh
nomadic pastoralists lived on milk and other pastoral products
the banjaras were the most important trader-nomads
smaller castes or jatis emerged with the growth of society
smiths carpenters and masons were recognised as separate jatis
among the kshatriyas new rajput clans became powerful by the th and th centuries
they belonged to different lineages such as hunas chandelas chalukyas etc
some of these had been tribes earlier
many of these clans came to be regarded as rajputs
the rise of rajput clans to the position of rulers set an example for the tribal people to follow
the gonds lived in a vast forested region known as gondwana
the large gond tribe was further divided into many smaller clans
each clan had its own raja or rai
about the time that the power of the delhi sultans was declining a few large gond kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller gond chiefs
the akbar nama mentions the gond kingdom of garha katanga
garha katanga was a rich state
however it was defeated by the mughals
despite that the gond kingdoms survived for some time
they created a new state by suppressing the older political system of the bhuiyans landlords
during the th century they annexed the kingdoms of the chhutiyas and of koch-hajo and subjugated many other tribes
thus they built a large state
however they faced many invasions from the south-west and finally they were defeated by the mughals
ahom society was divided into clans or khels
the society was very sophisticated
the ahoms worshipped their own tribal gods
however in the reign of sib singh hinduism became the predominant religion
but the ahom kings did not completely give up their traditional beliefs
clan a clan is a group of families or households claiming descent from a common ancestor
nomads people who keep on moving from one place to another
nomadic pastoralists people who move over long distances with their animals
tanda the caravan of the banjaras was called tanda
itinerant group this group consists of craftspersons peddlers and entertainers who travel from place to place practising their different occupations
shifting cultivation trees and bushes in a forest area are first cut and burnt
the crop is then sown in the ashes
after some time when this land loses its fertility another patch of land is cleared and planted in the same manner
 – cheros were defeated
 – the ahoms annexed the kingdoms of the chaityas
 – the ahoms annexed the kingdoms of koch-hajo
 – the mughals under mir jumla attacked the ahonri kingdom
- – sib singh reigned in the ahom kingdom
devotion to god without discrimination on the basis of caste was taught by the bhakti and sufi saints
both sufism and bhakti movements had several common traits and spread as popular movements at about the same time
the idea of a supreme god  before large kingdoms emerged different groups of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses
as people were brought together through the growth of towns trade and empires new ideas began to develop
 the idea that all human beings are not equal at birth gained ground during this period
 the idea of a supreme god who could deliver humans from bondage through devotion or bhakti emerged
 gods and goddesses worshipped in different areas came to be identified with shiva vishnu or durga
a new kind of bhakti in south india – nayanars and alvars  the seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of a new religious movement led by nayanars saints devoted to shiva and alvars saints devoted to vishnu
 they were sharply critical of the buddhists and jainas and preached ardent love of shiva or vishnu as the path to salvation
 the nayanars and alvars went from place to place composing exquisite poems of praise of the deities enshrined in the village they visited and set them to music
 the chola and pandya kings built elaborate temples around many of the shrines
philosophy and bhakti  shankara a philosopher of kerala advocated advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the supreme god which is the ultimate reality
 ramanuja of tamil nadu advocated that the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to vishnu
basavanna’s virashaivism  virashaivism movement was initiated by basavanna and his companions allama prabhu and akkamahadevi in karnataka in the mid- century
 they argued strongly for equality of all human beings opposed brahmanical ideas on caste and treatment of women
 some of these belonged to lower castes
they rejected all forms of ritualism outward display of piety and social differences based on birth
nathpanthis siddhas and yogis  a number of religious groups that emerged during this period criticized the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order using simple logical arguments
 among them were the nathpanthis siddhcharas and yogis
islam and sufism  islam propagated monotheism or submission to one god
‘  it also rejected idol worship
muslim scholars developed a holy law called shariat
 the sufis rejected the elaborate codes of behaviour demanded by muslim religious scholars
 the sought unison with god as a lover seeks his beloved with a disregard for the world
 among the great sufis of central asia were ghazzali rumi and sadi
 sufism introduced many popular orders or silsilas of which the most widespread was the shariat and chisti silsilas
 the chisti silsila was among the most influential orders
a long line of teachers included khwaja moinuddin chisti of  ajmer qutbuddin bakhtiyar kaki of delhi baba farid of punjab khwaja nizamuddin auliya of delhi and bandanawaz gisudaraz of gulbarga
new religious developments in north india  the period after the th century saw a new wave of bhakti movement in north india
 this wave was led by scholars like tulsidas surdas kabir and baba guru nanak  this tradition also included saints like dadu dayal ravidas and mirabai
mirabai was devoted to lord krishna
 a unique feature of most of these saints is that their works were composed in regional languages and could be sung
 kabir ridiculed idol worship and believed in one formless supreme god with devotion as the path of salvation
 guru nanak emphasized on the importance of one god and nam-japna kirti-kama and vand- chhakna
the number of  baba guru nanak’s followers increased through the th century under his successors
 shankara was an advocate of advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the supreme god
various kinds of bhakti and sufi movements evolved since the eighth century
several people also showed their interest in the teachings of the buddha or the jainas
others felt attracted to the idea of a supreme god
such people sought the path of bhakti to approach this supreme god
as a result shiva vishnu and durga came to be recognised as supreme deities
people began to worship them through elaborate rituals
the seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of new religious movements led by the nayanars saints devoted to shiva and alvars saints devoted to vishnu who came from all castes including untouchables
they criticised the buddhists and jainas and preached ardent love of shiva or vishnu as the path of salvation
elaborate temples were built by the chola and pandya kings between the tenth and twelfth centuries
thus the bhakti tradition got strongly linked with temple worship
shankara a bhakti saint was an advocate of advaita or the doctrine of the oneness of the individual soul and the supreme god which is the ultimate reality
he preached renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of knowledge
ramanuja another bhakti saint was deeply influenced by the alvars
according to him the best means of attaining salvation was through intense devotion to vishnu
virashaiva movement was initiated by basavanna and his companions
this movement began in karnataka in the mid-twelfth century
the virashaivas were against all forms of ritual and idol worship
the saint-poets of maharashtra such as janeshwar namdev eknath and tukaram inspired people through their songs in simple marathi
these saints rejected all forms of ritualism outward display of piety and social differences based on birth
they also rejected the idea of renunciation and preferred to live with their families
several other religious groups such as nathpanthis siddhas and yogis also criticised the ritual and other aspects of conventional religion and the social order
they advocated renunciation of the world
they inspired people to lay in meditation on the formless ultimate reality and the realisation of oneness with it
they gave importance to yogasanas
they rejected outward religiosity and emphasized love and devotion to god and comparison towards all fellow human beings
the sufis rejected the elaborate rituals and codes of behaviour demanded by muslim religious scholars
the sufis too composed poems like the saint-poets
some of the great sufis were ghazzali rumi and sadi
the sufi saints developed elaborate methods of training using zikr chanting of a name or sacred formula contemplation sama singing rags dancing discussion of parables breath control etc
under the guidance of a master or pir
thus emerged the silsilas a genealogy of sufi teachers
the chishti silsila is worth-mentioning in this regard
the sufi teachers held their assemblies in their khanqahs or hospices houses of rest for travellers
here they discussed spiritual matters
sufi shrines are visited by devotes of all backgrounds
a new wave of bhakti movement began in north india after the th century
this was an age when islam brahmanical hinduism sufism various strands of bhakti and the nathpanths siddhas and yogis influenced one another
kabir and baba guru nanak rejected all orthodox religions
others like tulsidas and surdas accepted existing beliefs and practices but wanted to make these accessible to all
tulsidas’s composition the ramcharitmanas written in awadhi is important both as an expression of his devotion and as a literary work
surdas was an ardent devotee of krishna
dadu dayal ravidas and mirabai were some other important saints of this tradition
the works of these saints were composed in regional languages and therefore they became very popular
we come to know about kabir through his sakhis and pads kabir’s teachings were based on complete rejection of the major religious traditions
he believed in a formless supreme god and preached that the only path to salvation was through bhakti or devotion
guru nanak emphasised the importance of the worship of one god
he insisted that caste creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining liberation
he used the terms nam dan and isnan for the essence of his teachings which actually meant right worship welfare of others and purity of conduct
words that matter virashaivism it was popular in karnataka during the mid-twelfth century
its followers argued strongly for the equality of all human beings and against brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of women
vilthala a form of vishnu

it is quite common for us to identify a region with its language
every region is identified with a certain distinct type of food clothing poetry dance painting and music
the chera empire of mahodayapuram which was established in th century in the southwestern part of kerala introduced the malayalam language
rulers and religious traditions the jagannatha cult  in several regions regional cultures developed around religious traditions
 the local people made a wooden image of the deity which originally a local god came to be identified with vishnu
 temple became the centre of pilgrimage
the rajputs and traditions of heroism  in the th century the rajasthan of today was called rajputana by the british
 there are many groups who call themselves rajputs in northern and central india
 prithviraj chauhan was one such ruler
 women had been given a heroic image since they committed sati or self-immolation
beyond regional frontiers the story of kathak  the heroic traditions of various regions also helped in the evolution of dance in several regions
 one such dance was kathak which was evolved in northern india
the kathaks initially were a caste of story-tellers in north indian temples
 the legends of radha-krishna were enacted in folk plays known as rasalila
 it integrated folk dance with the basic gestures of the kathak story-tellers
 music also developed into various forms like qawwali and khayal and new instruments like sitar were invented
paintings for patrons the traditions of miniatures  during this period one more tradition which deserves our attention is the miniature painting
miniatures are small sized paintings done in watercolour on cloth or paper
 akbar jahangir and shah jahan hired highly skilled painters to illustrate their manuscripts in the kitab khana containing their accounts and poetry
 when the mughal empire started declining new artistic tastes developed in the regional court of deccan and rajput rulers
 one of the most popular paintings of the himalayas region was bhanudatta’s rasamanjari
 the kangra artists by mid-th century infused a new life into miniature painting
the growth of a regional language bengal  regional language is the language which a person speaks in a region
 it is generally assumed that the bengali language is spoken by people of bengal
 bengali originated from sanskrit but later on developed its own identity and literature
 early bengali literature may be divided into two categories—the first includes translations from sanskrit epics and the  the second includes nath literature
pirs and temples  from the th century people migrated in large numbers from less fertile western bengal to the forested and marshy of south-eastern bengal
 with mughal control over bengal the capital shifted to dhaka
 the early settlers got help from teachers called pirs
they included saints or sufis and prominent religious personalities
regional cultures today are often the product of complex processes of intermixing of local traditions with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent
the chera kingdom of mahodayapuram was established in the ninth century in the south- western part of the peninsula part of present-day kerala
the rulers introduced the malayalam language and script in their inscriptions
the cheras also drew upon sanskritic traditions
the temple theatre of kerala borrowed stories from the sanskrit epics
in other regions regional cultures grew around religious traditions
the best example of this process is the cult of jagannath at puri orissa
the word jagannath literarily means the lord of the world a name for vishnu
anantavarman the ruler of the ganga dynasty in the th century built a temple for purushottama jagannatha at puri
the rajputs contributed a lot to the distinctive culture of rajasthan
from about the eighth century most of the present-day state of rajasthan was ruled by various rajput families
prithviraj was one such ruler
rajput rulers cherished the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly often choosing death on the battlefield rather than face defeat
women were also focused on these stories
they are depicted as following their heroic husbands in both life and death
they often chose to become sati on the funeral pyre of their husbands
not only heroic traditions are found in different regions in different forms but dance too
just take the history of one dance form kathak
the term kathak is derived from katha a word used in sanskrit and other languages for a story
the kathaks was originally a caste of story-tellers in temples of north india who beautified their performances with gestures and songs
kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of dance in the th and th centuries
under the mughals it developed in two traditions or gharanas—one in the courts of rajasthan jaipur and the other in lucknow
slowly and steadily it took root in punjab haryana jammu and kashmir etc
kathak was recognised as one of six classical forms of dance in the country after independence
other classical dances are—bharatnatyam tamil nadu kathakali kerala odissi orissa kuchipudi andhra pradesh and manipuri manipur
the tradition of miniature painting is also noteworthy
miniatures are small-sized paintings generally done in watercolour on cloth or paper
the earliest miniatures were on palm leaves or wood
the mughal emperors patronised highly skilled painters
with the decline of the mughal empire many painters moved out to the courts of the emerging regional states
by the late th century a bold and intense style of miniature painting called basohli got developed in the himalayan foothills around the modern-day state of himachal pradesh
here the mughal artists founded the kangra school of painting
soft colours including cool blues and greens and lyrical treatment of themes distinguished kangra painting
now we will see how bengali a regional language grew in the course of time
from the eighth century bengal became the centre of a regional kingdom under the palas
between the th and th centuries bengal was ruled by sultans
in  akbar conquered bengal while persian was the language of administration bengali developed as a regional language
early bengali literature may be divided into two categories
the fist includes translations of the sanskrit epics the mangala kavyas and bhakti literature such as biographies of chaitanyadeva the second includes nath literature such as songs of maynamati and gopichand stories concerning the worship of dharma thakur and fairy tales folk tales and ballads
the cult of ptr a spiritual guide became popular in bengal and their shrines can be found there
a number of temples got constructed in bengal
now local deities began to be worshipped in temples
bengal being in a riverine plain produces abundant rice and fish
these two items are important foods of the bengalis
the bengal brahmanas too eat fish
fishing has been a major occupation of the bengalis
bengali literature contains several references to fish
lilatilakam a fourteenth-century text of sanskrit that deals with grammar and poetics
rajputana the region that constitutes most of present-day rajasthan was called rajputana by the british during the th century
sati the immolation of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands
kathak the term is derived from katha a word used in sanskrit and other languages for the story

congress had made its reach to major towns and cities and swadeshi movement greatly broadened national movements appeal among middle classes
 gandhiji’s first major public appearance in india was at opening of banaras hindu university bhu in 
during his speech gandhiji charged the indian elite with a lack of concern for the labouring poor sections of our society
 gandhiji said “there can be no spirit of self-government if we take away or allow other to ’ take away from the peasant almost the whole result of their labour
”  gandhiji’s speech at one level was a statement of the fact that indian nationalism was an elite phenomenon in which lawyers doctors and landlords were mostly involved
but he wanted that indian national movement should represent indian people as a whole
movement transcended from elite to peasants working class and encompassed every section of society

through this movement he wanted to seek security of the peasants and their freedom to cultivate crop of their choice
in  he led a strike demanding for better working conditions for the textile mill workers in ahmedabad and other peasant movement asking the state for the remission of taxes in kheda
during the first world war - the british government instituted censorship of the  press and permitted detention without trial
at the recommendation of rowlatt committee these policies were continued
so in response to it gandhiji called for nationwide campaign against rowlatt act and bandh were observed
in april  repressive policy took very ugly and tremendous turn when british brigadier dyer ordered his troops to fire on peaceful assembly at jallianwalah bagh in amritsar
in this incident more than  people died
this shocked the nation and very deep resentment and anger was brewing inside indians
 it was the rowlatt satyagraha that made gandhiji a true national leader
emboldened by its success gandhji called for campaign of non- cooperation with british rule
indians were asked to renunciate all voluntary associations with british government
gandhiji believed if non- cooperation was carried effectively british would leave the country within a year
khilafat and non-cooperation movement  to further strengthen the movement and unity among fellow indians he joined hand with khilafat movement
khilafat movement was led by mohammad ali and shaukat ali and it demanded restoration of the respect of the caliphate

hindus and muslims could collectively bring an end to colonial rule
 students refused to go to schools colleges lawyers stopped to going courts working class went on strike tribes in andhra pradesh violated forest laws and farmers in awadh stopped paying taxes

it was negative enough to be peaceful but positive enough to be effective
it entailed denial renunciation and self-discipline
it w’as training for self- rule
” due to this movement british government was shaken

he reached to shore and made a salt and thereby making himself criminal in sight of law
many parallel salt marches were undertook during this time in other parts of the country

lawyer boycotted the courts peasants stopped paying taxes and tribal broke forest laws
there were strikes in factories or mills
 the government responded by detaining the dissenters or satvagrahis
 indians were arrested and various high rank leaders of congress including gandhiji were arrested
 an american magazine ‘time’ was initially doubtful on the strength of gandhiji and wrote that salt march would not be successful
but latter it wrote that this march made the british rulers ‘desperately anxious’
 these rulers were now started considering gandhiji as a ‘saint’ and ‘statesman’ who was using christian acts as a weapon against men with christian beliefs
significance of dandi march  davdi march was very significant for at least three reasons  it brought mahatma gandhi and india to attention of the world
kamladevi chattopadhyay a socialist leader persuaded gandhi not to restrict movement to men alone
many women including kamladevi broke salt and liquor laws and courted arrest
 third and most significant was that this movement forced the british to realise that their raj would not last forever and they need to devolve some power to indians
 in january  gandhiji was released from jail and afterwards many meetings between gandhi and irwin took place and these meetings ended in a gandhi-irwin pact
through this pact civil disobedience movement would be called off political prisoner will be released and salt manufacturers can make salt near coast
this pact was criticised by radical nationalist as gandhiji was unable to obtain commitment of political independence for indians
 in later part of  gandhiji went to attend second round table conference as representative of congress and he said his party represent all of india but his claim was countered by muslim league princely states and br  so this conference remained inconclusive

now whole struggle became complicated and took a shape of three way struggle between british congress and muslim league
however talks broke down when congress offered it will help the british to defend india from axis powers
then the viceroy had to appoint an indian as the defence member of his executive council
quit india movement  after the failure of cripps mission gandhiji started quit india movement in august  from bombay
during this time as congress leaders were in jail jinnah and other muslim league leaders worked patiently to extend its influence in punjab and sind where it had scarcely any presence

finally on th august  power was transferred to india
the last heroic days of mahatma gandhi  gandhiji marked the day of independence with a  hour fast
the freedom struggle ended with division of country and hindus and muslims seeking each others life
 in the months of september and october gandhiji went around hospitals and refugee camps giving consolation to people

it further said party had never accepted partition but it has been forced on it
 congress said india will be a democratic secular country every citizen will be equal
congress tried to assure the minorities in india that their rights will be protected in india
he believed that worst is over
he allowed himself to hope that though geographically and politically india is divided into two at heart we shall ever be friends and brothers helping and respecting one another and be one for the outside world
 gandhiji was shot dead by a hindu extremist nathuram godse
nathuram godse was an editor of hindu extremist newspaper who had denounced gandhiji as an appeaser of muslims
time magazine compared his death to abraham lincoln
knowing mahatma gandhi  there are different sources from which history of the national movement and the political career of gandhiji can be reconstructed
 writing and speeches of mahatma gandhi and his contemporaries were important source for knowing the events
though there is a difference speech were meant for public while private letter were meant to express emotions and thinking that cannot be expressed publicly

 but soon they felt that due to their behavior hindus grew stronger so they reversed their policy
 now they began to take side with the muslims and turned against hindus
 bengal was partitioned in  by lord curzen
he said bengal was partitioned due to administrative problems
 the real objective of british behind the partition of bengal was to sow the seed of disunity between the hindus and the muslims
 by the act of  british government gave the muslims the right of separate electorate
 in  lucknow pact was signed between congress and the muslim league
it was an important landmark step forward in achieving hindu- muslim unity

he proposed his plan on  june  in which he stated that country would be divided into two dominions i
it was accepted by both congress and muslim league
the joy of independence from colonial rule was tarnished by the partition and violence which was unleashed after the partition
some of the incidents and facts about partition  and its disturbing experiences can be known by interviews books and other related documents
 partition caused at very large scale violence thousands of people were killed innumerable women were raped and abducted
there was large scale displacement of people across the border millions were uprooted and transformed into refugees
in all approximately  million had to move across the newly created borders
 displaced people lost their all immovable property and most of their movable property separated from their relatives and friends as well
people were stripped of their local culture and were forced to begin life from scratch
 speaking of these killings arson rape and loot that came along with partition observers and scholars have sometimes used the expression ‘holocaust’ with primary meaning of destruction or slaughter on a mass scale
historical background of partition  there are several events which gave fuel to fire for partition of india and pakistan whether directly or indirectly
 politicisation of religion started with separate electorate in 
it was further strengthened by colonial government of india in 
 community identities no longer indicated simple difference in faith and belief they became mean to active opposition and hostility between communities
 communal identities were further consolidated during s and s by music before rnasjid by cow protection movement and shuddhi movement of arya samaj
 middle class publicist and communal activist sought to build greater solidarity within their communities and mobilising people against other community
every communal riot deepened the difference between communities
in this election congress won majority in  provinces and formed government in  provinces out of 
 congress fared badly in reserved constituencies even muslim league performed poorly and captured only few seats of reserved categories
in united province muslim league wanted to form government with congress but congress rejected it as they had absolute majority
this rejection led to believe by leagues member that they would not get political power as they are minority
league also believed that only muslim party can represent muslims and congress is a hindu party
 in ’s league’s social support was fairly small and weak so league started working enthusiastically to expand its social support in all the muslim dominated areas
 congress and its ministries failed in countering the hatred and suspicion spreaded by league
congress failed in winning over the muslim masses
 growth of rss and hindu mahasabha also played an important role in widening the difference between hindus and muslims
the ‘pakistan’ resolution  on rd march  league passed a resolution demanding a measure of autonomy for muslim majority areas of the sub-continent
this resolution never mentioned partition or a separate state
he also not imagined a separate country at the time of his speech
the sudden demand of partition  none of the leaders of muslim league were clear about pakistan
 demand for autonomous area was made in  and within  years only partition took place
 even jinnah in the beginning may have seen the pakistan as bargaining tool for preventing british to grant concession to congress and to gain favours for muslims
 in  again provincial elections were held
in this election congress swept general constituencies and league succeed in gaining large majority of muslim vote
 the league’s success to capture seats reserved for muslims was spectacular
it won all  reserved constituencies in the centre and  out of  seats in the provinces
therefore in  league established itself as dominant party among muslims
cabinet mission came to india  in march  cabinet mission came to india to make a suitable political framework for india
 mission recommended india to be united with three tier confederation
it grouped provincial assemblies into  sections
a for hindu majority province while b and c were for muslim majority areas of north-west and north-east
cabinet mission proposed a weak centre and provinces will have power to set up intermediate level executives and legislature of their own
 initially all parties agreed but later league demanded that grouping should be made compulsory and should have right to secede from the union
while congress wanted that provinces should be given the right to join the group
so due to differences talks broke down
 now congress sensed after this failure that partition became inevitable and took it as tragic but unavoidable
but mahatma gandhi and khan abdul ghaffar khan of north-west frontier province continued to oppose the idea of partition
re-election in the year   after withdrawal from cabinet mission muslims league decided on direct action for winning its pakistan demand
it announced th august  as ‘direct action day’
initially riots broke out in calcutta and gradually spread to other parts of northern india
 in march  congress accepted division of punjab in  halves one will be muslim majority and other will be hindusikh majority
similarly bengal was a ho divided
governance structure of the country was totally collapsed there was complete loss of authority
british officials were reluctant to take decisions and did not know how to handle the situation
british were busy preparing to quit india
 top leaders barring gandhiji were engaged in negotiation regarding independence
indian civil servants in the affected areas were concerned for their own life
condition of women during the partition  during the partition women suffered the most
women were raped abducted sold and forced to settle down to a new life with stranger in unknown circumstances
some began to develop a new family bond in their changed circumstances
 government of both india and pakistan showed lack of understanding of emotions and sometimes forcefully sent women away from their new relatives
they did not consult the concerned women and undermine their rights to take decisions
 notion of honour drew on a conception of masculinity defined as ownership of zan women and zamin land
virility it was believed that lay in ability to protect your possession i
zan and zamin from outsiders
 so when men feared that their women-wives daughters sisters would be violated by enemy they killed their women themselves
there was an incident in village of rawalpindi where  sikh women voluntarily jumped into w’ell for protecting themselves from outsiders
 these incidents were seen as ‘martyrdom and it is believed that men at that time had to courageously accept the decision of women and in some cases even persuade them to kill themselves
role of mahatma gandhi during partition  using turmoil gandhiji took brave effort to restore peace toured villages of noakhali east bengal villages in bihar then riots torn calcutta and delhi to stop communal killing and reassure the safety of minority community
 in east bengal he assured safety of hindus while in delhi he told hindus and sikhs to protect muslims and tried to build a spirit of mutual trust
many hindus sikh migrants fasten with him
the effect of the fast was ‘electric’ as people started to realise the misdeed what they have done with other communities
but only with martyrdom of gandhiji finally this massacre ended
regional variations in partition  the partition brought carnage and thousand of lives were lost
 in punjab there was a mass displacement of hindu and sikh population from pakistani side to indian side and displacement of punjabi muslims to pakistan from indian side
 displacement of people in punjab was very agonising
property were looted women were killed abducted and raped
there was large scale massacre
 in bengal people moved across porous border suffering was less concentrated and agonising in bengal in comparison to punjab
there was also not total displacement of hindu and muslim population in bengal
 some muslims families of uttar pradesh bihar madhya pradesh and hyderabad also migrated to pakistan during s and early ’s
 jinnah’s theory of two state based on religion failed when east bengal separated it from west pakistan and become independent country as bangladesh in 
 in punjab and bengal there is huge similarity in both these states
women and girls were the prime target of persecution
attacker treated women bodies as territory to be conquered
 discoursing women of community was seen as dishonouring community
help humanity and harmony  there is history’ of help and humanity beneath the debris of violence and pain of partition
numerous stories are there when people took an extra effort to help the victims of partition
 many stories of caring sharing empathy are present stories of opening of new opportunities and of triumph over trauma are also present
the story of khushdeva singh a sikh doctor’s work is one of the finest examples who helped many migrants whether of muslim hindu or sikh communities with affection
he provided them shelter food security etc in times of partition
oral testimonies and history  oral narratives memoirs diaries family histories first hand written accounts helped in understanding the suffering of people during the time of partition
 lives of the affected people changed drastically between -

 the economic measure adopted by the british government made india a consumer of goods manufactured in england
 by the end of the th century when zamindars were facing a crisis a group of such peasants on other hand was consolidating their position in the villages
 with the emergence of the power of zamindars had considerably diminished
they did not surrender easily
so they devised many ways to withstand the pressure and keep their central focus on their zamindaris
 as a result of the british occupation of india the indian economy faced disastrous consequences
to fulfil their vested interests they shattered their tradition and structure of indian economy
 because of the decline of indian industry indian weavers and craftswoman were completely made jobless

 company fixed the revenue and each zamindar was supposed to pay
this fixing of revenue was done under the permanent settlement and it become operational from year 
 the zamindars who failed to pay the revenue their estate was auctioned to recover the revenue
but sometimes it was found that the purchasers at auction were servants and agents of the zamindar himself e
the problem of unpaid revenue  the british officials fell that agriculture trade and the revenue resources of the state could be developed by encouraging investment in agriculture
this could be done by securing rights of property and permanently fixing the rates of revenue demand
 company felt that when revenue will be fixed it will provide opportunity to individual to invest in agriculture as a means of making profit and company will also be assured of regular flow of revenue
 after a prolonged debate amongst company officials the permanent settlement was made with the rajas and taluqdars of bengal
 zamindars had several sometimes even  villages under them
 zamindars collected rent from the different villages paid the revenue to the company and retained the difference as his income
reasons for non-payment by zamindars  a number of reasons were responsible for non-repayment of revenue by zamindars which include that revenue demands were kept very high
it was imposed at a time when prices of agricultural produce was very low so peasants found it difficult to pay
 zamindars were also treated by strict laws i
the sunset law’ which was completely regardless of the harvest
according to this law zamindars had to pay revenue by sunset of the specified date otherwise zamindari was liable to be auctioned
sometimes ryots and village headman-jotedar deliberately delayed the payments
limitations imposed on zamindars by the company  zamindars were important for the company but it also wanted to control and regulate them subdue their authority and restrict their autonomy
 thus the zamindars’ troops were disbanded customs duties abolished and their ‘cutcheries’ courts brought under the supervision of a collector appointed by the company

the rise of the jotedars in villages  the group of prosperous farmers were popularly known as jotedars
jotedars were a class of rich peasants
 they acquired vast areas of land controlled trade money lending and exercise immense- power over the poorer cultivators
their land was cultivated through share cropper known as adhiyars or bargadars
 within village the power of jotedars was more effective than that of zamindars
they fiercely resisted the efforts of jama to increase the jama of village and prevented zamindari official from executing their duties
 sometimes they also purchased the auctioned property of zamindar
joiedar played an important role in weakening of zamindari system
the resistance of the zamindars  to prevent the weakening of their authority zamindar took series of steps-like fictitious sale or transferring of property to female- member of family manipulated the auctions withhelding revenue deliberately threating or intimidating the people outside their zamindari if they try to bought an estate
it was submitted to the british parliament in 
 british parliament forced the company to produce regular report on the administration of india and appointed committees to enquire into the affairs of the company
it became the basis of intense parliamentary debates on the nature of east india company’s rule in india
 fifth report has shaped our conception of what happened in rural bengal during that period and evidence contained in the th report are very important
the accounts of buchanan  francis buchanan undertook detailed surveys of the areas under the jurisdiction of the british east india company
 buchanan journey was sponsored by the company and it was planned according to its need
he had specific instruction about what he had to look for and what he had to record
 buchanan observed the stones rocks different layers of soil minerals and stones that were commercially valuable
 buchanan wrote about landscape and how these landscapes could be transformed and made productive
 his assessments were shaped by commercial interest of the company and modern western notions of what constituted progress
he was critical of lifestyle of forest dwellers
pastoral areas of bengal  with gradual passage of time settled cultivation expanded and reached to the area of shifting cultivation swallowing up pasture and forest in the rajmahal hills
shifting cultivation was done with the help of hoe while settled cultivation was done through plough
in the hills of rajmahal  francis buchanan a physician travelled through rajmahal hills and he gave an account about it
 originally in the rajmahal hills paharias lived
they lived on hunting shifting cultivation food gathering and was intimately connected to forest
as settled agriculture expanded the area under forest and pasture contracted
this sharpened the conflict between paharias and settled cultivators
 around  santhal came into these areas
they cleared the forest and ploughed land
 as the lower hills were takenover by the santhal settlers the paharias receded interior into the rajmahal hills
the santhals became settlers  zamindars and britishers after having failed to subdue the paharias and transform them into settled cultivators turned to santhals
the santhal appeared to be ideal settlers cleared the forest and ploughed land
 after land was granted population of santhals increased exponentially and their villages also increased in number
 when the santhal were settling the paharias resisted but were ultimately forced to withdraw deeper into hills
it impoverished the paharias in the long term
 santhals now lived a settled life cultivated a range of commerical crops for market and dealt with traders’moneylenders
but state was taxing them heavily moneylenders dikus were charging high interest rate and taking over their land when debts remained unpaid and zamindars were asserting control over their land
later due to problems santhal revolted in year - and to pacify them britishers carved out new areas for the santhals and imposed some special laws within it
the revolt in bombay deccan  one of the way to explore what was happening in the area of bombay deccan is to focus on the revolt of that area
rebels expressed their anger and fury
 revolt provide information about life of peasant event associated with revolt suppress or control of the revolt
enquiries about the revolt produced result that can be explored by historians
 through the nineteenth century peasants in various parts of india rose in revolt against money lenders and grain dealers e
the revolt occurred in  in the deccan
ryots burnt the khatas looted shop and in few instances burnt the house of sahukars
 later revolt spread from pune to ahmednagar and even further terrified sahukars fled the village leaving behind their property and belonging
 british officials controlled these revolts they established police post in villages and arrested people and convicted them
a new revenue system started  in the th century the british company was keen to expand its financial resources in its annexed territories through other temporary revenue settlement policies
 this was so because after  the agricultural prices rose and enlarged the income of the bengal zamindars but not the company
this was due to the permanent settlement policy in which the revenue demand was fixed and could not be hiked
therefore to expand its revenue source company started to introduce temporary settlement
 policies of officials were also shaped by the economic theories they are familiar with
in ’s officials were under influence of ricardian ideas
david ricardo was a celebrated economist in england
 ricardian idea states that landowner should claim only to average rent and when there is surplus state should tax that surplus
he further says if tax will not be levied cultivators will likely to turn into rentiers and surplus income will not be productively invested in improvement of land
 ryotwari settlement was introduced in bombay deccan as a new revenue system
in this system revenue was directly settled with cultivator or ryot
average income from soil revenue paying capacity of ryot was assessed and proportion of it was fixed as share of the state
in this system there was provision for resurvey of land every  years
revenue demand and peasant debt  revenue demand was very high and when harvest were poor it was impossible to pay when peasant failed to pay revenue his crops were seized and fine was imposed on the whole village
in ’s prices fell sharply famine struck and due to this lrd of cat tle in deccan were killed and half of human population died
so the problem became very severe but the unpaid revenue mounted
in these conditions many peasants deserted their village and migrated to new places
so they borrowed money from moneylender
but once loan was taken they were unable to pay it back
as debt mounted and loan remained unpaid peasant dependence on moneylender increased
 by ’s officials found that peasants were in alarming level of indebtness so they moderated the revenue demand slightly
by  agricultural price recovered steadily and peasants started expanding cultivation
but for the purpose of expansion they needed money to buy seeds etc so they again turned to moneylender for money
the experience of injustice of the peasants  peasants got deeper and deeper into debt and now they were utterly dependent on moneylender for survival but now moneylenders were refusing their loan
along with this there was customary rule that interest charged cannot be more than principal amount of loan
but in colonial rule this law was broken and now ryots started to see money lenders as devious and deceitful
 to tackle this problem british in  passed limitation law that stated that loan bond would have validity for  years only
 it was meant to check accumulation of interest
but moneylenders now forced ryot to sign a new bound every  years in which total unpaid balance of last loan was entered as principal amount and interest was charged on it
 in petitions to deccan riots commission ryots  stated how moneylenders were suppressing and oppressing them by refusing to give receipts when loan were paid back entered fictitious figures in bond and forced them to sign and put thumb impression on bonds or document about which they had no idea and they were not able to read
money lenders also acquired the harvest at low price and ultimately took over property of peasant
they have no choice because to survive they needed  loan but inoneylenders were not willing to give it without bonds
the commission held enquirers in district where riot spread recorded statements of ryots sahukars and eyewitnesses compiled data on revenue rate interest rate in different regions and collated reports sent by district collectors
report of commission was tabled in british parliament in 
 this report reflected the official thinking of colonial government
it came to one of the conclusion that peasants were angered by moneylenders not by revenue demand of the company
it shows that the colonial government was reluctant to admit that popular discontent was against the governments action
official reports are the invaluable source of reconstruction of history but they need to juxtaposed with other evidences also
cotton and its global condition  the american civil war broke in 
due to war cotton export to britain decreased very much
to reduce dependence on america cotton cultivation was promoted in india
 export merchants gave money to urban sahukars who in turn gave to rural moneylenders to secure the produce
so now the peasant had access to money easily and due to this cotton production increased rapidly
but this brought prosperity to rich peasants mostly and for small peasants it led to heavier debt
by  over  percent of cotton imports into britain were coming from india
 when in  civil war ended export of cotton resumed prices of cotton and demand of cotton from india decreased
thus merchants sahukars and moneylenders were not extending credit to peasants instead they demanded repayment of debts
at the same time revenue demand was also increased from  to  percent

their freedom was curtailed their armed forces were disbanded and their revenues and territories were taken away
 many ruling families such as rani lakshmibai of jhansi tried to negotiate with the company to protect their interest but they did not get success
 now the company began to plan to bring an end to the mughal dynasty
to make this plan successful the company took several measures
 the name of the mughal king was removed from the coins minted by the company
 in  it was announced that after the death of bahadur shah zafar the family of the king would be shifted out of the red fort and given another place in delhi to reside in
 in  the company decided that bahadur shah zafar would be the last mughal king and after his death his descendants would be called princes
 in the countryside peasants and zamindars resented the high taxes and the rigid methods of revenue collection
 the indian sepoys were unhappy about their pay allowances and condition of service
some of the company’s rules even violated their religious sentiments
thus everywhere there spread discontentment
 the responses to the reforms brought in the indian society by the british were also not positive although some reforms were essential
 the company passed laws to stop the practice of sati
 in  a new law was passed to make conversion to christianity easier
 some indians thought that the british were destroying their religion and their social customs while some wanted to change existing social practices
 by and by the people began to view the british as their common enemy and therefore they rose up against this enemy at the same time
 in may  a massive rebellion started that threatened the company’s very existence in india
 sepoy mutinied in several places beginning from meerut and a large number of people from different sections of society rose up in rebellion
 on  march  mangal pandey a young soldier was hanged to death for attacking his officers in barrackpore
this was too much for the sepoys
they refused to do the army drill using the new cartridges which were suspected of being coated with the fat of cows and pigs
thus tension grew between the company and sepoys
 the sepoys were determined to bring an end to the company’s rule
from meerut they rushed to delhi
 as the news of their arrival spread the regiments stationed in delhi also rose up in rebellion
they killed several british officers seized arms and ammunitions set buildings on fire
 they met the mughal emperor bahadur shah zafar and proclaimed him as their leader
 the mughal emperor got support from the rulers and chiefs of the country and together they rose against the british power
 after the british were routed from delhi there was no uprising for a few days
then a spurt of mutiny began
 regiment after regiment mutinied and took off to join other troops at nodal points like delhi kanpur and lucknow
after them the people of the towns and villages also rose up in rebellion and rallied around local leaders zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to fight the british
thus a widespread revolt shook the british confidence over ruling india
 the company had no way out except supressing the revolt with all its might
it brought reinforcement from england passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt
bahadur shah zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment
he along with his wife were sent to prison in rangoon
 but people in other areas still continued to resist and fought with the british
the british had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of mass rebellion
 the british had regained control of the country by the end of  but they could not carry on ruling the land with the same policies anymore
 the british parliament passed a new act in  and transferred the powers of the east india company to the british crown in order to ensure a more responsible management of indian affairs
 the governor-general of india was given the title of viceroy that is a personal representative of the crown
in this way the british government took direct responsibility for ruling india
 all ruling chiefs of the country were allowed to pass on their kingdoms to their heirs including adopted sons
however they were made to acknowledge the british queen as their sovereign paramount
revolt started with an outbreak of mutiny in meerut on th may 
after taking over the local administration sepoys alongwith people of surrounding village marched to delhi
they wanted the support of mughal emperor bahadur shah
sepoys came to red fort and demanded that the emperor give them his blessings
bahadur shah had no option but to support them
revolt of   sepoys’started revolt by capturing the arms from stores and plundering the treasury afterward they attacked and ransack all government offices like jail treasury- telegraph office record room bungalows etc
proclamations in hindi urdu and persian were put up calling local to join them and exterminate the foreign rule
when ordinary people joined sepoys mutiny changed to revolt the targets of attack widened
 during the revolt in towns like lucknow kanpur and bareilly the rich people and moneylenders were also attacked and property were looted as they were seen as allies of british and they also oppressed the peasants in the recent past
their emissaries moved from one station to other
 sepoys or historians have said panchayats were there and these were composed of native officers drawn from each regiments
some of the decisions were taken collectively by these panchayats
sepoys shared a common lifestyle and many of them came from the same caste so they sat together and made their own rebellion
for leadership rebels turned to those rulers to whom british has overthrown
most of these displaced rulers joined the revolt due to pressure of locals or due to their own zeal
 at some places religious leaders also took the leadership and inspired people to fight like fakir in meerut and religious leaders in lucknow who preached destruction of british rule
 local leader like shah mai in barout uttar pradesh and gonoo a tribal leader of kol tribals in singhbhum mobilised the communities for revolt
the role played by rumours and prophecies in revolt  rumours and prophecies played an important role in outbreak of mutiny and revolt
there was rumour about the cartridge of enfield rifle coated with fat of cow and pigs and mixing of bone dust with atta
 both these rumours were believed and it was thought that it would corrupt the religion and caste of both hindus and muslims
 there was a fear and suspicion that british wanted indians to convert them to christianity
 there was also prophecy in the air that british rule would come to an end on the centenary of battle of plassey on rd june 
so these rumours and prophecies provided important psychological reasons to revolt against the british rule
 reasons to believe in rumours  in the preceding years of f many things were introduced by british which were new to indian society and they w’ere believed to be aimed at reforming indian society like introduction of western education western ideas institutions schools colleges and universities
in s british annexed states like avvadh jhansi and satara by refusing adoption and on the basis of misgovernment
new’ land aws and revenue settlements were made
 these all above factors made indians believe that british is changing the way of their life custom rules and replacing them with alien customs and rule
 suspicion was further aggravated with rapid spread of christian missionaries and their activities
revolt in awadh  lord dalhousie describe the kingdom of awadh as a cherry that will drop into our mouth one day’
 lord wellesley introduced subsidiary alliance in awadh in 
gradually the british developed more interest in the kingdom of awadh
 the british were looking at role of awadh as producer of cotton and indigo and also as principal market of upper india
 by the ’s british conquered all major areas of india like the maratha lands the doab the carnatic the punjab and bengal
the annexation of awadh in  completed the territorial annexation which started a century earlier with the annexation of bengal
 dalhousie displaced nawab wazid ali shah and exiled to calcutta on plea that awadh is being misgoverned
 british government wrongly assume that nawab wazid ali was an unpopular ruler
on the contrary he w’as widely loved and people bemoaned for the loss of nawab
 the removal of nawab led to dissolution of courts and decline of culture
musicians dancers poets cooks retainers and administrative officials all lost their livelihood
british raj and the end of o war  with removal of nawab all taluqdar of the awadh were also disposed
they were disarmed and their forts were destroyed
with a new revenue system named summary settlement taluqdar lost their very large share of revenue  from land
this dispossession of taluqdar meant the complete break dowm of social order
 company directly settled revenue with peasants and revenue now was over assessed so peasants were troubled
 there was no longer any guarantee that in times of hardship or crop failure the revenue demand of the state would be reduced or the peasant would get the loan and support during festivals which they earlier used to get from taluqdar
 earlier british officials had friendly relations with indian sepoys but later indian sepoys were subjected to racial abuse low pay scale difference in service
 in s english officer developed a sense of superiority physical violence also started and distance between officers and sepoys grew
 as many indian serving in army were from awadh i
so local people of awadh were also aware of unfair behaviour meted out to their brothers
 peasants of awadh were already in trouble because of high revenue and taluqdar were looking for revenge to gain back their authority
 all these factors cumulatively led to intense participation of people of awadh in revolt of 
demands of rebels  during the revolt only few proclamations and ‘ishtahars’ notification were issued by rebel leader to propagate their ideas and persuade people to join the revolt
 so it is very difficult to reconstruct what happened in  and what were the demands of rebels
the only way to know in detail about revolt of  is by going through details of british officials and to know their point of view
 proclamation issued by rebel leader appealed to all sections of the population irrespective of cast and creed
the rebellion was seen as a war in which both hindus and muslims were equally to lose or gain
 it was remarkable that during uprising religious division between hindus and muslims was hardly noticeable despite the attempt of british government
there was a sense of fear and suspicion that british were determined to destroy the caste and religion of hindus and muslims and convert them to christianity
 proclamation were issued which urged people to come together to save their livelihood faith identity and completely reject the things associated with firangi raj
 during the revolt rebellion attacked all the symbols and office of british government
rebellion even targeted the allies of british government ransacked moneylenders property and burnt account books
 all the activities reflected an attempt of rebels to overturn traditional hierarchies and rebel against all oppression
the search of alternative power  rebels tried to establish pre-british world of th century during the revolt
 they tried to set up whole administrative machinery on one hand to carry out day to day activities during the war and on the other hand they tried to plan how to fight with british

 painting ‘in memoriam’ painted by joseph noel paton in  depicted the anxious moment in which women and children huddled in a circle looking helpless and innocent seemingly waiting for the inevitable dishonour violence and death
painting stirs up the imagination and seek to provoke anger and fury

there were innumerable pictures and cartoons in british press that sanctioned brutal repression and violent reprisal
 rebels were executed publicly blown from cannon or hanged from gallows
to instill a sense of fear among the people most of these punishments were given in public
 governor general canning declared that gesture of leniency and show of mercy would help in winning back the loyalty of sepoys

towns and cities in pre-colonial times  towns and cities before the advent of the british can be discussed under the following heads nature of towns  towns represent unique form of economic activities and cultures
in town ruler administrator artisans inansabdars and jagirdars traders etc were living
towns were surrounded by the fortified wall and thrived on the surplus and taxes derived from agriculture
 peasants from the countryside came to the town for pilgrimage or selling their produce during the lime of famine etc
there are also evidences of people going to village to sell their goods crafts etc
people migrated to villages when towns were attacked
 the presence of emperor nobels and other affluent powerful persons in town and centres meant that a wide variety of service had to be provided and these towns were seat of power from where administration of empire works
in the medieval times delhi agra lahore madurai and kanchipuram etc were famous towns and cities
changes in the th century  in the th century with decline of mughal empire old towns also lost their grandeur and new towns like lucknow hyderabad seringpatnam pune nagpur baroda tanjore etc were developed and these towns were seat of local authority
traders artisans administrators and mercenaries migrated from old mughal centres to these towns in search of work and patronage
many new qasbah small town in the country side and garij small fixed market came into existence but effect of political decentralisation were uneven puducherry
 european commercial companies had set up their base in different towns e
 portuguese in panji dutch in masulipatnam british in madras and french in pondicherry
forces of international trade mercantilism and capitalism defined the nature of society
 as british took over political control in india from  trade of east india company expanded and colonial port cities like bombay calcutta and madras emerged as economic and political power
development of town and cities in colonial times  a number of records and data were collected by the british as well as indian officials which provide information about the colonial cities
however according to historians the figures can be misleading some may have correct information and some may have ambiguity
colonial records of urban history  british government kept detailed records carried regular survey gathered statistical data and published official records of their trading activities to regulate their commercial affairs
british also started mapping as they believed maps help in understanding landscape topography planning development maintaining security and to gauge possibilities of commercial activities
 british government from late nineteenth century started giving responsibilities to elect indian representatives to administrate basic services to towns and it started a systematic annual collection of municipal taxes
 first all-india census was carried in  and after  it was carried decennial conducted every ten years
but the data record generated and kept by british government cannot be trusted blindly as it has ambiguities
people during that time gave evasive answers to officials due to suspicion and fear
 many times false information were given by the locals about mortality disease illness
always these were not reported
sometimes the reports and records kept by british government was also biased
however inspite of ambiguity and biasness these records and data helped in studying about colonial cities
trends of change  urban population of india remained stagnant during s
in the forty years between  and  the urban population increased from about  percent of the total population to about  percent
they were entry and exit points of goods from the country
smaller towns had little opportunity to grow
few towns which were situated on the bank of river like mirzapur which specialised in collecting cotton and cotton goods from deccan were growing but with introduction of railways its development stopped
 expansion of railway led to the formation of railway workshops and railway colonies
towns like jamalpur waltair and bareilly developed due to railways
towns a unique identity  colonial towns reflects a number of features these were important in terms of economic political and also cultural point of view which showed a unique identity
they also tell how power was shifted from indian rulers to the european elites
ports forts and centra for services  by th century madras calcutta bombay all had important ports and became the economic centre
 company built its factories and fortified these settlements for protection
 indian traders merchants artisans who worked with the european merchant lived outside these forts in their own settlement
settlement of european was called ‘white town’ and settlement of indians was known as ‘black town’
 expansion of railways connected the hinterland to these port cities
so it became convenient to transport raw material and labour to the cities
 in th century there was expansion of cotton and jute mills in region of bombay and calcutta
 there were only two proper industrial cities
kanpur which was specialised in leather woollen and textiles and second city was jamshedpur which was specialised in steel
however industrial development was lagging behind in india due to discriminatory policies of the british
a new urban milieu  colonial cities reflected the mercantile culture of english
political power and patronage shifted from indian rulers to the merchants of the east india company
 ghats and docks were developed
along the ports godowns mercantile office insurance agencies transport depots and banking developed
racially exclusive clubs racecourses and theatres were built for ruling elite
 european merchants and agents lived in palatial house in white town while indian  merchants middlemen agents had traditional courtyard houses in black town
 the labouring poor provided service to european and indian master as cook palanquin bearer coachmen guard porters and construction and dock worker
they lived in huts in different parts of the city
 after revolt the british felt the need that town needed to be more secure of and better defended
so pastureland and agricultural fields around older town were cleared and new urban space called civil lines were set up and white people used to live in it
cantonment were developed as safe enclaves and here indian troops lived under european command
 british considered black town as area characterised by chaos anarchy filth and disease
 when epidemics of cholera and plague spread they decided to take stringent measure for sanitation public health hygiene and cleanliness the development of hill stations  british government started developing hill stations initially because of need of british army
simla present day shimla founded during gurkha war -
anglo-maratha war led to development of mount abu 
darjeeling was taken from the ruler of sikkim in 
 the temperate and cool climate of hills were seen as sanitarium places where soldiers could be sent for rest and recovery from illness because these areas were free from diseases like cholera malaria etc
 hilly regions and stations became attractive place for european rulers and other elites
during summer season for recreation they visited these places regularly
many houses buildings and churches were designed according to european style
 later introduction of railway made these places more accessible and upper and middle class indians like maharajas lawyers and merchants also started visiting these places regularly
social life in the new cities  in cities life seemed always in a flux there was a great inequality between rich and poor
 new transport facilities like horse drawn carriage trains buses had been developed
people now started travelling from home to work place using the new mode of transportation
 many public places were created e
public parks theatres dubs and cinema halls in th century
these places provided entertainment and opportunity for social interaction
 people started migrating to cities

it provided women avenues to get out of their house and become more visible in public life
 they entered new profession as teacher theatre and film actress domestic worker factory worker etc
 middle class women started to express themselves through the medium of autobiographies journals and books
 conservatives feared these reforms they feared breaking existing rule of society and patriarchal order
 women who went out of the household had to face opposition and they became object of social censure in those years
 in cities there were a class of labourers or the working class
poor came to cities looking for opportunity few came to cities to live a new way of life and desire to see the new things
 life in cities were expensive jobs were uncertain and sometimes migrants leave their family at native place to save money
migrants also participated in the tamashas folk theatre and swangs satires and in that way they tried to integrate with the life of cities
british and french were engaged in battle in south india but with defeat of france in  madras became secure and started to grow as commercial centre
 officials were not permitted to marry indians
however other than english dutch portuguese were allowed to live in the fort as they were european and christian
 development of madras was done according to the need of whites
black town settlement of indians earlier it was outside the fort but later it was shifted
 new black town resembled traditional indian town with living quarter around temple and bazaar
there were caste specific neighbourhoods
 madras was developed by incorporating many nearby villages
city of madras provided numerous opportunities for local communities
 different communities perform their specific job in the madras city people of different communities started competing for british government job
 transport system gradually started to develop
urbanisation of madras meant areas between the villages were brought within the city
town planning in calcutta  town planning required preparation of a layout of entire urban space and urban land use
 city of calcutta had been developed from three villages called sutanati kolkata and govindpur
the company cleared a site of govindpur village for building a fort there
 town planning in calcutta gradually spread from fort william to other parts
lord wellesley played very important role in town planning of calcutta
further work of town planning was carried by lottery committee with the help of government
funds for town planning were raised by lotteries
 committee made a new map for calcutta made roads in the city and cleared riverbank of encroachment
many huts ‘bustis’ and poors were displaced to make calcutta cleaner and disease free and these people were shifted to outskirt of calcutta
thatched roof were banned and tiled roofs were made mandatory
 by the late nineteenth century official intervention in the city became more stringent
 british removed more huts and developed british portion of town at the expense of other areas
 these policies further deepened the racial divide of white town and black town and new division of healthy and unhealthy further rised
gradually public protest against these policies  strengthened anti-imperialistic feeling and nationalism among indians
 british wanted the cities like bombay calcutta and madras to represent the grandeur and authority of the british empire
town planning were aimed to represent their meticulous and rational planning and execution alongwith western aesthetic ideas
architecture in bombay  although government building primarily serving functional needs like defence administration and commerce but they often meant to showcase ideas of nationalism religious glory and power
 bombay has initially seven islands later it become commercial capital of colonial india and also a centre of international trade

 give them a symbol of superiority authority and power
 help in creating distinction between indian subjects and colonial masters
 for public building three broad architectural styles were used
these included neo-classical neo-gothic and indo-saracenic styles
building and architectural styles  architecture reflected the aesthetic idea prevalent at that time building also expressed vision of those who build them
architectural styles also mould taste popularise styles and shape the contours of culture
 from the late nineteenth century regional and national tastes were developed to counter colonial ideal

it is the oldest civilisation of india
 there is no consensus about the chronology of the harappan civilisation
 various scholars have given different dates about this period
 according to sir john marshall “this civilisation flourished between  and  bce”
 it was daya ram sahni who first discovered the sites of harappan in 
 the main centres of this civilisation are in pakistan
the same famous sites of this civilisation now in pakistan are mohenjodaro and chanhudaro
 the main centre where this civilisation flourished in india are kalibangan sangol pengplor lothal dholavira and banawali
 the urban planning of this civilisation was very magnificent
the houses were built in a systematic manner
roads were wide and cut each other at right angle
 the people of indus valley civilisation had also made best planning for the drainage of rainwater and dirty water
 the caste system was not present in the society
all the people lived together with mutual love and understanding
% the women held a high position or rank in the society
 they were fond of fashion
the economic life the people was very prosperous

both maternal and external trade was carried out
 the people worshipped many gods and goddesses
they worshipped mother goddesses lord shiva animal birds trees and the sun
 they knew arts and crafts
they knew the art of making beautiful sculptures toys pottery ornaments etc
they were skilled in the production of seals
 the languages used by them on the seals is still to be deciphered
if one is able to decipher their script inscribed on the seals it will throw a flood of the light on the various aspects of the harappan civilisation
 the main sources of our information of harappan civilisation is archaeological materials
the excavation carried out at indus sites tries to reconstruct the history of this civilisation
 during the excavation of indus sites many tools pottery seals household objects etc
 all these excavated materials are deeply examined by the archaeologists
 many historians like cunningham r
wheeler john marshall and g
 dates have played a valuable role in reconstructing the history of the ancient past including the indus valley civilisation sites
 many indian archaeologists like daya ram sahni s
thapar have played a great role in excavations of the indus sites
 indus valley civilisation is also known as bronze age civilisation because people used bronze extensively for making their pottery figure lines and ornaments
 almost  bce these were explicit signs about the decline of this civilisation
 by this time the two most important cities of indus valley-mohenjodaro and harappa had been completely declined
 around  bce this civilisation had completely vanished
epidemic aryan invasion change in the course of the river indus excessive floods earthquake etc
may be the main reasons for the decline of this civilisation
this civilisation is dated between bce  and  bce
it is the oldest civilisation of india
we know about the civilisation from archaeological evidences like houses pots ornaments tools and seals used by the people of that period
 there were also earlier and later cultures known as early harappan and late harappan civilisation
 cunningham was the first director general of archaeological survey of india who began archaeological excavations in the harappan sites
 cunningham was unable to find the significance of harappan civilisation and thought that indian history began with the first cities in the ganga valley
 daya ram sahni rakhal das baneiji john marshall were some of the important archaeologists associated with the discovery of harappan civilisation
the frontiers of the harappan civilisation have no connection with present day national boundaries
the major sites are now in pakistani territory
 in india a number of harappan settlements were found in punjab and haryana
the main centres where this civilisation flourished in india are kalibangan lothal dholavira rakhi garhi and banawali
 archaeologist tried to classify artefacts in terms of material and in terms of function by comparing these with present-day things
the problems of archaeological interpretation are most evident in attempts to reconstruct religious practices of the harappan
 unusual objects like terracotta figurines of women stone statuary of men motif of unicorn and figure in yogic posture on seals and structures like the great bath and fire altars may have had a religious significance
several reconstructions regarding the harappan civilisation remain speculative at present and there is a vast scope for future work
seals script weights of harappan civilisation  seals and sealings were used to facilitate long distance communication
if the bag of goods reached with its sealing intact it meant that it had not been tampered with
seals also conveyed the identity of the sender
 the harappan script remains undeciphered to date
the script was not alphabetical and had many signs between  and 
the lower denominations of weights were binary and the higher denominations followed the decimal system
food habits of harappan people  the people of harappan civilisation ate a wide range of plant and animal products including fish and meat wheat maize millet pulses rice and another eatables
for this cattle sheep goat buffalo and pig were domesticated by the harappans
agricultural techniques using by harappan people  archaeological evidences suggested that oxen were used for ploughing and two different crops were grown together
as most of the harappan sites are located in semi-arid lands it is evident that water from canals and wells was used for irrigation
social and economic differences among harappan people  archaeologists use certain strategies to find out social and economic differences among people
these include studying burials and artefacts which can be divided into utilitarian and luxuries
 valuable materials are generally concentrated in large settlements but rarely found in smaller settlements
craft production of harappan people  harappans knew the art of making beautiful sculptures toys pottery ornaments etc
chanhudaro was a tiny settlement exclusively devoted to craft production including bead-making shell-cutting metal-working seal-making and weight-making
 grinding polishing and drilling were done for making beads
nageshwar and balakot were specialised centres for making shell objects as both these settlements are near the coast
apart from smaller settlements larger cities like mohenjodaro and harappa were also the specialised centres for craft production
sometimes they established settlements where raw materials were available
another strategy for procuring raw materials may have been to send expeditions to areas where these were available e
khetri region for copper rajasthan and south india for gold
 the harappan made contact with distant lands like oman for procuring copper
the harappan seals weights dice and beads were found in other countries oman bahrain and mesopotamia
economic life and trade during harappan civilisation  economic life of the people was very prosperous the main occupations of the people were agriculture and domestication of animals
 trade was well developed
both internal and external trade were carried out
pictures of ships boats have also been found on seals which throw light on harappan contacts with far off places religious belief of harappan people  people of this civilisation worshipped many gods and goddesses
they worshipped lord shiva mother goddesses animals birds trees and the sun
caste system in harappan civilisation  the caste system was not present in the society
all people live together with mutual love and understanding
women held a high position or rank in the society
a planned town of harappan civilisation mohenjodaro  mohenjodaro was the most well-known urban site of the harappan civilisation
although harappa was the first site to be discovered it was badly destroyed by brick robbers
 the settlement in harappan civilisation was divided into two sections one smaller in terms of land but higher in terms of power known as the citadel the other much larger in terms of area but lower in terms of power was known as lower town
 all the harappan cities had carefully planned drainage system
the residential buildings at mohenjodaro were centred on a courtyard had its own bathrooms the drains of which were connected to the street drains
structures like warehouse and the great bath’ were used for public purposes
the end of harappan civilisation  by  bce most of the mature harappan sites were abandoned
around  bce this civilisation had completely vanished
after  bce a rural way of life what was known as ‘late harappan’ or ‘successor cultures’ emerged
 the reasons for the end of the civilisation range from climatic change deforestation excessive floods the shifting and drying up of rivers and to overuse of the landscape
all these factors may have weakened the civilisation but its ultimate extinction is more likely to have been completed by deliberate and large-scale destruction or by an invasion

  kalibangan was excavated by a
  sanghal was discovered by s
 vedas rigveda samveda yajurveda and atharveda and other religious and literary works are an invaluable source to know the history of that period
 in first century bce many changes took place regarding the last rites of the dead in the central and south india
in this period dead bodies were buried in graves and these graves were surrounded by big stone called as the megaliths
 in the th century bce sixteen big kingdoms known as mahajanapadas came into existence
 among these sixteen mahajanapadas were-magadha koshala vatsa and avant whichwere the most powerful
 in the th century bce the powerful mahajanapadas turned into powerful empires
 magadha was very powerful mahajanapada
there were several causes responsible for it
 chandragupta maurya was the founder of mauryan empire
he founded mauryan empire by defeating the last ruler of nanda dynasty mahajanapadas
 megasthenes’s indica and kautilya’s arthashastra provided valuable information about the mauryan empire
 after the death of chandragupta maurya’s his son bindusara became the next ruler who ruled from  to  bce
 after bindusara ashoka occupied the throne in  and ruled till  bce
 after the kalinga war ashoka gave up policy of war and expansion
these inscriptions are written in the brahmi prakrit script

this vast empire began to disintegrate at the end of the th century ce
development after the harappan civilization  after the decline of the harappan civilization several developments including the composition of rigveda took place in indian sub-continent
evidences of emergence of agricultural settlements pastoral communities and new modes of disposal of dead were found
 the most important development was from th century bce on wards when various empires and kingdoms emerged
in  james prinsep deciphered brahmi and kharosthi scripts used in earliest inscriptions and coins
 most of the inscriptions referred a king as piyadassi meant ‘pleasant to behold’ and a few inscriptions mentioned the king as asoka one of the most famous rulers known from buddhist texts
it gave a new direction to investigate into early indian political history economic and social developments
the earliest  states were known as mahajanapadas
in which vajji magadha koshala kuru panchala gandliara and avanti were most important
the mahajanapadas had a capital city which was often fortified
 brahmanas began composing dharmasutras from the th century bce onwards
magadha became the most powerful mahajanapada
bimbisara ajatashatru and mahapadma nanda were the most ambitious kings of magadha
magadha had its capital in rajagaha rajgir which was fortified and later the capital shifted to pataliputra patna
mauryan empire  development of magadha resulted in the emergence of the mauryan empire founded by chandragupta maurya in  bce
besides sculptures historians have used a variety of sources like written texts of megasthenes kautilya arthashastra buddhist jaina and puranic literature inscriptions of asoka to reconstruct the history of mauryan empire
 pataliputra taxila ujjayini tosali suvarnagiri were the five major political centres of mauryan empire
 the vast empire was not controlled by a uniform administrative system
asoka tried to hold his vast empire together by propagating dharma
he appointed special officers known as the dhamma mahamatta to spread the message of dhamma
asokan inscription  in deciphering brahmi the european scholars and indian scholars compared devanagari and bengali scripts with brahmi script
after painstaking work james prinsep was able to decipher asokan brahmi in 
 kharosthi was deciphered by studying coins which had both greek and kharosthi scripts
asoka was mentioned in the inscriptions as ‘devanampiya’ meant ‘beloved of the god’ and ‘piyadassi’ meant ‘pleasant to behold’
 from the asokan inscription we know the anguish of the ruler and the change in his attitude towards warfare
these inscriptions have been found in odisha
sometimes what we consider politically and economically significant was not recorded in the inscriptions
 the content of inscriptions invariably projects the perspective of the person who commissioned these
 the inscriptions are unable to reflect about the life of different social groups including the marginalised groups
thus new strategies of analysis should be adopted
emergence of concept kingship  different rulers in the various parts of india established their empire
this gave rise to new kingdoms new communities and towns
emergence of new kingdoms  new kingdoms emerged in the deccan and further south including the cholas cheras and pandyas
satavahanas and shakas derived revenues from long-distance trade
kushanas ruled over a vast kingdom and considered themselves as god adopting the title devaputra son of god
 histories of the gupta rulers were reconstructed from literature coins and inscriptions including prashastis
the prayaga prashasti also called allahabad pillar inscription by harisena is the most important source to know about the gupta rulers
emergence of new communities  historians examined stories of jatakas and panchatantra to know about the view of common people regarding the rulers
strategies for increasing agricultural production were developed including use of iron-tipped plough and the use of irrigation through wells and tanks
 advancement of agriculture led to emergence of different communities of people viz large landholders small peasants and landless agricultural labourers
from early tamil literature and pali texts categories of people like gahapati master of a household vellar large land owners uzhavar plough men and adimai slaves are known
 inscription gave details about the land grants to brahmanas and peasants
prabhavati gupta daughter of chandragupta ii had access to land which she later granted but common women had no access to lands
some historians think that land grant is a strategy to extend agriculture to new areas others thought it as the indication of weakening of political power
people living in these areas traded artefacts like fine pottery known as northern black polished ware ornaments tools weapons vessels figurines made of gold silver copper bronze ivory glass shell and teracotta
 guilds or shrenis procured raw materials regulated production and marketed the finished product
the trade extended beyond the sub-continent central asia east and north africa south-east asia and china
 successful merchants designated as masattuvan in tamil set this and satavahanas in prakrit became very’ rich
exchanges were facilitated by the introduction of silver copper and gold coins
 the first coins to bear the names and images of rulers were issued by the indo-greeks who established control over the north-western part of the sub-continent in nd century bce
 the first gold coins were issued in st century’ ce by the some of the most spectacular gold coins were issued by the gupta rulers

 a new change began to occur with the expansion of agriculture
 emergence of different crafts and distinct social groups also witnessed during this period
 social disparities began to increase as a result of unequal distribution of wealth
 historian made use of textual tradition for many reasons
 according to the text written in ancient the most popular and famous is mahabharata which was composed between  bce and  ce
 historians believed that it was written by ved vyasa but most of the historians think that it is the creation of many authors
 in the beginning mahabharata was known by the name of jail and held only  verses
later on the number of verses increased to one lakh
 an important work began in  under the leadership of v
sukthankar a famous sanskrit scholar who took up cudgels to prepare a critical edition of mahabharata
these relations were based on lineage or vansha are developed by a family
 patriliny means that the descent which is traced from father to son then grandson and great grandson
 patriliny was prevalent even before the mahabharata yet mahabharata strengthen it
historians often use textual traditions to understand the socio-economic changes of the society
in this case it is very necessary to keep in mind who composed what and for whom
the language and the ways in which the text is circulated are also important
kinship marriage rules and different practices  families usually form parts of larger network of people defined as relative or ‘kinfolks’ while familial ties are often regarded as ‘natural’ and based on blood they are defined in many different ways
 it is more difficult to reconstruct the familial relationships of ordinary people than elite families
under patriliny sons could claim the throne or other resources of their fathers when the latter died
 the idea of patriliny is also accepted in the rigveda
 daughters had no claims to the resources of the household
also marrying them into families outside the kin was desirable
kanyadan or the gift of a daughter in marriage was an important religious duty of the father
 from  bce codes of social behaviour were compiled in dharmasutras and dharmashastras written in sanskrit
the most important dharmashastra was manusmriti compiled between  bce and  ce
 codes of social behaviour were given by the brahmanas
there were eight forms of marriage of which the first four were considered as good while the remaining were condemned
 people were classified according to their gotras
two important rules about gotras were  women were expected to give up their father’s golra and adopt their husband’s gotra
 members of the same gotra could not many  in case of satavahana rulers it was evident that many of the wives of satavahana rulers retained the names of their father’s gotra as against brahmanical rule
 endogamy or marriage within the kingroup was prevalent among several communities in south india
social differences  the dharmashastras and dharmasutras contained rules about the ideal ‘occupations’ of the four categories or varnas
 brahmanas were supposed to study and teach the vedas perform sacrifices and get sacrifices performed kshatriyas were to engage in warfare protect people and administer justice vaishyas were engaged in agriculture pastoralism and trade and shudras were assigned to serve the three ‘higher’ varnas
but in reality political power was effectively open to anyone w’ho could muster assemble support and resources and rarely depended on birth
 gotami-puta siri-satakani was a brahmana who destroyed the pride of kshatriyas
he ordered that there was no inter-marriage amongst members of the four varnas
there were other categories like nishada people living in forest beyond the four varnas in society
ekalavya is supposed to have belonged to this class
 sometimes those who spoke non-sanskrit languages were labelled as mlechchhas and looked down upon
 brahmanical scriptures developed a sharper social divide by classifying certain social categories as ‘untouchable’
 those who performed ‘polluting’ activities like handling corpses and dead animals were designated as ‘chandalas’
 the manusmriti laid down the duties of chandalas these were—they had to live outside the village use discarded utensils and wear clothes of the dead and ornaments of iron
 historians got hints of different social realities about the chandalas from the non-brahmanical texts
social status and right to property  according to the manusmriti the paternal estate was to be divided equally amongst sons after the death of the parents with a special share for the eldest
 women had no claim in her paternal estate but were allowed to retain the gifts they received on the occasion of their marriage as stridhana
 according to brahmanical text apart from gender criterion for regulating access to wealth was varna
the only ‘occupation’ prescribed for shudras was servitude slavery while a variety of occupations were listed for men of first three varnas
 the buddhists recognised the differences in society but did not regard these as natural or inflexible
they rejected the idea of claims to status on the basis of birth
 the buddhists developed an alternative understanding of social inequalities and the institutions required to regulate social conflict
 the institution of kingship was based on human choice with taxes as a form of payment for services rendered by the king
