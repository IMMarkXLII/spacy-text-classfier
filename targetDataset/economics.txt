importance of averages since countries have different populations comparing total income does not tell us what an average person is likely to earn hence we compare the average income which is the total income of the country divided by its total population
it is also called per capita income
criterion used by the world bank as per world development report  in classifying the countries
world bank says that countries with the per capita income of rs  per annum and above in  are called rich countries and those with the per capita income of rs  or less are called low-income countries
india comes in the category of low income countries because its per capita income in  was just rs  per annum
rich countries excluding the countries of middle-east and certain other small countries are generally called developed countries
growth of economy along with the improvement in the quality of life of the people like health education etc
is the average income obtained as the ratio between national income and population of a country
is the money value of final goods and services produced by a country during an accounting year
human development index it is a composite index prepared by united nations development programme undp through its annual human development report published every year
major parameters such as longevity of life levels of literacy and per capita income are used to measure the development of countries
world countries are ranked accordingly in to very high developed countries high developed countries medium developed countries and low developed countries
the number of children that die before the age of one year as a proportion of  live birth in that particular year
it measures the proportion of literate population in the  and above age group
it is the total number of children of age group - attending school as a percentage of total number of children in the same age group
bmi one way to find out if adults are undernourished is to calculate body mass index
divide the weight of a person in kg by the square of the height in metres
if this figure is less than 
 then the person would be considered undernourished
if this bmi is more than  then a person is overweight
sustainable development it means development without hampering the environment
it is the process of development that satisfies the present needs without compromising the needs of the future generation
secondary sector covers activities in which natural products are changed into other forms through ways of manufacturing it is also called as industrial sector
tertiary sector these are the activities that help in the development of the primary & secondary sector
these activities by themselves do not produce good but they are an aid and support to the production process
example transportation-goods that are produced in the primary sector need to be transported by trucks or trains and than sold in the wholesale and retail shops storage—at times it is necessary to store these products in godowns which is also a service made available
communication -talking to others on telephone banking-borrowing money from the banks
since these activities are generate services rather than goods it is also called service sector
gross domestic product gdp the value of final goods and services produced in each sector during a particular year provides the total production of the sector for that year
and sum of production in three sectors give gross domestic product—gdp of the country
it is the value of all final goods and services produced within the country during a particular year
this kind of underemployment is hidden in contrast to someone who does not have a job
hence it is also called disguised unemployment
mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act  mnrega  under nrega  all those who are able to and are in need of work have been guaranteed  days of employment in a year by the government
if the government fails in its duty to provide employment it will give unemployment allowances to the people
there are rules and regulations but these are not followed
public sector in this sector government owns most of the assets and provides all the services
growing importance of tertiary sector  in any country several services such as hospitals  educational institutions post and telegraph services police stations courts village administrative offices municipal corporations defense transport banks insurance companies etc
 the development of the agriculture and industrial leads to the development of services such as transport trade storage and the like
greater the development of primary and secondary sectors more will be demand of such services
 as the income level rise certain sections of people start demanding many more services like eating out tourism shopping  private hospitals professional training etc
this is found especially in the big cities
 over the past decade or so certain new services such as those based on the information and communication technology have become important & essential
in many of our day to day transactions goods are being bought & sold with the use of money
 the reason as to why transactions are made in money is that a person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she wants
 double coincidence of wants when in the exchange both parties agree to sell and buy each others commodities it is called double coincidence of wants
in the barter system double coincidence of wants is an essential feature
 demand deposits in bank deposits in the bank account that can be withdrawn on demand
people need only some currency for their day to day needs
for instance workers who receive their salaries at the end of each month have some extra cash
they deposit it with the banks by opening a bank account in their name
bank accept the deposits and also pay an interest rate on the deposits
 cheque paper instructing the bank to pay a specific amount from a person’s account to the person in whose name the cheque is drawn
 reserve bank of india it is the central bank of india which controls the monetary policy of the country
reserve bank of india supervises the activities of formal sector and keep the track of their activities but there is no one supervise the functioning of informal sector
periodically banks have to submit information to the rbi on how much they are lending and to whom at what interest rate etc
 credit the activity of borrowing and lending money between two parties
 collateral collateral is an asset that the borrower owns such as land building vehicle livestock deposits with banks and uses this as a guarantee to a lender until the loan is repaid
property such as land titles deposits with banks livestock are some common examples of collateral used for borrowing
 terms of credit interest rate collateral and documentation requirement and the mode of repayment together comprise what is called the terms of credit
the terms of credit vary substantially from one credit arrangement to another
they may vary depending on the nature of the lender and the borrower
 formal sector includes banks & cooperatives rbi supervises the functioning of formal sources of loans
to see that the bank maintains a minimum cash balance and monitors that these banks give loans not just to profit-making business and traders but also to small cultivators  small scale industries  to small borrowers etc
periodically banks have to submit information to rbi of their activities
 informal sector includes money lenders traders employers relatives & friends etc
there is no one to supervise their credit activities
they can charge whatever rate of interest
there is no one to stop them from using unfair means to get their money back
saving per month varies from - rupees or more depending upon the ability of the people
members take small loans from group itself to meet their needs
an mnc is a company that owns and controls production in more than one nation
foreign investment is investment made by mncs
advantages of foreign trade— 
‘foreign trade’ has facilitated the travel of goods from one market to another
it provides a choice of goods to the buyers
producers of different countries have to compete in different markets
prices of similar goods in two markets in two different countries become almost equal
sezs or special economic zones are industrial zones being set up by the central and state governments in different parts of the country
sezs are to have world class facilities such as electricity water roads transport storage recreational and educational facilities
companies who set up production units in sezs are exempted from taxes for an initial period of five years
sezs thus help to attract foreign companies to invest in india
reasons to put barriers to foreign trade 
the indian government after independence had put barriers to foreign trade and investment
this was done to protect the producers within the country from foreign competition
industries were just coming up in the s and s and competition from imports at that stage would not have allowed these industries to develop and grow
imports of only essential items such as machinery fertilizers petroleum etc
to protect the indian economy from foreign infiltration in industries affecting the economic growth of the country as planned
around  some changes were made in policy by the indian government as it was decided that the time had come for the indian producers to compete with foreign producers
this would not only help the indian producers to improve their performance but also improve their quality
liberalization means the removal of barriers and restrictions set by the government on foreign trade
governments use trade barriers to increase or decrease regulate foreign trade to protect the domestic industries from foreign competition
around  government india adopted the policy of liberalization
its main objective is to liberalize international trade
privatization means transfer of ownership of property from public sector to private sector
business process outsourcing bpo is the contracting of non primary business activities and functions to a third party service provider
economic reforms or new economic policy is policy adopted by the government of india since july 
its key features are liberalization privatisation and globalisation lpg
mncs set up production in various countries based on the following factors  mncs set up offices and factories for production in regions where they can get cheap labour and other resources e
 in countries like china bangladesh and india
 at times mncs set up production jointly with some of the local companies of countries around the world
the benefit of such joint production to the local company is two-fold
first the mncs can provide money for additional investments for faster production
secondly the mncs bring with them the latest technology for enhancing and improving production
 some mncs are so big that their wealth exceeds the entire budgets of some developing countries
this is the reason why they buy up local companies to expand production
example cargill foods an american mnc has bought over small indian company such as parakh foods
 garments footwear sports items etc
the products are supplied to these mncs which then sell these under their own brand name to customers
factors which have helped in globalization  technology
rapid improvement in technology has contributed greatly towards globalization
 development in information and communication technology has also helped a great deal
telecommunication facilities — telegraph telephone including mobile phones fax are now used to contact one another quickly around the world
teleconferences help in saving frequent long trips across the globe
 information technology has also played an important role in spreading out production of services across countries
orders are placed through internet designing is done on computers even payment for designing and printing can be arranged through internet
some common ways by which consumers may be exploited by manufacturers and traders  underweight and under-measurement goods sold in the market are sometimes not measured or weighed correctly
 high prices very often the traders charge a price higher than the prescribed retail price
 sub-standard quality the goods sold are sometimes of sub-standard quality e
selling medicines beyond their date of expiry selling deficient or defective home appliances
 duplicate articles in the name of genuine parts or goods fake or duplicate items are sold
 adulteration and impurity in costly edible items like oil ghee and spices adulteration is common in order to earn more profit
this causes heavy loss to the consumers
 lack of safety devices fake or inferior electronic goods electrical devices or other appliances produced locally lack the required in-built safety measures
they sell their goods for a higher price by creating panic among consumers
 false and incomplete information is provided by sellers which can easily mislead consumers
 unsatisfactory after-sale service the suppliers do not provide the satisfactory after-sale service despite the necessary payments on items such as electronics automobiles etc
copra this act copra  tries to ensure  information safety redressal representation and consumer education
 under copra a’ three tier quasi-judicial machinery at the district state and national level helps in solving consumer disputes
right to information act  this act gives rights to the citizen to have information about the government departments their policies practices and procedures
isi mark a certification mark for industrial products in india developed by the bureau of indian standards
agmark a certification mark employed on agricultural products in india by the directorate of marketing and inspection
hallmark an official mark struck on items made of precious metals like gold silver platinum etc
duties of consumers while shopping are a consumer must check for a certification of quality such as isi mark agmark or hallmark consumers must ensure that they receive a valid bill or cash memo and warranty on purchase of items especially electronic goods such as tv laptop mobile phones etc
they guide consumers on how to file cases in the consumer court
they represent consumers in the consumer courts
macroeconomics is the part of economic theory that studies the economy as a whole such as national income aggregate employment general price level aggregate consumption aggregate investment etc
its main instruments are aggregate demand and aggregate supply
it is also called the ‘income theory’ or ‘employment theory’
structure of macro economy as we know macroeconomics is concerned with economic problems at the level of an economy as a whole
structure of macroeconomics implies study of different sectors of the economy
an economy may be divided into different sectors depending on the nature of study
a producer sector engaged in the production of goods and services
b household sector engaged in the consumption of goods and services
note households are taken as the owners of factors of production
c the government sector engaged in activities like taxation and subsidies d rest of the world sector engaged in exports and imports
e financial sector or financial system engaged in the activity of borrowing and lending
it refers to flow of money income or the flow of goods and services across different sectors of the economy in a circular form
there are two types of circular flow a realproductphysical flow b moneymonetarynominal flow a real flow i real flow of income implies the flow of factor services from the household sector to the producing sector and corresponding flow of goods and services from the producing sector to the household sector
ii let us consider a simple economy consisting only of  sectors • producer sector
• household as the owners of factors of production supplies factors of production or factor services to the producers
this interdependence can be explained with the help of the diagram given here
b money flow i money flow refers to the flow of factor income as rent interest profit and wages from the producing sector to the household sector as monetary rewards for their factor services as shown in the flowchart
ii the households spend their incomes on the goods and services produced by the producing sector
accordingly money flows back to the producing sector as household expenditure as shown in the flowchart
ii household supply factor services to firms
iii firms hire factor services from households
iv households spend their entire income on consumption
v firms sell all that is produced to the households
vi there is no government or foreign trade
such an economy described above has two types of markets
i market for goods and services that is product market
ii market for factors of production factor market
as a result we can derive the following in the case of our simple economy i total production of goods and services by firms = total consumption of goods and services by household sector
ii factor payments by firms = factor incomes of household sector
iii consumption expenditure of household sector = income of firm
iv hence real flows of production and consumption of firms and households = money flows of income and expenditure of firms and households
phases of circular flow there are three types of phases of circular flow
i production phase • it deals with the production of goods and services by the producer sector
• if we study it in term of the quantity of goods and services produced it is a real flow
but it is a money flow if we study it in terms of the market value of the goods produced
ii distribution phase it means the flow of income in the form of rent interest profit and wages paid by producer sector to the household sector
it is a money flow
iii disposition phase • disposition means expenditure made
this phase deals with expenditure on the purchase of goods and services by households and other sectors
• this is a money flow from other sectors to the producer sector
some basic concepts of macroeconomics 
factor income a income earned by factor of production by rendering their productive services in the production process is known as factor income
b it is a bilateral two-sided concept
c it is included in national income as it contribute something in the flow of goods and services
examples rent interest wages and profit
transfer income a income received without rendering any productive services is known as transfer income
b it is a unilateral one-sided concept
c it is not included in national income as it does not contribute anything in the flow of goods and services
examples old age pension scholarship unemployment allowance
there are two types of transfers i current transfers ii capital transfers i current transfers • transfers made from the income of the payer and added to the income of the recipient who receive for consumption expenditure are called current transfers
• it is recurring or regular in nature
for example scholarships gifts old age pension etc
ii capital transfers • capital transfers are defined as transfers in cash and in kind for the purpose of investment to recipients made out of the wealth or saving of the donor
• it is non-recurring or irregular in nature
for example investment grant capital gains tax war damages etc
stock a any economic variable which is calculated at a particular point of time is known as stock
b it is static in nature i
 it do not change
c there is no time dimension in stock variables
for example distance amount of money money supply water in tank etc
flow a any economic variable which is calculated during a period of time is known as flow
b it is dynamic in nature i
 it can be changed
c there is time dimension in flow variables
for example speed spending of money water in river exports imports etc
economic territory or domestic territory a according to the united nations economic territory is the geographical territory administered by a government within which persons goods and capital circulate freely
b the above definition is based on the criterion “freedom of circulation of persons goods and capital”
clearly those parts of the political frontiers or boundaries of a country where the government of that country does not enjoy the above “freedom” are not to be included in economic territory of that country
i one example is embassies
government of india does not enjoy the above freedom in the foreign embassies located within india
so these are not treated as a part of economic territory of india
they are treated as part of the economic territories of their respective countries
embassy in india is a part of economic territory of the u
similarly the indian embassy in washington is a part of economic territory of india
located within the geographical boundaries of a country
iii in layman terms the domestic territory of a nation is understood to be the territory lying within the political frontiers or boundaries of a country
but in national income accounting the term domestic territory is used in a wider sense
based on ‘freedom’ criterion the scope of economic territory is defined to cover • ships and aircrafts owned and operated by normal residents between two or more countries
for example indian ships moving between china and india i regularly are part of domestic territory of india
similarly planes operated by air india between russia and japan are part of the domestic territory of india
similarly planes operated by malaysian airlines between india and japan are a part of the domestic territory of malaysia
• fishing vessels oil and natural gas rigs and floating platforms operated by the residents of a country in the international waters where they have exclusive rights of operation
for example fishing boats operated by indian fishermen in international waters of indian ocean will be considered a part of domestic territory of india
• embassies consulates and military establishments of a country located abroad
for example indian embassy in russia is a part of the domestic territory of india
citizenship a citizenship is basically a legal concept based on the place of birth of the person or some legal provisions allowing a person to become a citizen
b it means indian citizenship can arise in two ways i when a person is born in india he acquires automatic citizenship of india
ii a person born outside india applies for citizenship and indian law allows him to become indian citizen
normal residentresident a a normal resident whether a person or an institution is one whose centre of economic interest lies in the economic territory of the country in which he lives
b the centre of economic interest implies in two things i the resident lives or is located within the economic territory for more than one year and ii the resident carries out the basic economic activities of earnings spending and accumulation from that location c there is a difference between the terms normal resident resident and citizen or national
i a person becomes a national of a country because he was born in the country or on the basis of some other legal criterion
ii a person is treated resident of a country on the basis of economic criterion
iii it is not necessary that a resident must also be the national of that country
even foreigners can be the residents if they pass the above stated economic criterion
for example a large number of indian nationals have settled in u
as residents and not as nationals of these countries
for india they are non-resident indians nri but continue to remain indian nationals
following are not included under the category of normal residents i foreign visitors in the country for such purposes as recreation holidays medical treatment study tours conferences sports events business etc
they are supposed to stay in the host country for less than one year
in case they continue to stay for one year or more in the host country they will be treated as normal residents of the host country
ii crew members of foreign vessels commercial travelers and seasonal workers in the country foreign workers who work part of the year in the country in response to the varying seasonal demand for labour and return to their households and border workers who regularly cross the frontier each day or somewhat less regularly i
each week to work in the neighboring country are the normal residents of their own countries
iii officials diplomats and members of the armed forces of a foreign country
however the staffs of these bodies are treated as normal residents of the country in which the international body operates
v foreigners who are the employees of non-resident enterprises and who have come to the country for purposes of installing machinery or equipment purchased from their employers
they are supposed to stay for less than one year
in case they continue to stay for one year or more they will be treated as normal residents of the host country
final goods a these are the goods that are used for i personal consumption like bread purchased by consumer household or if investment or capital formation like building machinery purchased by a firm b in other words final goods are those which require no further processing and are available in an economy for consumption purpose or investment
these give direct satisfaction to a consumer
c according to production boundary if a good crosses the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to final consumer or investment made by a producer within the imaginary line of production unit is known as the final good
intermediate goods a these are the goods that are used for i further processing like sugar used for making sweets or ii resale in the same year if car purchased by car dealer for resale
b in other words intermediate goods are the ones which require further processing and are not available in an economy for the purpose of consumption
these goods give indirect satisfaction to a consumer
c according to the production boundary if a good does not cross the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to other firm within the production boundary is known as intermediate good
point to remember for final goods and intermediate goods a basis of classification if a good is used for i personal consumption or ii investment then it is a final good whereas if a good is used for i further processing or ii resale in the same year then it is known as intermediate good
thus the basis of classification between these two goods is not the commodity itself but the use made of it
for example bread used by a consumer household is a final goods but the same used by a bakery for making a sandwich is a intermediate goods
b production boundary i production boundary plays a vital role to differentiate between intermediate and final goods
the production boundary is the imaginary line around the production unit
ii according to the production boundary if a good crosses the imaginary line around the production unit and reaches to final consumer or investment made by a producer within the imaginary line of production unit it is known as final good
in the given diagram there are  production units
the thick border drawn around these three units is the production boundary
within this limit wheat and flour are intermediate goods
bread is final good as it lies outside the purview of production boundary
important points about intermediate goods as far as intermediate consumption of general government is concerned it’s purchased goods ranges from ordinary writing paper pencils and pens to sophisticated fighter aircrafts
the goods and services purchased include both durable goods and non-durable goods and services
the intermediate consumption of the general government includes the following items a value of all non-durable goods and services such as petrol electricity lubricants stationery soaps towels etc
including repair and maintenance of capital stock non-durable goods and services are those which have an expected life time of use of less than one year
repair and maintenance of capital stock mean expenditure incurred for maintaining fixed assets and keep them in good working order
this includes the expenditure on new parts of the fixed assets
the life of the new parts may be around one year or slightly more and the value should be relatively small
for example replacement of the tyres of a truck is an intermediate consumption but not the replacement of its engine
b expenditure on military equipment missiles rockets bombs warships submarines military aircrafts tanks missile carriers and rocket-launchers etc
whose function is to release weapons
military vehicles and light weapons
c value of goods received from foreign governments in form of gifts or as transfers
however the goods received for distribution to consumer households without renovation or alternation should not be included in intermediate consumption as these goods go into the final consumption of consumer households
d as we know intermediate goods are purchased by one production unit from another production unit within the production boundary
however it’s not necessary that all purchases by one production unit from other production units are intermediate purchases
for example purchases of building machinery etc
are not intermediate purchases if they are not meant for resale in the same year
rather these purchases are meant for investment and are termed as final product
e research and development • commodities consumed
in research and exploratory activities like oil exploration in different parts of india by the oil and natural gas commission or improving the technology of a particular production process
• commodities used in basic scientific research
• advertisements market research and public relationship meant for improving the goodwill of the business enterprises
• business expenses of the employees on tours and entertainment
final goods can be classified into two groups consumption goods and capital goods
a consumption goods i meaning consumption goods are those which satisfy the wants of the consumers directly
for example cars television sets bread furniture air-conditioners etc
categories of consumption goods • durable goods these goods have an expected life time of several years and of relatively high value
they are motor cars refrigerators television sets washing machines air-conditioners kitchen equipments computers communication equipments etc
• semi-durable goods these goods have an expected life time of use of one year or slightly more
they are not of relatively great value
examples are clothing furniture electrical appliances like fans electric irons hot plates and crockery
• non-durable goods goods which can not be used again and again i
 they lose their identity in a single act of consumption are known as non-durable goods
these are foodgrains milk and milk products edible oils beverages vegetables tobacco and other food articles
• services services are non-material goods which satisfy the human wants directly
they cannot be seen or touched i
 they are intangible in nature
these are medical care transport and communications education domestic services rendered by hired servants etc
b capital goods i capital goods are defined as all goods produced for use in future productive processes
for example all the durable goods like cars trucks refrigerators buildings aircrafts air-fields and submarines used to produce goods and are ready for sale in the market are a part of capital goods
iii some more examples of capital goods are machinery equipment roads and bridges
iv these goods require repair or replacement over time as their value depreciate over a period of time
differentiate between final goods and intermediate goods on the basis of end used classification of goods and services with example
circular flow of income it refers to flow of money income or the flow of goods and services across different sectors of the economy in a circular form
money flow nominal flow money flow refers to the flow of factor income as rent interest profit and wages from the producing sector to the household sector as monetary rewards for their factor services
real flow or physical flow real flow of income implies the flow of factor services from the household sector to the producing sector and corresponding flow of goods and services from the producing sector to the household sector
factor income income earned by factor of production by rendering their productive services in the production process is known as factor income
transfer income income received without rendering any productive services is known as transfer income
current transfers transfers made from the current income of the payer and added to the current income of the recipient who receive for consumption expenditure are called current transfers
capital transfers capital transfers are defined as transfers in cash and in kind for the purpose of investment to recipient made out of the wealth or saving of a donor
final goods these are those which are used for a personal consumption like bread purchased by consumer household or b investment or capital formation like building machinery purchased by a firm 
intermediate goods these are those which are used for a further processing like sugar used for making sweets or b resale in the same year if car purchased by a car dealer for resale
consumption goods consumption goods are those goods which satisfy the wants of consumers directly
capital goods capital goods are defined as all goods produced for use in future productive processes
numerically to determine private income personal income personal disposable income national disposable income net and gross and their differences
gross means the value of product including depreciation
net means the value of product excluding depreciation
the difference between these two terms is depreciation
where depreciation is the expected decrease in the value of fixed capital assets due to its general use
it is the result of production process
gross = net + depreciation net = gross – depreciation note other names of depreciation are a consumption of fixed capital b capital consumption allowance c current replacement cost
national income and domestic income 
national income refers to net money value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during an accounting year
domestic income refers to a total factor incomes earned by the factor of production within the domestic territory of a country during an accounting year
the difference between these two incomes is net factor income from abroad nfia which is included in national income ny and excluded from domestic income dy
where nfia is the difference between income earned by normal residents from rest of the world and similar payments made to non residents within the domestic territory
nfia = income earned by residents from rest of the world row – payments to non-residents within domestic territory
ny = dy + nfia dy = ny – nfia note case i income paid to abroad is given then to make nfia inverse the sign
example income paid to abroad = nfia = income from abroad – income paid to abroad =  –  = - and vice versa
case ii income from abroad is given then nfia = income from abroad
for this put income paid to abroad 
example income from abroad = nfia = income from abroad- income paid to abroad =  –  =  and vice versa case iii if income from abroad and income paid to abroad both are given then nfia is the difference between them example income from abroad = income paid to abroad = nfia = income from abroad- income paid to abroad =  –  = -  and vice versa case iv net factor income to abroad be given then to make nfia inverse the sign
net factor income paid to abroad nfpa = income to abroad – income from abroad
example i net factor income to abroad nfpa = 
in this nfpa is positive which means that income to abroad is greater than income from abroad which makes nfia = - ii net factor income to abroad nfpa = -
in this nfpa is negative which means that income to abroad is less than income from abroad which makes nfia = +  factor cost and market price 
factor cost fc it refers to amount paid to factors of production for their contribution in the production process
market price mp it refers to the price at which product is actually sold in the market
the difference between these two is net indirect taxes nit which is included in mp and excluded from fc
where nit is the difference between indirect taxes and subsidies
nit = it – subsidies where indirect taxes are the taxes which are levied by the government on production and sale of commodity
sales tax excise duty custom duty etc
are some of the indirect taxes and subsidies are the cash grants given by the government to the enterprises to encourage production of certain commodities to promote exports or to sell goods at prices lower than the free market price
in india lpg cylinder is sold at subsidized rates
mp = fc + nit indirect taxes – subsidies fc = mp – nit indirect taxes – subsidies note case i subsidy is given then to make nit inverse the sign
for this put indirect tax = 
example subsidy =  nit = indirect tax – subsidies = - = -  and vice versa case ii it is given then nit = it for this put subsidy  example it =  nit = indirect tax – subsidies = - =  and vice versa case iii if it and subsidy both are given then nit is the difference
example sales tax = rs
 excise duty = rs
 nit = indirect taxsales tax + excise duty-subsidies =  +  –  =  case v if net subsidy is given then to convert it into net indirect tax we have to inverse the sign net subsidy = subsidy – indirect tax example a net subsidy = 
in this net subsidy is positive which means that indirect tax is less than subsidy which makes nit = -  b net subsidy = - 
in this net subsidy is negative which means that indirect tax is greater than subsidy which makes nit =  case vi if net subsidy and indirect tax both are given then we have to ignore indirect tax and inverse the sign of net subsidy
example net subsidy =  indirect tax =  net indirect tax = -  numeribals illustration on basic concept aggregate of national income 
gross domestic product at market price gdpmp  gdpmp is defined as the gross market value of the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during an accounting year by all production units
a ‘gross’ in gdpmp signifies that depreciation is included i
 no provision has been made for depreciation
b ‘domestic’ in gdpmp signifies that it includes all the final goods and services produced by all the production units located within the economic territory irrespective of the fact whether produced by residents or non-residents
c ‘market price’ in gdpmp signifies that indirect taxes are included and subsidies are excluded i
 it shows that net indirect taxes nit have been included
d ‘product’ in gdpmp signifies that only final goods and services have to be included and intermediate goods should not be included to avoid the double counting
gross domestic product at factor cost  gdpfc gdpfc is defined as the gross factor value of the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during an accounting year by all production units excluding net indirect tax
gdpfc = gdpmp – net indirect taxes 
net domestic product at market price ndpmp 
ndpmp is defined as the net market value of all the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country by its normal residents and non-residents during an accounting year
ndpmp =gdpmp – depreciation 
net domestic product at factor cost ndpfc 
ndpfc refers to a total factor income earned by the factor of production within the domestic territory of a country during an accounting year
gross national product at market price gnpmp
gnpmp refers to market value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during an accounting year
gnpmp = gdpmp + net factor income from abroad it must be noted that gnpmp can be less than gdpmp when nfia is negative
however gnpmp will be more than gdpmp when nfia is positive
gross national product at factor cost gdpfc  or gross national income gnpfc refers to gross factor value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during an accounting year
gdpfc = gnpmp – net indirect taxes 
net national product at market price nnpmp 
nnpmp refers to net market value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during an accounting year
nnpmp = gnpmp – depreciation 
net national product at factor cost nnpfc 
nnpfc refers to net money value of all the final goods and services produced by the normal residents of a country during an accounting year
nnpfc = gnpmp – depreciation – net indirect taxes it must be noted that nnpfc is also known as national income
real nominal aggregates activities excluded from gdp and does gdp measures social welfare 
national income at constant price a if national income is calculated on the basis of base year price index then it is known as national income at constant price
b it is also called real national income as it fluctuates due to the fluctuation in the flow of goods and services and price remains constant
national income at current price a if national income is calculated on the basis of current year price index then it is known as national income at current price
b it is also called monetary national income as it fluctuates due to the fluctuation in the flow of goods and services along with the price of the commodity
gnp at current mp when final goods and services included in gnp are valued at current mp i
 prices prevailing in the year for which gnp is being measured it is called gnp at current mp or nominal gnp
gnp at constant mp when final goods and services included in gnp are valued at constant prices i
prices of the base year it is called gnp at constant mp or real gnp
gnp deflator gnp deflator measures the average level of the prices of all the final goods and services that are produced within the domestic territory of an economy including nfia
gnp deflator is measured as the ratio of nominal gnp to real gnp multiplied by 
green gnp green gnp refers to gnp adjusted for loss of value due to a environmental degradation and b depletion of natural resources on account of overall production activity in the economy
activities excluded from gdpmp the activities are as follows a purely financial transactions it may be of three types i buying and selling of securities ii government transfer payments iii private transfer payments i buying and selling of securities • in financial markets potential savers and investors buy and sell financial assets such as shares and bonds
• while someone buys a share there is only a transfer of ownership right
it is a claim to ownership of assets
• trading in financial instruments does not imply production of final goods and services
as such these are not included in the gnp
ii government transfer payments • transfer payments are payments for which no goods and services are provided in exchange
• • pension payments employees social security measures etc
are examples for government transfer payment as there is no production of final goods and services in response to transfer payment transfer payments are not included in gnp
iii private transfer payments • items such as pocket money given by parents to their children elders gifting money to the young ones are private transfer payments
this is merely a transfer of money from one individual to another
hence this is not included in gnp
b transfer of used goods i gnp refers to the value of the final goods and services produced in a given year
ii hence goods produced in the previous time period cannot be included in the gnp
for example mr a sells his old bike to mr b for rs
 on th april  which was purchased by mr a on st march  for rs
this transaction should not be included as it has already been included in the  gnp and if we again include it then it will create the problem of double counting
vegetables can be grown in the backyard instead of buying them from the super market or an electrical fault can be repaired by the house owner himself instead of hiring an electrician
d illegal activities activities like gambling black-marketing etc
 should be excluded because all unlawful activities are beyond the scope of ny and also because there is statistical problem of their estimation
e leisure time activities activities like painting growing of flowers in kitchen garden etc
is not included as their aim is not to earn money but to pass away free time in one’s hobby or entertainment again there is statistical problem of measuring their satisfaction derived in painting or any other leisure activities
limitations of using gdp as an index of welfare of a country there are many reasons behind this
these are a many goods and services contributing economic welfare are not included in gdp or non- monetary exchanges i there are many goods and services which are left out of estimation of national income on account of practical estimation difficulties e
 services of housewives and other members own account production etc
ii these are left on account of non-availability of data and problem in valuation
iii it is generally agreed that these items contribute to economic welfare
iv so if we depend only on gdp we would be underestimating economic welfare
b externality i when the activities of somebody result in benefits or harms to others with no payment received for the benefit and na payment made for the harm done such benefits and harms are called externalities
ii activities resulting in benefits to others are positive externalities and increase welfare and those resulting in harm to others are called negative externalities and thus decrease welfare
iii gdp does not take into account these externalities
for example construction of a flyover or a highway reduces transport cost and journey time of its users who have not contributed anything towards its cost
expenditure on construction is included in gdp but not the positive externalities flowing from it
gdp and positive externalities both increase welfare
therefore taking only gdp as an index of welfare understates welfare
it means that welfare is much more than it is indicated by gdp
iv similarly gdp also does not take into account negative externalities
for examples factories produce goods but at the same time create pollution of water and air
river yamuna now a drain is a living example
the factories are not required to pay anything for harming people
producing goods increases welfare but creating pollution reduces welfare
therefore taking only gdp as an index of welfare overstates welfare
in this case welfare is much less than indicated by gdp
c change in the distribution of income gdp may affect welfare i all people do not earn the same amount of income
some earn more and some earn less
in other words there is unequal distribution of income
ii at the same time it is also true that in the event of rise in ‘per capita real income’ all are not better off equally
‘per capita’ is only an average
in case of some it may even fall
iii it means that the inequality in the distribution of income may increase or decrease
iv if it increase it implies that rich become more rich and the poor become more poor
v utility of a rupee of income to the poor is more than to the rich
suppose the income of the poor declines by one rupee and that of the rich increases by one rupee
in such a case the decline in welfare of the poor will be more than the increase in welfare of the rich
vi therefore if the rise in per capita real income inequality increases it may lead to a decline in welfare in the macro sense
d all products may not contribute equally to economic welfare i gdp includes different types of products like food articles houses clothes police services military services etc
ii some of these products contribute more to the welfare of the people like food clothes houses etc
other products like police services military services etc
may comparatively contribute less and may not directly affect the standard of living of the people
iii therefore how much is the economic welfare would depend more on the types of goods and services produced and not simply how much is produced
iv it means that if gdp rises the increase in welfare may not be in the same proportion
e contribution of some products may be negative i gdp includes all final products whether it is milk or liquor
ii milk may provide both immediate and ultimate satisfaction to consumers
on the other hand liquor may provide some immediate satisfaction but because of its harmful effects on health it may lead to decline in welfare
iii gdp include only the monetary values of the products and not their contribution to welfare
iv therefore economic welfare depends not only on the volume of consumption but also on the type or goods and services consumed
methods of national income and how to determine national income by income method and its numericals steps and precaution there are three methods of calculating national income
these are a income method b expenditure method c value added methodproduct methodoutput method national income determination under income method a “production creates income”
if we want to calculate national income by income method then we have to add different factor incomes from the economy
b the addition of all these factor incomes gives us the calculation near by the national income i
 net domestic product at fc ndpfc
c components of income method 
compensation of employees coeemoluments of employees the amount earned by employees from their employers whether in cash or in kind or through any other social security scheme is known as compensation of employees
this is broadly divided into the following three components a wages and salaries payable in cash i wages and salaries receivable by the employees in respect of their work
ii special allowances for working overtime
iv bonuses v commissions gratuities tips cost of living i
 dearness allowance paid in our country honorarium vacation sick leave allowance etc
vi pensions at the time of retirement deferred wage pensions at the time of retirement are related to factor services rendered by recipient prior to their retirement
it is also known as deferred wage
any expenses incurred by the employees and thereafter reimbursed by the business enterprise should be excluded from compensation of employees coe as such expenses are part of intermediate consumption of business enterprise
b wages and salaries in kind remuneration in kind consists of goods and services that are not necessary for work and can be used by employees at their own discretion for the satisfaction of their needs or wants or those of other members of their households
it includes i meals and drinks including those consumed when travelling for business
iii the services of vehicles or other durables provided for the personal use of the employees
iv goods and services produced as outputs from the employer’s own process of production such as free travel for the employees of railways or airlines or free coal for miners
v sports recreation or holiday facilities for employees and their families
vi creches for children of employees
vii value of the interest foregone by employers when they provide loans to employees at reduced or even zero rates of interest for the purposes of buying houses furniture or other goods and services
it should be kept in mind that it does not include any facilities which are necessary for work and in which employees do not have any discretion
for example uniforms or other forms of special clothing to be used for work only
examples are uniforms for police uniforms of drivers uniforms for nurses in the hospital
it’s so because such payments are intermediate consumption of business enterprises
c employers’ contribution to social security schemes employers’ make payments to social security schemes like life insurance causality insurance pension schemes etc
for example there is a contributory provident fund scheme for employees of educational institutions and public sector undertakings
the contribution made by the employers for such schemes is a part of compensation of employees
the thing which has to be remembered is that employers’ contribution towards social security scheme should be included whereas employees’ contribution towards social security scheme should not be included as coe is that what the employer pays to employee and if anything borne by employee himself should not be included under coe
” operating surplus = gvomp – intermediate consumption – coe – mixed income – depreciation – nit in other words it is the sum of income from property and income from entrepreneurship
operating surplus have the following two components a income from property it is the income which has been arisen from rent interest and royalty
it also includes imputed rent
if a person living in his own house then it is assumed in an economy that he is paying rent to himself
this concept is known as imputed rent
ii royalty royalties are the payments made for the use of mineral deposits such as coal oil etc
or for the use of patents copyrights trademarks etc
iii interest it is the amount earned for lending funds to the production units
it also includes imputed interest of funds provided by entrepreneur
but interest income includes interest on loan taken for productive services only
the following categories of interest should not be included  • interest on national debt or interest paid by government on nation debt should not be included as it is assumed that such interest is paid on loan taken for consumption purpose
• interest paid by one firm to another firm as it is already included in the profit of the firm which pays it
b income from entrepreneurship it is a return of entrepreneur after paying all the other factors of production
it is of the following three types i distributed profit dividend it is that part of total profit which is given to shareholders
the thing to be noted here is that profit earned by one firm to another should not be included under this head because it is already included in the profit of the firm which pays it
ii undistributed profit saving of private corporate sector or retained £arnings it is that part of total profit which is not given to shareholders and kept as a reserve for future uncertainties
iii corporation tax profit tax it is that part of total profit which is given by a firm to the government as tax
the concept of operating surplus is applicable to all producing enterprises whether they belong to the private sector or to the government
the government enterprises also are expected to earn reasonable rate of profit on the funds invested
but operating surplus does not arise in the general government sector as they produce goods and services for the social welfare of the country and not for profit motive i
 why rent interest and profit are zero in general government sector
mixed income income of own account workers like farmers doctors barbers etc
 and unincorporated enterprises like small shopkeepers repair shops is known as mixed income
they do not maintain proper accounts
they do not generally hire factor services from the market rather use their own resources like land labour funds etc
as the result of it becomes difficult to classify their income distinctly among rent wages interest and profit
ndpfc compensation of employees coe + operating surplus os + mixed income my method for calculating national income by income method if we want to calculate national income by income method we have to add different factor incomes from the economy
the addition of all these factor incomes gives us the calculation near by the national income i
net domestic product at fc ndpfc
profit earned by one firm to another should not be included because it is a part of intermediate consumption
if profit after tax is given and corporate tax is given then by adding them we get profit
profit after tax =  corporate tax = profit = 
if profit before tax and corporate tax are given then ignore corporate tax
profit before tax =  corporate tax = profit =  steps for calculating national income by income method step  to identify enterprises which employ primary factors land labour capital enterprise
step  to classify various types of factor income like a compensation of employees the amount earned by employees from their employer whether in cash or in kind or through any other social security scheme is known as compensation of employees
b operating surplus it is the sum of income from property and income from entrepreneurship
c mixed income income of own account workers like farmers doctors barbers etc
 and unincorporated enterprises like small shopkeepers repair shops is known as mixed income
step  to estimate amount of factor payments made by each producing unit
step  to add all factor incomes  payments within domestic territory to get domestic income i
ndpfc = compensation of employees + operating surplus + mixed income step  addition of nfia to ndpfc to get ny i
a avoid transfers national income includes only factor payments i
 payment for the services rendered to the production units by the owners of factors
any payment for which no service is rendered is called a transfer not a production activity
b avoid capital gain capital gain refers to the income from the sale of second hand goods and financial assets
income from the sale of old cars old house bonds debentures etc
these transactions are not production transactions
so any income arising to the owners of such things is not a factor income
c include income from self-consumed output when a house owner lives in his house he does not pay any rent
but infact he pays rent to himself
since rent is a payment for services rendered even though rendered to the owner itself it must be counted as a factor payment
d include free services provided by the owners of the production units owners work in their own unit but do not charge salary
owners provide finance but do not charge any interest
owners do production in their own buildings but do not charge rent
although they do not charge yet the services have been performed
the imputed value of these must be included in national income
how to determine national income by expenditure method and its numericals steps and precautions national income determination by expenditure method a “production creates income income creates expenditure”
if we want to calculate national income by this method we have to add different final expenditures from an economy
b the addition of all those final expenditure gives us the calculation near by the national income i
components of expenditure method 
government final consumption expenditure gfce the expenditure made by a general government on current expenditure on goods and services like public health defence law and order education etc
these goods and services generate no income because it is produce by a general government without any profit motive
these goods and services are valued at their cost to the government as they are not sold to the citizen and have been produced for the social welfare of the citizens
so gfce = intermediate consumption of government + compensation of employees wages and salaries in cash and in kind by government + direct purchases made abroad by government purchases made by embassies and consulates located in foreign countries + consumption of fixed capital depreciation – sale of goods and services by government
private final consumption expenditure pfce private final consumption expenditure is defined as consumption expenditure by consumer households household final consumption expenditure and private npish non-profit institution serving households on all types of consumer goods
pfce = household final consumption expenditure + private non-profit institution serving households final consumption expenditure
the value of following items is measured for getting private final consumption expenditure
a purchases of currently produced goods and services in the domestic market by consumer households and npish
b direct purchases made abroad by resident households are added but direct purchases in domestic market by non-resident households and extra territorial bodies are deducted
note if in the examination problem household final consumption expenditure is not given it can be calculated as under household final consumption expenditure = personal disposable income – personal household saving 
gross domestic capital formation or gross investment or investment expenditure it refers to additions to the physical stock of capital during a period of time
it includes building machinery housing construction construction of factories etc
it has been classified into the following categories
a gross domestic fixed capital formation gdfcf it is the expenditure incurred on purchase of fixed assets
it is of three types i gross business fixed investment it is the amount that the business units spend on purchase of newly produced capital goods like plant and equipments
gross business fixed investment is the gross amount spent on newly produced fixed capital goods
when depreciation is deducted from it we obtain net business fixed investment
gross business fixed investment = net business fixed investment + depreciation ii gross residential construction investment this is the amount spent on construction of flats and residential houses
the investment is said to be gross when depreciation is not deducted and net when depreciation is deducted
iii gross public investment this includes capital formation by government in the form of building of roads bridges schools hospitals etc
this investment is called gross when depreciation is not deducted and net when depreciation is subtracted
b change in stock closing stock – opening stock or inventory investment it is the net change in inventories of final goods finished goods semi-finished goods and raw material
these are included as they represent currently produced goods which are not included in the current sale of final output
it is a difference between closing stock and the opening stock of the year
c net acquisition of valuables these are those high value durable goods like gold silver amtiques etc
which are taken at market price
gdcf = gross domestic fixed capital formation gdfcf + change in stock closing stock – opening stock + net acquisition of valuables or gdcf = gross business fixed investment + gross residential construction + gross public investment + inventory investment + net acquisition of valuables 
net export export – import it shows the difference between domestic spending on foreign goods i
 imports and foreign spending on domestic goods i
thus the difference between exports and imports of a country is called net exports
barter system and its difficulties money and functions of money 
barter system of exchange is a system in which goods are exchanged for goods
for example wheat may be exchanged for cloth house for horses etc
 or a teacher may be paid wheat or rice as a payment for hisher services
such exchange exists in the c-c economy commodity to commodity exchange economy
note in c-c economy c stands for commodity
c-c economy is the one in which commodities are exchanged for commodities
c-c exchange refers to barter system of exchange
hence c-c economy is an economy dominated by barter system of exchange
it is double coincidence of wants
ii double coincidence of wants means that goods in possession of two different persons must be useful and needed by each other
it is the main basis of barter system of exchange
iii it is difficult to find such a person every time
in barter system exchange becomes quite limited
b lack of divisibility i in commodity exchange difficulty of dividing the commodity arises
ii for example if a car is to be exchanged for a scooter then car can not be divided
similarly animals can not be divided into smaller units
c difficulty in storing wealth i it is very difficult to store wealth for future use
ii most of the goods like wheat rice cattle etc
are likely to deteriorate with the passage of time or involve heavy cost of storage
iii further the transfer of goods from one place to another place involves huge transport cost
iv transfer of immovable commodities such as house farm land etc
d absence of common measure of value i different commodities are of different values
the value of a good or service means the amount of other goods and services it can be exchanged for in the market
there is no common measure of value under barter system
ii in this situation it is difficult to decide in what proportions are the two goods to be exchanged
e lack of standard of deferred payment in a barter economy future payments would have to be stated in terms of specific goods or services
this leads to following problems i there could be disagreement regarding the quality of the goods or services to be repaid
ii there would be disagreement regarding which specific commodities would be used for repayment
money money is something which is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and can be converted into other assets without losing its time and value
the following two functions are included under this category
i medium of exchange • money when used as a medium of exchange helps to eliminate the basic limitation of barter trade that is the lack of double coincidence of wants
• individuals can exchange their goods and services for money and then can use this money to buy other goods and services according to their needs and convenience
• thus the process of exchange shall have two parts a sale and a purchase
• the ease at which money is converted into other goods and services is called “liquidity of money”
ii measure of value unit of account • another important function of money is that it serves as a common measure of value or a unit of account
• under barter economy there was no common measure of value in which the values of different goods could be measured and compared with each other
money has also solved this difficulty
• as geoffrey crowther puts it “money acts as a standard measure of value to which all other things can be compared
” money measures the value of economic goods
• money works as a common denominator into which the values of all goods and services are expressed
• when we express the values of a commodity in terms of money it is called price and by knowing prices of the various commodities it is easy to calculate exchange ratios between them
b secondary functions i standard of deferred payments • credit has become the life and blood of a modern capitalist economy
• in millions of transactions instant payments are not made
• the debtors make a promise that they will make payments on some future date
in those situations money acts as a standard of deferred payments
• it has become possible because money has general acceptability its value is stable it is durable and homogeneous
ii store of vaiue • wealth can be conveniently stored in the form of money
money can be stored without loss in value
• savings are secured and can be used whenever there is a need
• money means goods and services
thus money serves as a store of value
• it is also known as asset function of money
characteristics or features of money a durability money must be durable and not likely to deteriorate rapidly with frequent handling
currency notes and coins are being used repeatedly and shall continue to do so for many years
b medium of exchange money is the thing that acts as a medium of exchange for the sale and purchase of goods and services
c weight money must be light in weight
paper money is better than metal coins because it is light in weight
d measure of value it not only serves as medium of exchange but also acts as a measure of value
the value of all the goods and services is expressed in terms of money
money has overcome the drawbacks of barter system barter system makes the exchange process very difficult and highly inefficient
money has overcome the drawbacks of barter system in the following manners a medium of exchange i under barter system there is lack of double coincidence of wants
ii with money as a medium exchange individuals can exchange their goods and services for money and then use this money to buy other goods and services according to their needs and conveniences
iii a buyer can buy goods through money and a seller can sell goods for money
b measure of value i under barter system there was no common measure of value
money has also solved this difficulty
ii as geoffrey crowther puts it “money acts as a standard measure of value to which all other things can be compared
” money measures the value of economic goods
iii money works as a common denominator into which the values of all goods and services are expressed
iv when we express the values of a commodity in terms of money it is called price and by knowing prices of the various commodities it is easy to calculate exchange ratios between them
c store of value i under barter system it is very difficult to store wealth for future use
ii most of the goods are perishable and their storage requires huge space and transportation cost
iii wealth can be conveniently stored in the form of money
iv money can be stored without loss in value
v money can easily be stored for future use
d standard of deferred payments i under barter system transactions on deferred payments are not possible
ii with money the debtors make a promise that they will make payments on some future dates
in these situations money acts as a standard of deferred payments
iii it has become possible because money has general acceptability its value is stable it is durable and homogeneous
b paper notes and coins together called currency is money as a matter of law
c nobody can refuse its acceptance as medium of exchange
d in other words it is legal tender
it means people have to accept it legally for different payments
currency is also called fiat money because it commands ‘fiat’ orderauthority of the government
functional definition of money functional definition of money refers to money as anything that performs four basic functions a it serves as a medium of exchange
b it serves as a standard unit of value
c it serves as a means for future  contractual payments or standard of deferred payments
d it serves as a store of value
according to this definition of money includes both notes and coins as well as chequeable deposits with the banks
narrow definition of money functional definition of money is a narrow definition of money
it includes only notes coins and demand deposits as money
in other words in its narrow definition money includes only those things that function as money in terms of a medium of exchange
c standard of futuredeferred payments
broad definition of money a a broad definition of money also includes time depositsterm deposits with the banks or post offices as a component of money
b these deposits can be converted into demand deposits on a short notice and are “near money assets”
money assets and near money assets together make up a definition of money
money supply and measures of money supply 
money supply the volume of money held by the public at a point of time in an economy is referred to as the money supply
money supply is a stock concept
measures of money supply on the recommendation of the second working group on money supply the rbi presented four measures of money supply in its  issues of rbi bulletin namely m m m and m
measures of m include a currency notes and coins with the public excluding cash in hand of all commercial banks c b demand deposits of all commercial and co-operative banks excluding inter-bank deposits
dd where demand deposits are those deposits which can be withdrawn by the depositor at any time by means of cheque
no interest is paid on such deposits
c other deposits with rbi o
d m = c + dd + od where other deposits are the deposits held by the rbi of all economic units except the government and banks
 foreign central banks and governments the international monetary fund the world bank etc
measures of m i m c + dd + od ii post office saving deposits measures of m i m ii time deposits of all commercial and co-operative banks
where time deposits are the deposits that cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the stipulated time for which deposits are made
fixed deposit is an example of time deposit
high-powered money high-powered money is money produced by the rbi and the government
it consists of two things a currency held by the public and b cash reserves with the banks
barter system barter system of exchange is a system in which goods are exchanged for goods
double coincidence of wants it means that goods in possession of two different persons must be useful and needed by each other
money money is something which is generally acceptable as a medium of exchange and can be converted into other assets without loosing its time and value
legal definition of money legally money is anything proclaimed by law as a medium of exchange
paper notes and coins together called currency is money as a matter of law
fiat money it is defined as a money which is under the ‘fiat’ orderauthority of the government to act as a money
functional definition of money functional definition of money refers to money as anything that performs four basic functions
medium of exchange standard unit of value standard of deferred payments store of value 
narrow definition of money functional definition of money is a narrow definition of money
it includes only notes coins and demand deposits as money
broad definition of money a broad definition of money also includes time deposits term deposits with the banks or post offices as a component of money
money supply the stock of money held by the public at a point of time in an economy is referred to as the money supply
money supply is a stock concept
high-powered money it is money produced by the rbi and the government
it consists of two things i currency held by the public and ii cash reserves with the banks
demand deposits these are the deposits that can be withdrawn by the depositor at any time by means of cheque
no interest is paid on such deposits
time deposits these are the deposits that cannot be withdrawn before the expiry of the stipulated time for which deposits are made
fixed deposit is an example of time deposit
od includes demand deposits of semi-government public financial institutions like idbi ifci etc
 foreign central banks and governments the international monetary fund the world bank etc
commercial bank and credit creation by commercial bank 
commercial bank is a financial institution which performs the functions of accepting deposits from the public and making loans and investments with the motive of earning profit
process of money creationdeposit creationcredit creation by the commercial banking system
a let us assume that the entire commercial banking system is one unit
let us call this one unit simply “banks’
let us also assume that all receipts and payments in the economy are routed through the banks
one who makes payment does it by writing cheque
the one who receives payment deposits the same in his deposit account
b suppose initially people deposit rs
the banks use this money for giving loans
but the banks cannot use the whole of deposit for this purpose
it is legally compulsory for the banks to keep a certain minimum fraction of these deposits as cash
the fraction is called the legal reserve ratio lrr
the lrr is fixed by the central bank
a part of the lrr is to be kept with the central bank and this part ratio is called the cash reserve ratio
the other part is kept by the banks with themselves and is called the statutory liquidity ratio
c let us now explain the process suppose the initial deposits in banks is rs
 and the lrr is  percent
further suppose that banks keep only the minimum required i
 as cash reserve banks are now free to lend the remainder rs
what banks do to open deposit accounts in the names of the borrowers who are free to withdraw the amount whenever they like
• suppose they withdraw the whole of amount for making payments
d now since all the transactions are routed through the banks the money spent by the borrowers comes back into the banks into the deposit accounts of those who have received this payment
this increases demand deposit in banks by 
it is  per cent of the initial deposit
 have resulted on account of loans given by the banks
in this sense the banks are responsible for money creation
with this round increased in total deposits are now rs
the borrowers use these loans for making payments
the money comes back into the accounts of those who have received the payments
bank deposits again rise but by a smaller amount of rs
it is  per cent of the last deposit creation
the total deposits now increase to rs
 = +  + 
the process does not end here
f the deposit creation continues in the above manner
the deposits go on increasing round after round but deposit creation by commercial banks each time only  per cent of the last round deposits
at the same time cash reserves go on increasing each time  per cent of the last cash reserve
the deposit creation comes to end when the total cash reserves become equal to the initial deposit
the total deposit creation comes to rs
 ten times the initial deposit as shown in the table
it can also be explained with the help of the following formula 
banks required to keep only a fraction of deposits as cash reserves banks are required to keep only a fraction of deposits as cash reserves because of the following two reasons a first the banking experience has revealed that not all depositors approach the banks for withdrawal of money at the same time and also that normally they withdraw a fraction of deposits
b secondly there is a constant flow of new deposits into the banks
therefore to meet the daily demand for withdrawal of cash it is sufficient for banks to keep only a fraction of deposits as a cash reserve
when the primary cash deposit in the banking system leads to multiple expansion in the total deposits it is known as money multiplier or credit multiplier
central bank and their functions 
the central bank is the apex institution of a country’s monetary system
the design and the control of the country’s monetary policy is its main responsibility
india’s central bank is the reserve bank of india
a currency authority i the central bank has the sole monopoly to issue currency notes
commercial banks cannot issue currency notes
currency notes issued by the central bank are the legal tender money
ii legal tender money is one which every individual is bound to accept by law in exchange for goods and services and in the discharge of debts
iii central bank has an issue department which is solely responsible for the issue of notes
iv however the monopoly of central bank to issue the currency notes may be partial in certain countries
v for example in india one rupee notes and all types of coins are issued by the government and all other notes are issued by the reserve bank of india
b banker agent and advisor to the government central bank everywhere in the world acts as banker fiscal agent and adviser to their respective government
i as banker as a banker to the government the central bank performs same functions as performed by the commercial banks to their customers
• it receives deposits from the government and collects cheques and drafts deposited in the government account
• it provides cash to the government as resumed for payment of salaries and wages to their staff and other cash disbursements
• it makes payments on behalf of the government
• it also advances short term loans to the government
• it supplies foreign exchange to the government for repaying external debt or making other payments
ii as fiscal agent as a fiscal agent it performs the following functions  • it manages the public debt
• it collects taxes and other payments on behalf of the government
• it represents the government in the international financial institutions such as world bank international monetary fund etc
iii as adviser • the central bank also acts as the financial adviser to the government
• it gives advice to the government on all financial and economic matters such as deficit financing devaluation of currency trade policy foreign exchange policy etc
banker’s bank and supervisor a banker’s bank central bank acts as the banker to the banks in three ways i custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks ii as the lender of the last resort and iii as clearing agent
every commercial bank has to keep a certain percent of its cash reserves with the central bank by law
ii as lender of the last resort
• as banker to the banks the central bank acts as the lender of the last resort
• in other words in case the commercial banks fail to meet their financial requirements from other sources they can as a last resort approach to the central bank for loans and advances
• the central bank assists such banks through discounting of approved securities and bills of exchange
ii as clearing agent • since it is the custodian of the cash reserves of the commercial banks the central bank can act as the clearinghouse for these banks
• since all banks have their accounts with the central bank the central bank can easily settle the claims of various banks against each other simply by book entries of transfers from and to their accounts
• this method of settling accounts is called clearing house function of the central bank
b supervisor i the central bank supervises regulate and control the commercial banks
ii the regulation of banks may be related to their licensing branch expansion liquidity of assets management amalgamation merging of banks and liquidation the winding of banks
iii the control is exercised by periodic inspection of banks and the returns filed by them
controller of money supply and credit principal instruments of monetary policy or credit control of the central bank of a country are broadly classified as a quantitative instruments or general tools and b qualitative instruments or selective tools
a quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of moneycredit in the economy
these instruments do not direct or restrict the flow of credit to some specific sectors of the economy
they are as under i bank rate discount rate • bank rate is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral security for purpose of loan
the thing which has to be remembered is that central bank lends to commercial banks and not to general public
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation -> central bank raises bank rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
-> it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates which discourages borrowers from taking loans which discourages investment
-> again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
-> thus expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced which will control the excess demand
-> decrease in bank rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates which encourages borrowers from taking loans which encourages investment
-> again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
-> thus expenditure on investment and consumption increase which will control the deficient demand
ii repo rate • repo rate is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
• these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
• it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price
• so keeping securities and borrowing is repo rate
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation -> central bank raises repo rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
-> it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates which discourages borrowers from taking loans which discourages investment
-> again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
-> thus expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced which will control the excess demand
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation -> central bank decreases repo rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
-> decrease in repo rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates which encourages borrowers from taking loans which encourages investment
-> again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
-> thus expenditure on investment and consumption increase which will control the deficient demand
iii reverse repo rate • it is the rate at which the central bank rbi borrows money from commercial bank
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation reverse repo rate is increased it encourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank to earn higher return on idle cash
it decreases the lending capability of commercial banks which controls excess demand
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation reverse repo rate is decreased it discourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank
it increases the lending capability of commercial banks which controls deficient demand
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation central bank sells government securities and bonds to commercial bank
with the sale of these securities the power of commercial bank of giving loans decreases which will control excess demand
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation central bank purchases government securities and bonds from commercial bank
with the purchase of these securities the power of commercial bank of giving loans increases which will control deficient demand
v varying reserve requirements • banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank which is known as legal reserve ratio
one is the cash reserve ratio or crr and the other is the slr or statutory liquidity ratio
• cash reserve ratio -> it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits which it is required to keep with the central bank
commercial banks have to keep with the central bank a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash reserves as a matter of law
-> for example if the minimum reserve ratio is % and total deposits of a certain bank is rs
 crore it will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank
-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation cash reserve ratio crr is raised to  per cent the bank will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy which will control excess demand
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation cash reserve ratio crr falls to  per cent the bank will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increasing credit availability in the economy which will control deficient demand
vi the statutory liquidity ratio slr • it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation the central bank increases statutory liquidity ratio slr which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation the central bank decreases statutory liquidity ratio slr which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increases credit availability in the economy
• it may consist of -> excess reserves -> unencumbered are not acting as security for loans from the central bank government and other approved securities securities whose repayment is guaranteed by the government and -> current account balances with other banks
b qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
it always pays less value than the security
• so the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation central bank raises marginal requirements
this discourages borrowing because it makes people gets less credit against their securities
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation central bank decreases marginal requirements
this encourages borrowing because it makes people get more credit against their securities
ii moral suasion • moral suasion implies persuasion request informal suggestion advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation it appeals for credit contraction
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation it appeals for credit expansion
iii selective credit controls sccs • in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation the central bank introduces rationing of credit in order to prevent excessive flow of credit particularly for speculative activities
it helps to wipe off the excess demand
• in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation the central bank withdraws rationing of credit and make efforts to encourage credit
commercial bank commercial bank is a financial institution which performs the functions of accepting deposits from the public and making loans and investments with the motive of earning profit
legal reserve ratio it is the minimum ratio of deposits legally required to be kept by the commercial banks with themselves statutory liquidity ratio and with the central bank cash reserve ratio
money multiplier or credit multiplier when the primary cash deposit in the banking system leads to multiple expansion in the total deposits it is known as money multiplier or credit multiplier
central bank the central bank is the apex institution of a country’s monetary system
the design and the control of the country’s monetary policy is its main responsibility
quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of moneycredit in the economy
qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy the instruments which are used to regulate the direction of credit is known as qualitative instruments
bank rate it is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral security for purpose of loan
repo rate it is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
reverse repo rate it is the rate at which the central bank rbi borrows money from commercial bank
open market operation it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
cash reserve ratio it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits which it is required to keep with the central bank
statutory liquidity ratio it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves
marginal requirement business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
it always pays less value than the security
so the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement
moral suasion it implies persuasion request informal suggestion advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank
selective credit controls sccs in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
factors causing backwardness and stagnation of indian agriculture during the british rule  land revenue settlement under the british raj  forced commercialisation of agriculture industrial sector “systematic de-industrialisation” is the term that describes the status of industrial sector during the british rule
it implied two things  decay of world famous traditional handicraft industry owing to discriminatory policies of the british government
 bleak growth of modern industry now to lack of investment opportunities
two-fold motive behind the systematic
industrialisation during the british rule in india
 to exploit india’s wealth of raw material and primary products
it was required to fulfill the emerging needs of industrial inputs in the wake of industrial revolution in britain
 to exploit india as a potential market for the industrial products of britain
foreign trade india had occupied a place of eminence in the area of foreign trade since ancient times
but the british rule in india ended this eminence
drain of india’s wealth huge administrative expenses were incurred by the british government to manage their colonial i ale in india
also huge expenses were incurred by the british government to fight wars in pursuit of their policy of imperialism
demographic condition demographic conditions during the british rule exhibited all features of a stagnant and backward economy
both birth rate and death rate were very high nearly  and  per thousand respectively
occupational structure greater dependence on agriculture as suggested by occupational structure on the eve of independence implied lesser availability of land per head for the farming population
accordingly agriculture was taken largely as a means of subsistence and less as an occupation for profit
development of infrastructure is a precondition to the economic and social development of a country
economy of a country includes all production distribution or economic activities that relates with people an determines the standard of living
on the eve of independence indian economy was in a very bad shape due to the presence of british colonial rule
the britishers generally framed policies that favoured england
the only purpose of britishers was to unjustly enrich themselves at the cost of india’s economic development
thus in  when british transferred power back to india we inherited a crippled economy
india’s national and per capital income under colonial rule there were no efforts from the part of the colonial government to measure the national and per capital income of india
some individual attempts were made to measure such incomes but produced conflicting and inconsistent results
the contribution of vkrv rao and dadabhai naoroji are considered very significant in this context
low economic growth under colonial rule india had an independent economy before the arrival of british rule
but the britishers dominated it for over a period of  years
britishers framed policies that protected and promoted the economic interests of their own country
they transformed india into supplier of raw materials and consumer of finished goods from the factories of britain
such policies affected indian economy very adversely
in this context we will discuss the conditions of certain sectors that were badly affected by the presence of colonial rule i
on the eve of independence
state of agriculture sector agriculture was the main source of livelihood for most of the people of india and about % of the country’s population lived mostly in villages and derived livelihood directly or indirectly from agriculture
inspite of such a large segment of the population being dependent of agriculture either directly or indirectly this sector was facing stagnation and constant deterioration as is brought forward through the following points
 low level of productivity productivity i
output per hectare of land was very low
this led to a low level of output inspite of a large area under cultivation
 high degree of vulnerability agriculture was vulnerable to climatic factors and mostly affected by erratic rainfall
poor rainfall generally led to a low level of output and also to crop failures
no effort was made by british government to provide permanent source of irrigation facilities for the farmers
the reasons for stagnation of agricultural sector were i land revenue system the britishers introduced the zamindari system
the zamindars were recognised as permanent owners of the soil
zamindars were to pay a fixed sum to the government as land revenue and they were absolutely free to extract as much from the tillers of the soil as they could
their main interest was in rent collection regardless of the economic conditions of cultivators and this caused misery and social tension among the latter
ii lacking of resources because the tillers had to pay huge amount of rent referred to as ‘lagaan’ they were not left with any surplus to be able to provide for resources needed in agriculture in the form of fertilisers or providing for irrigation facilities
this further lowered the agricultural productivity
iii commercialisation of agriculture commercialisation of agriculture refers to shift from cultivation for self-consumption to cultivation for sale in the market
it also refers to cultivation of cash-crops like cotton indigo etc
due to commercialisation of agriculture there was some evidences of a relatively higher yield of cash crops in certain areas of the country
but this could not help in improving the conditions of indian farmers
instead of producing food crops farmers were producing cash crops which were ultimately to be used by british industries
state of industrial sector in the pre-british period india was particularly well-known for its handicraft industries in the fields of cotton and silk textiles metal and precious stone works etc
these products enjoyed a worldwide market based on the reputation of the fine quality of material used and the high standards of craftsmanship
but the britishers followed a policy of systematic de-industrialisation by creating circumstances conducive to the decay of handicraft industry and not taking any steps to promote modern industry and reduced india to a mere exporter of raw material and importer of finished goods
the following points bring farword the state of the industrial sector at the eve of independence 
decay of handicraft industry the traditional handicraft industry in india enjoyed worldwide reputation but the british misrule in india led to the decline of indian handicraft industry
the britishers adopted the following policies to systematically destroy the handicraft industry
 discriminatory tariff policy of the state the britishers followed a discriminatory tariff policy by allowing tariff free exports of raw material from india to provide for the requirements of their industries in britain and tariff free import of british industrial products to promote british goods in india but placed a heavy duty on the export of handicraft products
so indian handicraft products started loosing their domestic as well as foreign markets
 competition from machine-made products machine-made products from britain were cheap and better in quality than the handicraft products
this competition forced many a handicrafts to shut down their business
 introduction of railways in india the britishers introduced railways in india to expand the market of its low priced industrial products
consequently the demand of high-priced handicraft products started to fall thus leading to the downfall of handicraft industry
slow growth of modem industry under second half of th
century modern industry showed slow growth
this development was confined to the setting up of cotton and jute textile mills
in this context the tata iron and steel company tisco was incorporated in august  in india
it established its first plant in jamshedpur bihar at present jharkhand
but these industries were the result of private endeavour
the state participation in the process of modem industrialisation was very limited as is evident from the following points  limited growth of public sector enterprises the public sector enterprises such as railways power post and telegraph were confined to areas which would enlarge the size of market for british products in india
 lopsided industrial structure the industrial growth was lopsided in the sense that consumer goods industry was not adequately supported by the capital goods industry
 lack of basic and heavy industries no priority was given for the development of basic and heavy industries
tata iron and steel mills was the only basic industry in india
textile industry in bengal muslin is a type of cotton textile which had its origin in bengalparticularly places in and around dhaka now the capital city of bangladesh
daccai muslin had gained worldwide fame as an exquisite type of cotton textile
the finest variety of muslin was called malmal
foreign travellers also used to refer to it as malmal shahi or malmal khas meaning that it was worn by or fit for the royalty
state of foreign trade india has been an important trading nation since ancient times
but when the restrictive policies of commodity production trade and tariff were imposed by the colonial government it adversely affected the structure composition and volume of india’s foreign trade
following were the reasons behind the poor growth of foreign trade 
exporter of primary products and importer of finished goods under the colonial rule india became an exporter of primary products such as raw silk cotton wool sugar indigo jute etc and an importer of finished consumer goods like cotton silk and woollen clothes and capital goods like light machinery produced in the factories of britain
britain’s monopoly control britain maintained a monopoly control over india’s exports and imports
due to this more than half of india’s foreign trade was restricted to britain while the rest was allowed with a few other countries like china ceylon sri lanka and persia iran
the opening of suez canal in  further intensified british control over india’s foreign trade
drain of india’s wealth an important characteristic of foreign trade throughout the colonial period was the generation of a large export surplus
but this surplus came at a huge cost to the country’s econo several essential commodities like food grains kerosene were scarcely available in the domestic market
also this surplus was not used in any developmental activity of india
rather it was used to maintain the administrative set-up of the britishers or bear the expenses of war taught by britain
all of this led to the drain of indian wealth
state of occupational structure during the colonial period the occupational structure of india exhibited its backwardness
there existed a growing regional disparity with few states such as orissa rajasthan and punjab witnessing an increase in agricultural workforce while the states which were the parts of madras presidency
bombay and bengal witnessed a decline in the percentage of work force dependent on agriculture
state of infrastructure infrastructure comprises of such industries which help in the growth of other industries
under the colonial period basic infrastructure such as railways port per transport posts and telegraphs developed
however the real motive behind this development was not to provide basic amenities to the people but to sub serve various colonial interests
the state of infrastructure under the colonial rule can be understood with the help of following points 
roads roads constructed before independence were not fit for modern transport
it was very difficult to reach rural areas during rainy season
the roads were built only to serve the purpose of mobilising the army within india and transporting raw materials from the countryside to the nearest railway station or the port for exporting it
railways british rulers introduced railways in india in  and it began its operation in 
it is considered as one of the important contribution of britishers
the railways affected the structure of the indian economy in the following two ways  it enabled people to undertake long distance travel and thereby break geographical and cultural barriers
 it fostered commercialisation of indian agriculture which adversely affected the self- sufficiency of the village economies in india
benefits provided by the railways was outweighed by the country’s huge economic loss
water and air transport the colonial rulers took measures for the development of water transport
the inland waterways at times also proved uneconomical as in the case of the coast canal on the orissa coast
the main purpose behind their development was to serve britain’s colonial interest
the colonial government also showed way to the air transport in  by establishing tata airlines
thus in this way it inaugurated the aviation sector in india
communication modern postal system started in india in 
the first telegraphy line was opened in 
the introduction of the expensive system of electric telegraph in india served the purpose of maintaining law and order
demographic condition various details about the population of british india were first collected through a census in 
before  india was in the first stage of demographic transition
however neither the total population of india nor the rate of population growth at this stage was very high
though suffering from certain limitations it revealed the unevenness in india’s population growth
the population grew at a rate of 
% up to the year 
on the eve of independence the demographic condition was as follows  the overall literacy level was less than %
 the female literacy level was at a negligible low rate of about %
 public health facilities were either unavailable to large chunks of population or when available were highly inadequate
infant mortality rate was  per thousand in contrast to present infant mortality rate of  per thousand
 life expectancy was very low  years in contrast to the present  years
 both birth rate and death rate were very high at  and  per thousand of persons respectively
capitalism it is an economic system in which major economic decisions like  what goods and services are to be produced
 how goods and services are to be distributed are left to the free play of the market forces or the forces of supply and demand
socialism it is an economic system in which major economic decisions are taken by the government keeping in view the collective interest of the society as a whole
mixed economy it is an economic system in which major economic decisions are taken by the central government authority as well as are left to the free play of the market forces
goals of five year plans a plan should have some clearly specified goals
the goals of five year plans are  growth economic growth implies a consistent increase in gdp or a consistent increase in the level of output or a consistent increase in the flow of goods and services in the economy over a long period of time
 modernisation to increase the production of goods and services to producers with the adoption of new technology
 self-reliance it means avoiding imports of those goods which could be produced in india itself
this policy was considered a necessity in order to reduce our dependence on foreign countries especially for food
agriculture it refers to all those activities which are related to the cultivation of land for the production of crops food crops and non-food crops
thus marketable surplus of wheat = output of wheat – on farm consumption of wheat green revolution it started in india in year -
in the year - itself foodgrain production increased by nearly %
so much increase in foodgrain production in a country which earlier used to import foodgrains
industry industry provides employment in agriculture it promotes modernisation and overall prosperity
importance of industry are as follows  structural transformation  source of employment  source of mechanised means of farming  imparts dynamism to growth process  growth of civilisation  infrastructural growth industrial policy resolution  ipr-  three-fold classification of industries  industrial licensing  industrial soaps private sector it was assigned only a secondary role in the process of industrialisation
industries in the private sector could be established only through a license from the government
small scale industries ssi these were accorded a high priority with a view to promoting the goals of ‘employment and equity’
import substitution inward looking trade strategy is called import substitution
on  th august  india attained its freedom
after independence nehru and many other leaders decided the type of economic system that will prove beneficial for india
topic  economic system and planning economic system economic system is defined as an arrangement by which the central problems of an economy are solved
the three basic central problems of an economic system are  choice of production what goods and services should be produced in the country  choice of technology how should the goods and services be produced should producers use more human labour or more capital for producing things  distribution of goods and services how should goods and services be distributed among people on the basis of government intervention economic system can be classified as socialist economy it is an economic system in which all economic decisions are taken by the government
in this system the government decides what goods are to be produced in accordance with the needs of society how goods are to be produced and how they should be distributed
socialist economy promotes equitable distribution of income
however it also suffers from the drawbacks of a bureaucratic set up in the form of red-tapism and corruption
in cuba and china most of the economic activities are governed by the socialistic principles
capitalist economy capitalist economies depend upon the market forces of demand and supply
in this type of economy only those consumer goods will be produced that have good demand in the market and yield profit to the producers
for example cars will be produced if they are in demand and also if they can earn profits for the producer
in this economy the goods and services produced are distributed among people not on the basis of what people need but on the basis of purchasing power
 capitalist economy generally manifests unequal distribution of income but it also generates fastest growth in output and national income  capitalist economy is also called laissez faire or free market economy it exists in north america japan australia western europe etc
mixed economy it is an economic system in which public sector and private sector exist side by side
in this economy the market will provide whatever goods and services it can produce well and the government will provide essential goods and services which the market fails to provide
merits of mixed economy  mixed economy gives proper scope to private individuals to co-exist and contribute towards economic development
 in this planned economic development ensures stability
it leads to enhanced productivity
demerits of mixed economy  mixed economy cannot effectively control the private sector industries which are outside the government purview
 it is characterised by red-tapism and high degree of corruption
 in it there is concentration of economic power in the hands of private sector politicians and bureaucrats
economic planning economic planning is a process in which a central authority of a country defines a set of goals to be achieved within a specified period sets out a plan to achieve those goals keeping in view the country’s resources
planning commission defines economic planning as ‘economic planning means utilisation of country’s resources in different development activities in accordance with national priorities’
now let us understand what a ‘plan’ is  a plan spells out how the resources of nation should be efficiendy utilised
 it should have some general goals which are achieved through specific objectives within a specified period of time
to formulate plans planning commission was set up in  under the chairmanship of jawaharlal nehru the first prime minister of independent india
its aim was to promote rapid rise in standard of living of the people increase production and offer employment opportunities in india
to facilitate economic planning five year plans were forniulated
the first five year plan was introduced in april 
all the five year plans are formulated keeping the below objectives in mind growth it refers to increase in the country’s capacity to produce the output of goods and services within the country
it implies either a larger stock of productive capital or a large size of supporting services like transport and banking
increase is gdp is a good indicator of economic growth
gross domestic product gdp is the market value of all final goods and services produced in the different sectors of an economy viz the primary sector the secondary sector and the tertiary sector during an year within the domestic teritory of a country
modernisation adoption of new technology is called modernisation
it is done with an aim to increase the production of goods and services
for example a farmer can increase the output on the farm by using new seed varieties instead of using old ones
modernisation refers to not only change in production methods but also change in the social outlook of a society by granting equal status to women and making use of their talent in the productive process
the first seven five year plans gave importance to self- reliance by avoiding imports
this policy was considered a necessity in order to reduce our dependence on foreign countries especially for food
equity it refers to reduction in disparity of income or wealth by uplifting weaker sections of the society
it also refers to distribution of economic power equally or in such way that every indian should be able to meet his or her basic needs such as food a decent house education healthcare etc
mahalanobis the architect of indian planning prasanta chandra mahalanobis was born in  in calcutta
he was educated at the presidency college in calcutta and at cambridge university in england
his contributions to the subject of statistics brought him international fame
mahalanobis established the indian statistical institute isi in calcutta and started a journal sankhya
mahalanobis had contributed a lot in the formulation of our five year plans
the second plan became the landmark of his contribution
during the second plan period mahalanobis invited many distinguished economists from india and abroad to advise him on india’s economic development
some of these economists became nobel prize winners later which shows that he could identify individuals with talent
many economists today reject the approach to planning formulated by mahalanobis but he will always be remembered for playing a vital role in putting india on the road to economic progress and statisticians continue to profit from his contribution to statistical theory
economic reforms started in  in india
need for economic reforms  mounting fiscal deficit  adverse balance of payment  gulf crisis  fall in foreign exchange reserves  rise in prices liberalisation liberalisation of the economy means its freedom from direct or physical controls imposed by the government
 de-reservation of production areas
 expansion of production capacity
 freedom to import goods
ii financial sector reforms liberalisation implied a substantial shift in the role of the rbi from a regulator to a facilitator of the financial sector
iii fiscal reforms fiscal reforms relate to revenue and expenditure of the government
tax reforms are the principal component of fiscal reforms
broadly taxes are classified  direct taxes and  indirect taxes iv external sector reforms it include foreign exchange reforms and foreign trade policy reforms
privatisation privatisation is the general process of involving the private sector in the ownership or operation of a state owned enterprise
disinvestment it refers to a situation when goverment sell off a part of its share capital of psus to the private investors
globalisation it may be defined as a process associated with increasing openness growing economic interdependence and deepening economic integration in the world economy
the government was unable to make repayments on its borrowings from abroad foreign exchange reserves were not sufficient to repay the debts
the prices of essential goods were rising and the imports were growing at a very high rate
as a result the government initiated a new set of policy measures to reform the conditions of an economy and several economic reform programme were also introduced in this respect to promote privatisation liberalisation and globalisation
economic crisis of  and indian economy reforms crisis in india is figured out because of the inefficient management of indian economy in s
the revenues generated by the government were not adequate to meet the growing expenses
so the government resorted to borrowing to pay for its debts and was caught is a debt-trap
deficit it refers to the excess of government expenditure over its revenue
causes of economic crisis different causes of economic crisis are given as under  the continued spending on development programmes of the government did not generate additional revenue
 the government was not able to generate sufficient funds from internal sources such as taxation
 expenditure on areas like social sector and defence do not provide immediate returns so there was a need to utilise the rest of its revenue in a highly effective manner which the government failed to do
 the income from public sector undertakings was also not very high to meet the growing expenditures
 no effort was made to reduce such increased spending and sufficient attention was not given to boost exports to pay for die growing needs
due to above stated reasons in the late s government expenditure began to exceed its revenue by such large margins that meeting the expenditure through borrowings became unsustainable
need for economic reforms the economic policy followed by the government upto  failed in many aspects and landed the country in an unprecedented economic crisis
the situation was so alarming that india’s reserves of foreign exchange were basely enough to pay for two weeks of imports
new loans were not available and nris were withdrawing large amounts
there was an erosion of confidence of international investors in the indian economy
the following points highlight the need for economic reforms in the country  increasing fiscal deficit  adverse balance of payments  gulf crisis  rise in prices  poor performance of public sector units psus
 high rate of deficit financing
 collapse of soviet block
emergence of new economic policy nep finally india approached international bank for reconstitution and development popularly known as world bank and international monetary fund imf and received $  million as loan to manage the crisis
international agencies expected india to liberalise and open up economy by removhfg restrictions on private sector and remove trade restrictions between india and other countries
india agreed to conditions of world bank and imf and had announced new economic polity nep which consist of wide range of economic reforms
the measures adopted in the new economic policy can be broadly classified into two groups i
  stablisation measures they are short-term measures which were intended to correct some weakness that have developed in the balance of payments and to bring inflation under control
 structural reforms they are longterm measures aimed at improving the efficiency of the economy and increasing its international competiveness by removing the rigidities in various segments of the indian economy
inflation it is a situation in which general price level of goods and services increases in an economy over a period of time
liberalist off privatisation and globalisation by introducing concept of liberalisation privatisation and globalisation government have revived the condition of indian economy
liberalisation libralisation was introduced with an aim to put an end to those restrictions which became major hindrances in growth and development of various sectors
it is generally defined as the lossening of government regulations in a country to allow for private sector companies to operate business transactions with fewer ristrictions
in relation to developing countries this term refers to opening of economic border for multinationals and foreign investment
objectives of liberalisation the main objectives of liberalisation policy are  to increase competition among domestic industries
 to increase foreign capital formation and technology
 to decrease the debt burden of the country
 to encourage export and import of goods and services
 to expand the size of the market
economic reforms under liberalisation reforms under liberalisation were introduced in many areas
let us discuss these now industrial sector reforms the following steps were taken to deregulate the industrial sector i abolition of industrial licensing government abolished the licensing requirement of all industries except for the five industries which are  liquor  cigarettes  defence equipment  industrial explosives  dangerous chemicals chugs and pharmaceuticals
ii contraction of public sector the number of industries reserved for the public sector was reduced from  to 
presendy only three industries are ’ reserved for public sector
iv expansion of production capacity the producer’s were allowed to expand their production capacity according to market demand
the need for licensing was abolished
v freedom to import capital goods the business and production units were given freedom to import capital goods to upgrade their technology
financial sector reforms financial sector includes financial institutions such as commercial banks investment banks stock exchange operations and foreign exchange market
the following reforms were initiated in this sector  reducing various ratio statutory liquidity ratio slr was lowered from 
cash reserve ratio crr was lowered from % to 
 competition from new private sector banks the banking sector was opened for the private sector
this led to an increase in competition and expansion of services for consumers
 change in the role of rbi rbi’s role underwent a change from a ‘regulator’ to a ‘facilitator’
 de-regulation of interest rates except for savings accounts banks were able to decide their own interest rates tax reformsfiscal reforms tax reforms are concerned with the reforms in government’s taxation and public expenditure policies which are collectively known as its fiscal policy
moderate and simplified tax structure prior to  the tax rates in the country were quite high which led to tax evasion
the fiscal reforms simplified the tax structure and lowered the rates of taxation
this reduced tax-evasion and increased government’s revenues
foreign exchange reformsexternal sector reforms external sector reforms include reforms relating to foreign exchange and foreign trade
the following reforms were initiated in this sector i devaluation of rupee devaluation implies a fall in the value of rupee against some foreign currency
in  the rupee was devalued to increase our country’s exports and to discourage imports
ii other measures  import quotas were abolished
 policy of import licensing was almost scrapped
 import duty was reduced
 export duty was completely withdrawn
however this had certain problems hence
wto was expected to establish a rule based trading regime in which nations cannot place arbitrary restrictions on trade
its purpose was mainly to expand production and trade in order to have optimum utilisation of world resources
the wto agreements cover {rade in goods as well as services to facilitate international trade through removal of tariff as well as non-tariff barriers and provide better market access to all countries
being an important member of wto
india has been in front to frame rule and regulations and safeguards interest of developing world
india has kept commitments towards liberalisation of trade in wto by removing quantitative restrictions on imports and reducing tariff rates
functions of wto  it facilitates the implementation administration and operation of the objectives of multilateral trade agreements
 it administers the ‘trade review mechanism’
 it administers the ‘understanding rules and procedures  governing the settlement disputes’
 it is a watchdog of international trade it examines the trade regimes of individual members
 trade disputes that cannot be solved through bilateral talks are forwarded to the wto dispute settlement ‘court’
 it is a management consultant for world trade
its economist keep a close watch on the activities of the global economy and provide studies on the main issues of the day
privatisation it refers to giving greater role to private sector thereby reducing the role of public sector
in other words it means shedding of the ownership or management of a government owned enterprise
it may also mean de-reservation of industries previously reserved for public sector
government companies public companies are converted into private companies in two ways  by withdrawal of the government from ownership and management of the public sector companies
 by the method of disinvestment
forms of privatisation different forms of privatisation are  denationalisation when % govermffdht ownership of productive assets is transferred to the private sector it is called denationalisation
it is also known as strategic sale
 partial privatisation when less than % or more than % ownership is transferred it is a case of partial privatisation with private sector owning majority of shares
in this situation the private sector can claim to possess substantial autonomy in its functioning
it is also known as partial sale
objectives of privatisation the most common and important objectives of privatisation are  improving the financial condition of the government
 raising funds through disinvestment
 reducing the workload of public sector
 increasing the efficiency of the government undertakings
 providing better goods and services to consumers
 bringing healthy competition within an economy
 making way for foreign direct investment fdi
navratnas and public enterprise policies in order to improve efficiency infuse professionalism and enable them to compete more effectively in the liberalised global environment the government identifies psus and declare them as maharatnas navratnas and mininavratnas
they were given greater managerial and operational autonomy in taking various decisions to run the company efficiently and thus increase their profits
greater operational financial and managerial autonomy has also been granted to profit-making enterprises referred to as mininavratnas
in  about  public enterprises were designated with different status
a few examples of public enterprises with their status are as follows  maharatnas  indian oil corporation limited  steel authority of india limited  navratnas  bharat heavy electricals limited  mahanagar telephone nigam limited  mininavratnas  bharat sanchar nigam limited  airport authority of india globalisation it means integration of the economy of the”country with the world economy
globalisation encourages foreign trade and private and institutional foreign investment
globalisation is a complex phenomenon and an outcome of the set of various policies that are aimed at transforming the world towards greater interdependence and integration
it is turning the into one whole or creating a borderless world
outsourcing an outcome of globalisation this is one of the important outcome of the globalisauon process
in outsourcing a company hires regular service from external sources mosdy from other countries which were previously provided internally or from within the country like legal advice computer service advertisement etc
in other words outsourcing means getting a work done on contract from someone outside
as a form of economic activity outsourcing has intensified in recent times because of the growth of fast modes of communication particularly the growth of information technology it
many of the services such as voice-based business processes popularly known as bpo or call centres record keeping accountancy banking services music recording film editing book transcription clinical advice or even teaching are being outsourced by companies in developed countries to india
most multinational corporations and even small companies are outsourcing their services to india where they can be availed at a cheaper cost with reasonable degree of skill and accuracy
the low wage rates and availability of skilled manpower in india have made it a destination for global outsourcing in the post reform period
economic growth during reforms growth of an economy is measured by the gross domestic product gdp
the growth of gdp increased from 
% during - to 
main highlights of economic growth during reforms are given below  during the reform period the growth of agriculture has declined
while the industrial sector reported fluctuation the growth of service sector has gone up
this indicates that the growth is mainly driven by the growth in the service sector
 the opening up of the economy has led to rapid increase in foreign direct investment and foreign exchange reserves
the foreign investment whiclyincludes foreign – direct investment fdi and foreign institutional investmentfii has increased from about us $  million in - to us $  billion in -
 there has been an increase in the foreign exchange reserves from about us $  billion in - to us $  billion in -
in  india is the seventh largest foreign exchange reserve holder in the world
 india is seen as a successful exporter of auto parts engineering goods it software and textiles in the reform period
rising prices have also been kept under control
failures of economic reforms i- neglect of agriculture there has been deterioration in agricultural growth rate
this deterioration is the root cause of the problem of rural distress that reached crisis in some parts of the country
 the removal of fertiliser subsidy has led to increase in the cost of production which has severely affected the small and marginal formers
 various policy changes like reduction in import duties on agricultural products removal of minimum support price and lifting of quantitative restrictions have increased the threat of* international competition to the indian formers
 export-oriented policy strategies in agriculture has been a shift from production for the domestic market towards production for the export market focusing on cash crops in lieu of production of food grains
ii- uneven growth in industrial sector industrial sector registered uneven growth during this period
this is because of decreasing demand of industrial products due to various reasons  cheaper imports have decreased the demand for domestic industrial goods
 globalisation created conditions for the free movement of goods and services from foreign countries that adversely affected the local industries and employment opportunities in developing countries
 there was inadequate investment in infrastructural facilities such as power supply
 a developing country like india still does not have the access to developed countries markets because of high non-tariff barriers
sirdlla tragedy privatisation of power supply in andhra pradesh resulted in substantial increase in power-rates causing many powerlooms to shut down in a small town sirdlla
 workers committed suicide because of loss in means of livelihood
ii- other failures in addition to the above mentioned failures the other drawbacks of lpg policy were  it led to urban concentration of growth process
 it encouraged economic colonialism
 it resulted in the spread of consumerism
 it led to cultural erosion
 relative poverty it refers to poverty in relation to different classes regions or countries
poverty line it is that line which expresses per capita average monthly expenditure by which people can satisfy their minimum needs
relative poverty and absolute poverty are the two variants of poverty
poverty line is fixed in india  in the estimation of consumption cut off
 in private consumption expenditure
 frequencies are recorded against each class-interval
each frequency counts the number of heads belonging to a particular consumption class
categorising poverty  category  chronic poor those who are always poor and those who are usually poor e
 category  transient poor those who are moving in and out of poverty and occasionally poor
 category  never poor these are categorised as non-poor people
rural poor these include landless agricultural work marginal holders and tenants-at-will
urban poor these include migrants from the rural areas in search of employment casual factory workers and self employed serving largely as street vendors
urban poor are largely the spillover of the rural poor who are forded to migrate in search of jobs
causes of poverty  low level of national product  low rate of growth  heavy pressure of population  inflationary pressures  chronic unemployment and under employment  capital deficiency  outdated social institutions  lack of infrastructure measures to remove poverty  combating poverty by accelerating the place of economic growth
 combating poverty through population control
 other measures enhancing quality of life of the poor
the key issues of action plan for rural development are  development of infrastructure  human capital formation  development of productive resources  poverty alleviation  land reforms rural credit rural credit means credit for the farming families
credit is the life line of farming activity credit needs of the typical indian farmer may broadly be classified as under  short term credit it needs relates basically to the purchase of inputs like seeds fertilisers etc short term borrowings generally stretches over a period of  to  months
 medium term credit medium term loans are required for purchasing machinery constructing fences and digging wells
such loans are generally stretch over a period of  months to  years
the period of such loan ranges between  to  years
sources of rural credit  non-institutional sources  institutional sources  co-operative credit societies  state bank of india  regional rural bank  national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard agriculture marketing it includes all those activities or processes which help a former getting maximum price for his produce among others these processes include grading packaging and storage
measures initiated by the government to improve market system  regulated markets  co-operative agricultural marketing societies  provision of warehousing facilities  subsidised transport  dissemination of information  msp policy diversification diversification is an emerging challenge in the context of rural development
 diversification of crop production it implies production of diverse variety of crops rather than one specialised crop
it means a shift form single-cropping system to multi-cropping system
 diversification of production activityemployment it implies a shift from crop farming to other areas of production activity employment
non-farm areas of production activityemployment for the rural population  animal husbandry it is the most important area of employment in india different from crop farming
it is also called live stock farming poultry cattle etc
 fisheries the fishing community in india depends almost equally on inland sources and marine sources of fishing
inland sources include rivers lakes ponds and streams etc
 horticulture horticultural crops include fruits vegetables and flowers besides several other
over time there has been a substantial increase in area under horticulture
agriculture is the major source of livelihood in the rural sector
mahatma gandhi once said that “real progress of india did not mean only the industrial growth but also the development of villages because two-third of india’s population depends on agriculture”
one-third of rural indians still live in poverty
this is the reason why there is need to develop rural india
rural development and rural credit rural development is a comprehensive term which essentially focuses on action for the development of areas that are lagging behind in the overall development of the village economy
it is a process whereby the standard of living of rural people especially poor people rises continuously
the basic objectives of rural development are  increasing the productivity of the agricultural sector so that the income of the formers increase
 generating alternative means of livelihood in the rural areas so that dependency on agriculture sector is reduced
 promoting education and health facilities in the rural areas so that human development is also achieved
key areas in rural development some of the areas which are challenging and need fresh initiatives for development in rural india are as follows  development of the productive resources of each locality
 development of human resources including literacy more specifically female literacy education and skill development
 development of human resources like health addressing both sanitation and public health
 infrastructure development like electricity irrigation credit marketing transport facilities including construction of village roads and feeder roads to nearby highways facilities for agriculture research and extension and information dissemination
 special measures for alleviation of poverty and bringing about significant improvement in the living conditions of the weaker sections of the populations emphasising access to productive employment opportunities
the share of agriculture sector’s contribution to gdp was on a decline the population dependent on this sector did not show any significant change
further after the initiation of reforms the growth rate of agriculture sector decelerated to 
% per annum during the s which was lower than the earlier years
rural credit credit is the life line of the farming activity
rural credit means providing credit for the forming community
farmers need credit because  most formers in india are small and marginal land holders who practice subsistence farming
they have no surplus for further production
 the gestation period between sowing and harvesting is quite high
so farmers have to borrow to fulfill their various needs during this period
borrowings of afarmer can befor thefollowingpurpose  productive borrowings these borrowings include loans to buy seeds fertilisers and agricultural equipments and imptements
 un-productive borrowings these borrowings include loans for social purposes such as marriage and festive occassions
types of rural credit credit needs of farmers may be classified as  long-term credit these loans are required to acquire permanent assets like tractors land costly equipments tube-wells etc
these loans are for a period of  to  years
 medium-term credit these loans are required for purchasing machinery constructing fences and digging wells
such loans are generally stretch over a period of  months to  years
 short-term credit these loans are required for buying seeds tools manure and fertilisers etc
this credit is given to the needy borrowers by cooperatives moneylenders and banks
these loans are for a period of  to  months
sources of rural credit credit in the rural sector is available from two sources 
non-institutional sources of rural credit the major non-institutional sources of rural credit are moneylenders friends relatives landlords shopkeepers and commission agents
% of total financial requirement rural areas in - and presently it is %
 they acquire land on failure to pay interest and loan
the poor women’s bank kudumbashree is women-oriented community based poverty i reduction programme being implemented in kerala
in  a thrift and credit society was started as a small savings for poor women with an objective to encourage savings
the thrift and credit society mobilised rs
 crore as thrift savings
these societies have been acclaimed as largest informal banks in asia in terms of participation and savings mobilised
institutional sources of rural credit in regard to rural credit major change occurred after  when india adopted social banking and multi agency approach to adequately meet the needs of rural credit
different institutions were formed to provide the rural credit
the major institutional sources of rural credit are as follows i national bank for agriculture and rural development nabard it was set up in  as an apex body to coordinate the activities of all institutions involved in the rural financing system
it has an authorised share capital of rs
the rbi has contributed half of the share capital while the other half has been contributed by government of india
the main functions of nabard are  to grant long-term loans to the state government for subscribing to the share capital of cooperative societies
 to take the responsibility of inspecting cooperative banks regional rural banks rrbs and primary cooperative societies
 to promote research in agriculture and rural development
 to serve as a refinancing agency for the institutions providing finance to rural and agricultural development
 to help tenant farmers and small farmers to consolidate their land holdings
the national agricultural credit fundjias been transferred from rbi to nabard to form a part of its national rural credit fund
ii self help groups shgs formal credit system has proven inadequate
it has also not been fully integrated into the overall rural social and community development
due to the demand of some kind of collateral vast proportion of poor rural households were automatically out of the credit networks
self help groups emerged to fill this gap created by formal credit system
self help groups shgs promote thrift in small proportions by a minimum contribution from each member
by march end  more than rs
 lakh shgs had reportedly been credit linked
such credit provisions are generally referred to as micro-credit programmes
shgs have helped in the empowerment of women
however borrowings from shgs are mainly confined to consumption purposes
these have been set up under the regional rural banks act-of 
their banking services are meant for small and marginal formers and artisans etc
they cater exclusively to the needs of weaker section
nearly % of the loan of rrbs were provided to the weaker section
kisan credit card scheme kisan credit card scheme kccs was introduced by the government in -
it facilitates access to credit from commercial banks and regional rural banks
under the scheme the eligible farmers are provided with a kisan card and pass book from the relevent bank
the farmers can make withdrawls and repayments of cash within the credit limit as – specified in the kisan credit card kcc
iv commercial banks they were inducted into the field of agricultural credit under the banking reforms act 
the share of commercial banks in the supply of agricultural credit has considerably improved
% during the year -
commercial banks disburse agricultural credit for the purchase of inputs cattle tractors dairy farming installation of tube-wells etc
v cooperative credit societies the cooperative credit societies are actively engaged in addressing credit needs of the farmers besides offering a host of related services
notably these societies provide guidance in diverse agricultural operations with a view to raise crop productivity
currendy cooperatives account for -% of rural credit flow
the main fimcdon of cooperative credit society is to provide timely and increased flow of credit to the farmers
latest status of agricultural credit the following points reveal the latest status of agricultural credit  the credit flow in this sector in - is placed at rs
 the agricultural debt waiver and debt relief scheme was announced in the union budget -
 farmers have been receiving crop loans upto a principal amount of rs
 lakh at an effective rate of % per annum
 to provide adequate and timely credit support to the formers the kisan credit card kcc scheme was introduced in february 
 crore kccs had been issued upto october 
 government is implementing a revival package for short-term rural cooperative credit structure involving financial outlay of rs
rural banking  a critical appraisal after the nationalisation of commercial banks in  the rapid expansion of the banking system in rural areas has been witnessed
rural banking has raised the level of rural farm and non-farm output income and employment especially after the green revolution
advantages of rural banking  raising farm and non-farm output by providing services and credit facilities to farmers
 generating credit for self employment schemes in rural areas
 achieving food security which is clear from the abundant buffer stocks of grains
 rural banking is suffering from the problems of large amount of over dues and default rate
 the sources of institutional finance are inadequate to meet the requirements of agricultural credit
 there exist regional inequalities in the distribution of institutional credit
it is suggestible that more and more regional rural banks should be set up to need the credit need of the rural and backward areas of india
in other words agricultural marketing covers the services involved in moving an agricultural product from the farm to the consumer
need of agriculture marketing need of agriculture marketing originates due to the problems faced by farmers
different types of problems faced by the farmers are  farmers while selling their produce to traders suffered from faulty weighing and manipulation of accounts
 due to lack of knowledge about the prices prevailing in the markets farmers are often forced to sell their produce at low prices
 farmers did not have proper storage facilities to keep back their produce for selling later at better price
approximately % of goods produced in farms is wasted due to lack of storage
distress sale lack of agricultural marketing infrastructure often forces the farmers to sell their produce at low prices for fear of spoilage or to pay off an imminent debt
this is termed as distress sale
farmers tend to suffer highly on account of these sales because they not only get a low price for their produce but are also cheated by use of false weights and are charged a high commission
measures by government to improve agriculture marketing four measures which were initiated to improve the agriculture marketing aspect are discussed below 
regulation of markets the first measure to improve agriculture marketing aspect is regulation of markets to create orderly and transparent marketing conditions
regulated markets have been established where sale and purchase of the produce is monitored by the market committee consisting of representatives of government farmers and the traders
market committee ensure that the formers get appropriate price of their produce
by and large this policy benefited farmers as well as consumers
however there is still need to develop about  rural periodic markets as regulated market places to realize the full potential of rural markets
improvement in physical infrastructure it is the second measure to improve the agriculture marketing aspect
through this measure government ensures the improvement in physical infrastructure
cooperative marketing it is the third measure taken by government in realising the fair prices for farmers products
as members of these societies formers find themselves better bargainers in the market and get better prices of their produce through collective sale
the success of milk cooperatives in gujarat and some other parts of the country are the brilliant examples of cooperative marketing
different problems faced by cooperative during the recent past are  inadequate coverage of former members
 lack of appropriate link between marketing and processing cooperatives
supporting policies it is the fourth measure taken by government to improve agriculture marketing system
different supportive policies applied in this regard are  minimum support price msp it is an important step to improve agriculture market system
msp is an assurance to the farmers that a minimum price will be fixed by the government to formers’ produce no purchasing can be done below this price however farmers can sell their produce in open market above msp
this policy assured a minimum income to the farmers
 maintenance of buffer stocks of wheat and rice purchases from the farmers are kept by food corporation of india as buffer stocks
 distribution of foodgrains and sugars through stocks purchased by government at msp are used primarily for public distribution system pds
distribution of foodgrains and other necessary items like kerosene oil at subsidised price to the poor takes place through fair price shops
 emerging alternative marketing channels in india alternative marketing channels are emerging
through these channels farmers directly sell their products to the consumers
this system increases farmers’ share in the prices paid by the consumers
important examples of such channels are  apni mandi punjab haryana and rajasthan
 hadaspar mandi pune rythu bazars vegetables and fruit market in andhra pradesh
 uzhavar sandies farmers’ markets in tamil nadu
 several national and international fast food chains and hotels are also entering into contracts with the farmers to supply them farm products fresh vegetables and fruits of the desired quality
diversification is an emerging challenge in the context of rural development
it has two aspects  diversification of crop production  diversification of productive activity diversification of crops this implies a shift from single cropping system to multi-cropping system
in india where subsistence farming is still dominant it may also mean a shift from subsistence farming to commercial farming
significance of diversification of crops diversification of crops is improtant because it will  minimise the risk occuring
due to failure of monsoon
 minimise the market risk arising due to price fluctuations
need of diversification into productive activities agriculture sector is a seasonal based activity most of agriculture employment activities are concentrated in kharif season
but during rabi season in the areas where irrigation facilities are inadequate it becomes difficult to find gainful employment
so there is a need to focus on allied activities non farm employment and other emerging alternatives of livelihood
also agriculture sector is already overcrowded a major proportion of the increasing labour force needs to find alternate employment opportunities in other non-farm sectors
some non-farm activities are discussed below 
animal husbandry in india the forming community uses the mixed crop-live stock forming system
cattle goats fowl are the widely domesticated species
livestock production provides increased stability in income food security transport fuel and nutrition for the family without disrupting other food producing activities
today livestock sector alone provides alternate livelihood options to over  million small and marginal farmers including landless labourers
poultry accounts for the largest share with % followed by others
india has about  million cattle including  million buffaloes
a significant number of women also find employment in the livestock sector
milk production in the country has increased by more thlkn five times between -
this can be attributed mainly to the successful implementation of ‘operation flood’
meat eggs wool and other by-products are also emerging as important productive sectors for diversification
in numbers our livestock population is quite impressive but its productivity is quite low as compared to other countries
it requires improved technology and promotion of good breeds of animals to enhance productivity
improved veterinary care and credit facilities to small and marginal formers and landless labourers would enhance sustainable livelihood options through livestock production
operation flood it is a system whereby all the farmers can pool their milk produced according to different grading based on quality and the same is processed and marketed to urban centres through cooperatives
gujarat state is held as a success story in the efficient implementation of milk cooperatives which has been emulated by many states
fisheries the socio-economic status of fishermen is comparatively lower because of  rampant underemployment  low per capital earnings  absence of mobility of labour to other sectors  high rate of illiteracy  indebtedness horticulture due to varying climate and soil conditions india has adopted growing of diverse horticultural crops such as fruits vegetables tuber crops flowers medicinal and aromatic plants spices and plantation crops
these crops play an important role in providing food nutrition and employment
the period between - is called ‘golden revolution’ because during this period the planned investment in horticulture became highly productive and the sector emerged as a sustainable livelihood option
india has emerged as a world leader in producing a variety of fruits like mangoes bananas coconuts cashew nuts and a number of species and is the second largest producer of fruits and vegetables
economic conditions of many formers engaged in horticulture has improved and has become a means of improving livelihood for many unprivileged classes
flower harvesting nursery maintance hybrid seed production and tissue culture propagation of fruits and flowers and food processing are highly profitable employment opportunities for rural women
it has been estimated that this sector provides employment to around % of the total labour force
other alternate livelihood options the information technology it has revolutionised many sectors in the indian economy
it plays a very significant role in achieving sustainable development and food security in the following ways  it can act as a tool for releasing the creative potential and knowledge embedded in our people
 issues like weather forecast crop treatment fertilisers pestisides storage conditions etc can be well administered if expert opinion is made available to the farmers
 the quality and quantity of crops can be increased manifold if the farmers are made aware of the latest equipments technologies and resources
 it has ushered in a knowledge economy
 it has potential of employment generation in rural areas
the academy envisaged to identify a million grass root knowledge workers who will b% enlisted as fellows of the academy
the programme provides an info-kiosk pc with internet and video conferencing facility scanner photocopier etc at a low cost and trains kiosk owner the owner then provides different services and tries to earn a reasonable income
the government of india has decided to join the alliance by providing financial support of rs
due to these problems an eco-friendly technology is required
produce pesticide free and produced in an environmendy sustainable way
therefore small and marginal formers may find it difficult to adapt to large scale production
it is the sum total of skill and expertise
 human capital formation it is the process of adding to the stock of human capital over time
 physical capital it refers to the stock of produced means of production
it consists of machines production plants etc
sources of human capital formation  expenditure on education  expenditure on health  on-the-job training  study programmes for adults  migration  expenditure on information human capital formation and economic growth  higher productivity of physical capital human capital formation increases productivity of physical capital specialised engineers and skilled workers can certainly handle machines better than the other
 innovative skills it facilitates the use and growth of innovative skills
innovation is the life line of growth
 higher rate of participation and equality by enhancing productive capacities of the labour force human capital formation induces greater employment
thus there is a cause and effect relationship between human capital formation and economic growth
problems facing by human capital formation in india  rising population  brain drain  desicient man power planning  law academic standards human capital and human development human capital and human development are related concepts but certainly not identical
human capital is a means to an end
human development is an end itself
education as an essential element of human resource development it implies the process of teaching training and learning especially in schools or colleges to improve knowledge and develop skills
large number of illiterates  inadequate vocationalisation  gender bias  low rural access level  privatisation  low government expenditure on education right to education rte in the year  the government of india has brought about an act called rte
it promises education to all
it makes education a matter of right to all children in the age group of - years
it also deals with the relationship among human capital economic growth and human development
concepts and sources of human capital formation just as a country can turn physical resources like land into physical capital like factories similarly it can also turn human resources like students into engineers and doctors
there by increasing their productivity and efficiency
so human capital formation aims at converting human resources into human assets
human capital and physical capital  human capital it refers to the stock of skill ability expertise education and knowledge in a nation at a point of time
 physical capital all inputs which are required for further production such as machine tools and implements factory buildings etc are called physical capital
in other words human capital formation is the process of adding to the stock of human capital over time
meier defines human capital formation as “human capital formation is the process of acquiring and increasing the number of persons who have the skiff education and experience which are essential for the economic and political development of a country”
sources of human capital formation investment in education is considered as one of the most important sources of human capital formation
there are several other sources as well
investment in health on-the-job training migration and information are the other sources of human capital formation
these sources are discussed below 
expenditure on education the education expenditure is an important source of human capital formation as it is the most effective way on enhancing and enlarging a productive workforce in the country
nations and individuals invest in education with the objective  increasing their future income
 generating technical skills and creating manpower well suited for improving labour productivity and thus sustaining rapid economic development
 tending to bring down birth rate which in turn brings decline in population growth rate
it makes more resources available per person
 education also results in social benefits since it also spreads to others
expenditure on health health is another important source of human capital formation
a sick labourer without access to medical facilities is compelled to abstain from work and there in a loss of productivity
the various forms of health expenditure are preventive medicine curative medicine social medicine provision of clean drinking water etc
on-the-job training expenditure regarding on-the-job training is a source of human capital formation as the return of such expenditure in the form of enhanced labour productivity is more than the cost of it
firms spend huge amounts on giving on-the-job training to their workers
it may be in different forms like a worker may be trained in the firm itself or under the supervision of a skilled worker or can be sent for off campus training
the firms then insist that workers should work for atleast some time in die company so that they can recover the benefits of the enhanced productivity owing to the training
migration people sometimes migrate from one place to the other in search of better jobs that fetch them higher salaries than what they may get in their native places
it includes migration of people from rural areas to urban areas in india
unemployment is the reason for the rural urban migration in india and technically qualified people migrate from one country to another in order to get high salaries
expenditure on information people spent to acquire information relating to the labour market and other markets like education health etc
for example people seek information regarding salaries and other facilities available in different labour markets so that they can choose the right job
expenditure incurred for acquiring information regarding labour markets and other markets like education and health have also becomes an important source of human capital formation
economic growth and state of human capita formation in intiter human capital and economic growth india recognised the importance of human capital in economic growth long ago
the seventh five year plan says ‘human resources development has necessarily to be assigned a key role in any development strategy particularly in a country with a large population’
the following points show clearly the interdependence among the two  higher productivity of physical capital human capital increases productivity of physical capital as specialised and skilled workers can handle machines or techniques better than the unskilled works
this increased productivity and hence production in leads to economic growth
 innovative skills human capital facilitates innovation of new methods of production and this increase the rate of economic growth in the form of increase in gdp
 higher rate of participation and equality human capital formation leads to a higher employment rate
with increase in employment the productivity rises
also increase in employment opportunities also increases the level of income and this helps in reducing inequalities of wealth
both increase in employment rate and decrease in income inequalities are pointers of economic development
india as a knowledge economy the indian software industry has been showing an impressive record over the past decade
entrepreneurs bureaucrats and politicians are now advancing views about how india can transform itself into a knowledge-based economy by using information technology it
there have been some instances of villagers using e-mail which are cited as examples of such transformation
likewise e-governance is being projected as the way of the future
the value of it depends greatly on the existing level of economic development
human capital and human development human development is the broader term than human capital
human capital considers education and health as a means to increase labour productivity
human development is based on the idea that education and health are integral to human well-being because when people have the ability to read and write and the ability to lead a long and healthy life they will be able to make other choices they value
in human capital view any investment in education and health is unproductive if it-does not enhance output of goods and services
in the human development perspective human beings are ends in themselves
therefore basic education and basic health are important in themselves irrespective of their contribution to labour productivity
deutsche bank and world bank report on indian economy
 according to two independent reports one from deutsche and other from world bank have identified that india would grow faster due to its strength in human capital formation
 according to deutsche bank a german bank’s report on global growth centres it has been identified tha india will emerge as one among four major growth centres in the world by 
this report also says that between  to  we expect a % rise in the average years of education in india to just above  years
 world’s bank report india and the knowledge economy-leveraging strengths and opportunities states that india should make a transition to the knowledge economy and if it uses its knowledge as much as ireland does then the per capita income of india will increase from a little over us $ in  to us $ in 
 it further states that the indian economy has all the key ingredients for making this transition such as a critical mass of skilled workers a well functioning democracy and a diversified science and technology infrastructure
thus two reports point out the fact that further human capital formation in india will move its economy to a higher growth
problems of human capital formation in india the main problems of human capital formation in india are  rising population rapidly rising population adversely affects the quality of human capital in under developed and developing countries like india
it reduces per head availability of existing facilities like sanitation employment drainage water system housing hospitals education food supply nutrition roads electricity etc
this slow down the process of human capital formation in the domestic economy
 inefficient of manpower planning there is inefficient manpower planning in less developed countries where no efforts have been made either to raise the standard of education at different stages pr to maintain the demand and supply of technical labour force
it is a sad reflection on the wastage of human power and human skill
 long-term process the process of human development is a long-term policy because skill formation takes time
the process which produces skilled manpower is thus slow
this also lowers our competitiveness in the international market of human capital
 high poverty levels a large proportion of the population lives below poverty line and do not have access to basic health and educational facilities
a large section of society cannot afford to get higher education or expensive medical treatment for major disease
human developent index the human developent index hdi is a composite statistic of life expectance education and income indices rank countries into four tiers of human development
it was created by economist mahbub ul haq followed by economist amartya sen in  and published by the united nations development programme
india has th position in the world human development index
education sector in india education implies the process of teaching training and learning especially in schools or colleges to improve knowledge and develop skills
following points explain the important or objective of education  it produces good citizens
 it develops science and technology
 it facilities use of natural and human resources of all regions of the country
 it expands mental horizon of the people
growth in government expenditure on education government expenditure on education can be expressed in two ways  as a percentage of‘total government expenditure
 as a percentage of gross domestic product gdp
the percentage of ‘education expenditure of total government expenditure’ indicates the importance of education in the scheme of expenses before the government
expenditure on education out of our gdp shows how much we are committed towards the development of education in our country
during - education expenditure as percentage of total government expenditure increased from
% and as percentage of gdp increased from 
during this period expenditure on education was not constant
there was irregular rise and fell
but expenditure per student on tertiary education is higher than that of elementary
as we expand school education we need more teachers who are trained in the higher educational institutions therefore expenditure on all levels of education should be increased
the per capita education expenditure is as high as rs
 in himachal pradesh to as low as rs
this leads to differences in educational opportunities across states
free and compulsory education the education commission - had recommended that atleast % of gdp to be spent on education so as to make a noticeable rate of growth in education
in december  the government of india through the th amendment of the constitution of india made free and compulsory education a fundamental right of all children in the age group of -  years
government of india in year  appointed
the tapas majumdar committee which estimated an expenditure of around 
 lakh crore over  years - to - to bring all indian children in the age group of - years under the purview of school education
desired level of expenditure an education is % of gdp but the current level is little over % which is not inadequate
it is necessary to reach the level of % which is considered as must for coming years
recently government of india has started levying a % ‘education cess’ on all union taxes
the revenues from education cess has been earmarked for spending on elementary education
educational achievements in india generally educational achievements in a country are indicated in terms of  adult literacy level  primary education completion rate  youth literacy rate these statistics for the years  to  are given in the following table future prospects india government considers education a key sector where considerable growth and
thus it has set some future prospects for framing its policies
these prospects are discussed below education for all  still a distant dream although the education level in india has risen for both adults as well as for youth
still the number of illiterates in india are as much as the population was at the time of independence
the following factors makes education still a distant dream  large number of illiterates  inadequate vocationalisation  gender bias  low rural access level  privatisation  low government expenditure on education gender equity  better than before the differences in literacy rates between males and females are narrowing signifying a positive development in gender equity still the need to promote education for women in india is imminent for various reasons such as  improving economic independence
 social status of women
 healthcare of women and children
therefore we cannot show the satisfaction about the upward movement in literacy rates as we have miles to go in achieving cent percent adult literacy
in india mizoram kerala goa and delhi are the states having high literacy rate while bihar uttar pradesh rajasthan and arunachal pradesh are the educationally backward states
the educational backwardness is due to social and economic poverty of the people
higher education  a few takers the indian education pyramid is steep indicating lesser and lesser number of people reaching the higher education level
% whereas the rate of unemployment for youth with education up to primary level was only 
he is engaged in some production activity
employed are those who are engaged in some production activity or the other
 self-employed and hired worker self-employed workers are those who are engaged in their own business or own profession
hired workers are those who work for others they renders their services to other as a reward get wagessalaries or may be they are paid in kind
 casual and regular worker casual workers are the daily wagers
they are not hired by their employers on regular basis
regular workers are permanent pay-roll of their employers
a regular worker is usually a skilled worker
 labour supply it refers to supply of labour corresponding to different wage rates
supply of labour is measured in terms of man-days of work and always studied with reference to wage rate
 labour force it refers to the number of persons actually working or willing to work
it is not related to wage rate
 work force it refers to the number of persons actually working and does not account for those who are willing to work
 employment in firms factories and offices in the course of economic development of a country labour force from agriculture and other related activities to industry and services
in this process workers migrate from rural to urban areas
 informalisation of workforce it refers to a situation where percentage of work force in the formal sector tends to decline and that in the informal sector tends to rise
market economy and informalisation of workers perhaps are strongly correlated to each other
unemployment according to prof pigou “a man is unemployed only when he is both without a job a or not employed and also desires to be employed”
 rural unemployment in indian villages nearly 
% of labourers are engaged in primary sector
most of the rural labourers engaged in non-farm sector work in cottage industries
 urban unemployment in urban areas unemployed people are often registered with employment exchanges
therefore urban unemployment is more like open unemployment
rural employment guarantee scheme is a significant recent attempt of the government offering guaranteed employment to those in the rural areas who are below poverty line
it also addresses the growth rate of indian economy and various employment generation schemes
it also specifies the need of transformation of workers from in formal sector to formal sector
employment and informalisation of indian workforce work plays an important role in our lives as an individual or a group of members can earn their living after doing work
being employed gives us a sense of self-worth and enables us to relate ourselves meaningfully with others
in this way every working person can actively contribute towards national income
thus there is need to know who is a worker and what is an employment
a person is classed as a worker if  he has contract or agreement to do work
 he gets reward or other benefits from doing a work
 he works for himself or is self-employed
so it can be concluded that all those who are engaged in production activities in whatever capacity high or low are workers
” types of workers broadly workers can be categorised into self-employed and hired workers
they are discussed below  self-employed the workers who own and operate an enterprise to earn their livelihood are known as self-employed
for example a farmer working on his own farm
this category accounts for more than % of the workforce
hired workers can be of two types  casual workers those people who are not hired by their employers on a regularpermanent basis and do not get social security benefits are said to be casual workers
 regular salaried workers when a worker is engaged by someone or by an enterprise and paid his or her wages on a regular basis they are known as regular salaried employees or regular workers
for example teachers chartered accountants etc
self-employed and hired workers in india 
according to region rural and urban  % of workers are self-employed and % of workers are hired in urban areas
 % of workers are self-employed and % of workers are hired in rural areas
the above chart shows that the self-employed and casual wage labourers are found more in rural areas than in urban areas
it is -because in urban areas people are skilled and work for jobs in offices and factories
but in rural areas people work on their own farms
according to gender  % of male workers are self-employed and % of male workers are hired
 % of female workers are self-employed and % of female workers are hired
but female workers give preference to self- employment than to hired employment
it is because women both in rural and urban areas are less mobile and thus prefer to engage themselves in self employment
so it can be concluded that self-employment is a very important source of livelihood for people in india
size of workforce in india
india has a workforce of nearly  crore of people
the data on the size of workforce in india are as follows  about % of the workforce comprises of male workers only % are female workers  nearly % of workforce is found in rural areas i and only % is in urban areas
 percentage of female workforce in rural areas is nearly % while it is only % in urban areas
employment it is a relationship between two parties i
employer and the employee who are binded in a contract of doing something valuable or it is an act of employing or state of being employed
the nature of employment in india is multifaceted
some get employment throughout the year or some others get employed for only a few months in a year
many workers do not get fair wages for their work but still while estimating the numbers of workers all those who are engaged in productive activities are included as employed
terms associated with workers and employment are accumulated below  productive activities those activities which contribute to the gross national product are called productive activities
 workforce persons who are engaged in productive activities are termed as workers and they constitute the workforce
workforce is the total number of persons actually working
 workforce participation rate ratio it is measured as the ratio between workforce and total population of a country
 labour force it refers to he number of workers actually working or who are able to work
it is not related to wage rate
 rate of unemployment participation of people in employment it refers to participation of people induction activity
it is measured as a ratio of or force to total population of the country
the data on rate of participation of people in employment are as follows  rate of participation for the urban areas is about %
 rate of participation for the rural areas is about %
 in urban areas rate of participation is about 
% for men and 
 in rural areas rate of participation is about 
% for men and 
 overall rate of participation in the country is about 
worker-population ratio in india - worker-population ratio the above data reveals the following  overall rate of participation in the country is not very high implying not many people are engaged in production activity
 participation rate in rural areas is higher than in urban areas
 participation rate for women is higher in rural areas compared with urban areas
in this process workers migrate from rural to urban areas
generally we divide all productive activities into different industrial divisions they are as follows  primary sector it includes agriculture forestry and logging ashing mining and quarrying
 secondary sector it includes manufacturing construction electricity gas and water supply
 tertiary sector it includes trade transport storage and services
growth and changing structure of employment during the period - gross domestic product gdp of india grew positively and was higher than the employment growth
however there was always fluctuation in the growth of gdp
during this period employment grew at a stable rate of about %
in - about % of workforce was engaged in primary sector and in - this proportion has declined to %
secondary and service sectors are showing promising future for the indian workforce
yet self-employment continues to be the major employment provider
the movement of labour from regular workers to casual wage workers is known as the process of casualization
the chart given above points that in the late s employment growth started declining and reached the level of growth that india had in the early stages of planning
during these years there is a widening gap between the growth of gdp and employment
this means that in the indian economy without generating employment we have been able to produce more goods and services
this phenomenon is referred as jobless growth
distribution of workforce by industrial sectors shows substantial shift from farm work to non-farm work
informalisation of indian workforce development planning in india is always focused to provide decent livelihood to its people
it was thought that the industrialisation strategy would bring surplus workers from agriculture to industry with better standard of living as in developed countries
over the years the quality of employment has been deteriorating
a small section of indian workforce is getting regular income
the government through its labour laws enable them to protect rights in various ways
this section of workforce forms trade unions bargains with employers for better wages and other social security measures
workforce can be classified into two categories formal sectors all the public sector establishments and those private sector establishments which employ  hired workers or more are called formal sector establishments and those who work in such establishments are formal sector workers
informal sectors all other enterprises and workers working in those enterprises form the informal sector
those who are working in the formal sector enjoy social security benefits
they earn more than those in the informal sector
workers and enterprises in the informal sector do not get regular income they do not have any protection or regulation from the government
workers are dismissed without any compensation
as the economy will grow more and more workers would become formal sector workers
informalisation in ahmedabad ahmedabad is a prosperous city with its wealth based on the produce of more than  textile mills with a labour force of  workers employed in them
these workers had over the course of the century acquired a certain degree of income security
they had secure jobs with a living wage they were covered by social security schemes protecting their health and old age
they had a strong trade union which not only represented them in disputes but also ran activities for the welfare of workers and their families
in the early s textile mills all over the country began to close down
in some places such as mumbai the mills closed rapidly
in ahmedabad the process of closure was long drawn out and spread over  years
over this period approximately over  permanent workers and over  non-permanent workers lost their jobs and were driven to the informal sector
the city experienced an economic recession and public disturbances especially communal riots
a whole class of workers was thrown back from the middle class into the infor mal sector into poverty
unemployment in every section of society there will be a large number of unemployed persons
it is a situation in which all those who owing to lack of work are not working but either seek work through employment exchanges intermediaries friends or relatives or by making applications to prospective employers or express their willingness or availability for work under the prevailing condition of work and remunerations
there are a variety of ways by which an unemployed person is identified
as per the view f some economists unemployed person is one who is not able to get employment of even one hour in half a day
rural unemployment around % of india’s population lives in village
agriculture is the single largest source of their livelihood
agriculture suffers from a number of problems like dependence upon rainfall financial constraints obsolete techniques etc
rural unemployment can be of following three types  open unemployment it refers to that situation wherein the worker is willing to work and has the necessary ability to work yet he does not get work and remains unemployed for full time
”  seasonal unemployment it refers to a situation where a number of a persons are not able to find a job in a particular season
it occurs in case of agriculture ice-cream factories woollens factories etc
 disguised unemployment it exists when marginal physical productivity of labour is zero or sometimes it becomes negative
important features of disguised unemployment are as under  marginal physical productivity of labour is zero
 there is disguised unemployment among wage earners
 disguised unemployment is invisible
 it is different from industrial unemployment
urban unemployment in urban areas unemployed people are often registered with employment exchanges
between  and  the number of unemployed registered in employment exchanges has increased more than eight-fold
urban unemployment is of three types  industrial unemployment it includes those illiterate persons who are willing to work in industries mining transport trade and construction activities etc
 educated unemployment in india the problem of unemployment among the educated people is also quite grave
it is a problem spread across all parts of the country because the massive expansion of the education facilities have contributed to the growth of educated persons who are on the look out for white collar jobs
 technological unemployment technological upgradation is taking place in all spheres of activity
people who have not updated their skills in the latest technology become technologically unemployed
causes of unemployment in india 
slow economic growth in indian economy the rate of economic growth is very slow
this slow growth rate fails to provide enough employment opportunities to the rising population
supply of labour is much more than the available employment opportunities
rapid growth of population constant increase in population has been a grave problem of india
it is one of the main causes of unemployment
the number of unemployed has actually increased instead of decreasing during the plan period
faulty employment planning the five year plans in india have not been designed for employment generation
a frontal attack to solve the problem of unemployment is missing
it was thought that economic growth will take care of unemployment problem
excessive use of foreign technology lack of scientific and technical cosearch at home due to its high cost has resulted in excessive use of foreign technology which has led to technical unemployment in our country
 lack of financial resources the expansion and diversification programme of agriculture and small scale industries have suffered because of lack of financial resources
this has been accompained by increasing government control of economic activities
increase in labour force the population explosion stage of indian economy has added young people to the labour force who are seeking employment
government and employment generation in  the government had passed an act in parliament known as the national rural employment guarantee act 
it promises  days of guaranteed wage employment to all rural households who volunteer to do unskilled manual work
this scheme is one of the important measure adopted by government to generate employment for those who are in need of jobs in rural areas
since independence the union and state government have played an important role in generating employment or creating opportunities for employment generation
their efforts can be broadly categorised into two i
 direct employment in this government employs people in various departments for administrative purposes
it also runs industries hotels and transport companies and hence provides employment directly to workers
 indirect employment it can be understood as when output of goods and services from government enterprises increases then private enterprises which receive now materials from government enterprises will also raise their output and hence increase the number of employment opportunities in the economy
this is the indirect generation of employment opportunities by the government initiatives in the economy
these programmes aim at providing not only employment but also services in areas such as primary health primary education rural drinking water nutrition assistance for people to buy income and employment generating assets development of community assets by generating wage employment construction of houses and sanitation assistance for constructing houses laying of rural roads development of waste landsdegraded lands
economic infrastructure it refers to all such elements of economic change which serve as a support system to the process of economic growth
social infrastructure it refers to the core elements of social change which serve as a support system for the process of social development of a country
infrastructure and development following observations show how exactly infrastructure contributes to the process of growth and development
 infrastructure impacts productivity  infrastructure induces investment  infrastructure generates linkages in production  infrastructure enhances size of the market  enhance ability to work  induces foreign direct invesment fdi the state of infrastructure in india i energy energy is the most important component of economic infrastructure
industrial production is not possible if energy is not available
energy is broadly classified as commercial and non-commercial energy
 components of commercial energy coal petroleum products natural gas electricity
 components of non-commercial energy fire wood animal waste agricultural waste
v some challenges in the power sector  inadequate generation of electricity  less capacity utilisation  losses of electricity boards vi health health is a state of complete physical mental and social well-being
it does not simply mean absence of disease rather it means a sound physical and mental state of the individual
development of health services after independence there has been a large scale improvement in health facilities
following are the highlights  decline in death rate  reduction in infant mortality  rise in expectancy of life  control over deadly diseases  reduction in child mortality rate women’s health women in india suffer from a serious neglect not only in the area of education but in the area of health care as well
more than % of women in india in the age group of - years suffer from nutritional deficiency
health as an emerging challenge points given below highlight the deficiencies of our social infrastructure in terms of health facilities
it contributes to economic development of a country both by rising the productivity of factors of production and by improving the quality of life of its people
the significance of infrastructure in the context of growth and development of an economy is also discussed in it
it provides supporting services in the main areas of industrial and agricultural production domestic and foreign trade and commerce
infrastructural installations do not direcdy produce goods but help in promoting production activities in an economy
transport communication banking power etc
these services include roads railways ports airports dams power stations oil and gas pipelines telecommunication facilities etc
they also include country’s educational system including schools and colleges health system including hospitals sanitary system including clean drinking water facilities and the monetary system including banks insurance and other financial institutions
types of infrastructure infrastructure is broadly categorised as social and economic infrastructure
they are discussed below social infrastructure it refers to the core elements of social change which serve as a foundation for the process of social development of a country
it contributes to economic processes indirectly and from outside the system of production and distribution e
educational institutions hospitals sanitary conditions and housing facilities etc
economic infrastructure it refers to all such elements of economic change which serve as a foundation for the process of economic growth
these helps in the process of production directly
modem agriculture also largely depends on it  for speedy and large scale transportation of seeds pesticides fertilisers etc
we use modern roadways railways and shipping i facilities
in recent times agriculture also depends on insurance and banking system
inadequate infrastructure can have multiple adverse effects on health
improvements in water supply and – sanitation have a large impact by reducing morbidity state of being unhealthy or diseased from major  waterborne diseases and reducing the severity of disease when it occurs
air pollution and safety hazards connected to transportation also effect morbidity particularly in densely populated areas
importance of infrastructure in development folloiving points highlights how exactly infrastructure contributes to the process of growth and development  impact on productivity infrastructure plays an major role in the raising productivity with improved roadways warehouses etc farmers can easily sell their products in different markets
also irrigation facilities has reduced dependence on monsoon for water needs which not only increases productivity but also production level
 induces investment infrastructure induces investment
low investment points to low level of production and backwardness of an economy
a well developed infrastructure attracts foreign investors
which gives investment avenues and profitable ventures
 generates linkages in production better means of transport and communication robust system of banking and finance generates better inter-industrial linkages
it is a situation when expansion of one industry facilitates the expansion of the other
 enhances size of the market infrastructure enhances the size of the market as large scale of production can capture more market
 enhances ability to work social infrastructure increases the quality of life of workers thereby increasing their efficiency
health care centres educational institutions and other such facilities inherit skills which increases ability and efficiency to work
 facilities outsourcing india is emerging to be a global destination for all kinds of outsourcing
for example call centres study centres medical  transcription and such other services owing largely – to its sound system of social and economic infrastructure
the state of infrastructure in india traditionally the government has been solely responsible for developing the country’s infrastructure
but it was found that the government’s investment in infrastructure was inadequate
today the private sector by itself and also in joint partnership with the public sector has started playing a very important role in infrastructure development
india invests only % of its gdp on infrastructure which is for below than that of china and indonesia
infrastructure state in rural india can be understood from the following points  despite of so much technological progress women of rural india are still using bio fuels to meet their daily energy requirement
 women go long distances to fetch water and other basic needs
 the census  shows that in rural india only % households have an electricity connection and % still use kerosene
 about % of the rural households use bio fuels for cooking
 tap water availability is limited to only % rural households
 about % of the population drinks water from open resources such as wells ponds etc
 access to improved sanitation in rural areas was only %
future prospects in india some economists have projected that india will become the third biggest economy in the world a few decades from now
for that to happen india will have to boost its infrastructure investment
in an economy as the income rises requirement of infrastructure will change
for low income countries basic infrastructure services like irrigation transport and power are more important
on the contrary the developed economies require more service related to infrastructure
that is why share of power and telecommunication infrastructure is greater in high income countries
thus development of infrastructure and economic development go hand in hand
obviously if proper attention is not paid to infrastructure development economic development will be severely affected
other types of infrastructure are not included in our syllabus
energy energy is a critical aspect of development process of a nation
it is essential for industries agriculture and related areas like production and transportation of fertilisers pesticides and farm equipment
it is also required in house for cooking household lighting and heating etc
conventional sources of energy there are two types of conventional sources of energy  commercial sources coal petroleum and electricity are commercial sources of energy as they bought and sold in the market
they account for over % of total energy sources consumed in india
commercial sources of energy are generally exhaustible in nature
 non-commercial sources fire wood agricultural waste and dried dung non-commercial sources of energy
they are found in nature free of cost
non-commercial sources are generally renewable in nature
more then % of indian households depend on the traditional sources of energy
in meeting their regular cooking and heating needs
non-conventional sources of energy solar energy wind energy and tidal power are non-conventional sources
india has almost unlimited potential for producing all three types of energy if some appropriate cost effective technologies that are already available are used
note india is fifth largest producer of wind energy
difference between conventional and non-conventional sources of energy conventional sources of energy these are the traditional sources of energy which are generally bought and sold in the market
in india conventional sources are being used in total disregard to the environment i
primary and final sources of energy primary sources they are those sources which are the gift of nature to the earth
they do not require any transformation before their use
they are directly used as the inputs of production
 coal lignite petroleum gas etc
final sources they sources are used as a final product
this involves transformation process transforming inputs into final outputs like transformation of coal energy into electricity
consumption pattern of commercial energy in india at present commercial energy consumption makes up about % of the total energy consumed in india
this includes coal with the largest share of % followed by oil at % natural gas at % and hydro energy at %
non-commercial energy sources account for over % ofthe total energy consumption
sectoral pattern of energy consumption in india earlier till - transport sector was the largest consumer of commercial energy but it declined thereafter and industrial sector has been increasing
the share of oil and gas is highest among all commercial energy consumption
powerelectricity the most visible form of energy which is often identified with progress in modern civilisation is power commonly called electricity
it is a critical component of infrastructure that determines the economic development of a country
the growth rate of demand for power is generally higher than the gdp growth rate
studies point that in order to have % per annum power supply needs to grow around 
in - thermal sources accounted for almost % generation capacity in india
hydel and wind power accounted for 
% while nuclear power accounted only 
india’s energy policy encourages two energy sources hydel and wind as they do not rely on fossil fuel and hence avoid carbon emissions and are renewable in nature
it has resulted in faster growth of electricity produced from there two sources
atomic energy is an important source of electric power
at present nuclear energy accounts for only 
% of total energy consumption against a global average of % which is too low
hence some scholars suggest to generate more electricity through atomic sources
use of solar energy in thane there is a use of solar energy on large scale in thane city
the use of solar energy which was considered a somewhat far fetched concept has bought in real benefits and results in cost and energy saving in this city solar energy is being applied to heat water power traffic signals and advertising hoardings the experiment is lead by thane municipal corporation
it has made compulsory for all new buildings in the city to install solar water heating system
some challenges in the power sector energy in a developing country like india is a basic put required to sustain economic growth and to provide basic amenities of life to the entire population of a country
some of the challenges that india’s power sector faces today are  india’s installed capacity to generate electricity is  not sufficient to feed an annual economic growth of %
at present india is able to and only  mw a year
even the installed capacity is under utilised
 state electricity boards sebs which distribute electricity incur losses which exceed   billion due to transmission and loss in distribution wrong pricing of electricity and other inefficiences
 private sector power generators are yet to play their role in a major way same is the case with foreign investors
 there is general public unrest due to high power tariffs and prolonged power cuts in different parts of the country
 thermal power plants which are the mainstay of india’s power sector are facing shortage of raw material and coal supplies
continued economic development and raising population is driving the demand for more energy than what india is currendy producing
instead of investing in already installed power sector government has shifted interest into the private sector particularly for the distribution of electricity at much higher prices
power distribution  the case of delhi since independence power management in the capital has changed hands four times
the delhi state electricity board dseb was set up in 
this was succeeded by the delhi electric supply undertaking desu in 
the delhi vidyut board dvb came into existence as seb in february 
now the distirbutioq of electricity vests with two leading private sector companies—reliance energy limited bses rajdhani power limited and bses yamuna power limited and tata—power limited tpddl
they supply electricity to approximately  lakh customers in delhi
the tariff structure and other regulatory issues are monitored by the delhi electricity regulatory commission derc
though it was expected that there will be greater improvement in power distribution and the consumers will benefit in a major way experience shows unsatisfactory results
health a person’s ability to work depends largely on his health
good health enhances the quality of life
health is not only absence of disease but also the ability to realise one’s potential
it is a yardstick of one’s well being
health is an important component of social infrastructure
it is the holistic process related to the overall growth and development of the nation
scholars assess people’s health by taking into account indicators like infant mortality and maternal mortality rate life expectancy and nutrition levels alongwith incidence of communicable and non-communicable diseases
development of health infrastructure ensures a country about healthy manpower for production of goods and services
only the presence of infrastructure is not enough to have healthy people but it should be accessable to all the people easily
state of health infrastructure in india the government has the constitutional obligation to guide and regulate all health related issues such as medical education adulteration of food drugs and poisons medical profession vital statistics mental deficiency and lunacy
central council of health and family welfare collects information and renders financial and technical assistance to state governments union territories and other bodies for implementation of important health programmes in the country
state of health infrastructure in india can be understood from the following points  at the village level a variety of hospitals known as primary health centres phcs have been set
 there are large number of hospitals run by voluntary agencies and the private sector equipped with professionals and para medicaf professionals trained in medical pharmacy and nursing colleges
 since independence there has been a significant expansion in the physical provision of health services
public health infrastructure in india - private sector health infrastructure in recent time private health infrastructure has grown largely
private sector health infrastructure is explained below about % of the hospitals running in india belong to private sector
nearly % of dispensaries are run by the same private sector
private sector has also been contributing significantly in medical education and training medical technologies and diagnostics manufacture and sale of pharmaceuticals hospital construction and medical services
health system in india india’s health infrastructure and healthcare is made up of a three tier system 
 promotion of food supply and proper nutrition and adequate supply of water and basic sanitation
 maternal and child health care
 immunisation against major infectious diseases and injuries
 promotion of health and provision of essential drugs
auxiliary nursing midwife anm is the first person who provides primary healthcare
primary health centres phcs community health centres chcs and sub centres
secondary healthcare when condition of a patient is not managed by phcs they are referred to secondary or tertiary hospitals
health care institutes having better facilities for surgery x-ray ecg electro cardio graph are called secondary healthcare institutes
they function both as primary health care provider and also provide better health care facilities
they are mostly located in district and headquarters in big towns
tertiary healthcare in tertiary sector there are the hospitals which have advanced level equipment and medicines and undertake all the complicated health problems which could not be managed by primary and secondary hospitals
this sector also includes many premier institutes which not only impart quality medical education and conduct research but also provide specialised health care
for example all india institute of medical sciences aiimss post graduate institute pgi chandigarh jawaharlal institute of postgraduate medical education and research jipmer pondicherry national institute of mental health and neuro sciences nimhnss banglore and all india institute of hygiene and public health kolkata
indian systems of medicine asm it includes six systems ayurveda yoga unani siddha naturopathy and homeopathy ayusnh
at present there are  ism hospitals  dispensaries and as 
 lakhs registered practitioners in india
medical tourism – a great opportunity now-a-days foreigners visit india for surgeriesliver transplants dental and even cosmetic care etc the reason is our health gervices combine latest medical technologies with qualified professionals and is cheaper for foreigners as compared to costs of similar health careaervices in their own countries
in - as many as  foreigners visited india for medical treatment this figure is likely to increase by % each year
health infrastructure can be upgraded to attract more foreigners to india
ism has huge potential and can solve a large part of our health care problems because they are effective safe and inexpensive
scholars argue that there is greater scope for the role of government in the health sector
source world health statistics 
this is very low as compared to other countries both developing and developed
 india has about % of the world’s population but it bears a frightening % of the global burden of diseases
 global burden of diseases gbd is an indicator used by experts to gauge the number of people dying prematurely due to a particular disease as well as the number of years spent by them in state of‘disability’ owing to the disease
 every year around five lakh children die due to water borne diseases
the danger of aids is also looming large
 malnutrition and inadequate supply of vaccines lead to the death of 
 million children every year
 at present less than % c the population utilises public health facilities
 only % of phc’s have quired number of doctors and only % of phc’s have suttk stock of medicines
urban-rural and poor-rich divide differences in medical healthcare between urban – rural and poor-rich can be understood from the points given below  only one-fifth of total hospitals are located in rural areas
rural india has about half the number of dispensaries
people in rural areas do not have sufficient medical infrasctructure
this lead to difference in the health status of people
out of  lakhs beds roughly % are available in rural areas
 there are only 
% hospital for every one lakh people in rural areas while urban areas have 
% hospitals for the same number of people
even though  recognised medical colleges produce  medical graduates every year
still there is shortage of doctors in rural areas
one-fifth of these doctors migrate from one coutry to -another for better job opportunities
 the poorest % of indians living in both urban and rural areas spend % of their income on healthcare while the rich spend only %
 percentage of people who have no access to proper care has risen from  in  to  in 
women’s health women constitute about half the total population in india
they suffer many disadvantages as compared to men in the areas of education participation in economic activities and health care
the child sex ratio has been detonated from  in  to  in 
there is growing incidence of female foeticide in the country
close to  girls under the age of  are not only married but have already borne children at least once
more than % of married women between the age group of  and  years suffer from anaemia caused by iron deficiency
it has contributed to % of maternal deaths
abortions are major cause of maternal morbidity and mortality in india
health  a vital public good and a basic human right all citizens can get better health facilities if public health services are decentralised
success against diseases depends on education and efficient health infrastructure
so it is necessary to create awareness on health and provide efficient system
the role of telecom and it in this regard is very important
the ultimate goal should be to help people move towards a better quality of life
it is the sum total of surrounding and the totality of the resources
functions of environment  it assimilates waste
 it sustains life by providing genetic and bio diversity
 it also provides aesthetic services like scenery etc
significance of environment  environment offers resources for production
 environment enhance quality of life
two basic problems related to environment  problem of pollution
 problem of excessive exploitation of natural resources
pollution it refers to those activities of production and consumption which challenge purity of air and water and serenity of the environment
pollution unfolds itself in three ways  air pollution pollution of air impliespollution of an essential elements of life
 water pollution water is an equally important element of life and its pollution is equally serious
polluted water is the principal cause of diseases like diarrhoea and hepatities
 noise pollution excessive noise causes irritation and unnecessarily fatigues the body and the mind
features of sustainable development  sustained rise in real per capita income and economic welfare  rational use of natural resources  no reduction in the ability of future generations to meet their own needs  no increase in pollution strategies for sustainable development  input-efficient technology
 use of environment-friendly sources of energy
 stringent laws on the disposal of chimical effluents
 awarness to conserve natural assets for inter-generational equity
 public means of transport
factors contributing to deforestation  growing industrial demand for wood and other forest products
 growing demand for wood owing to explosive rise in population
the economic development we have achieved so far is on the cost of environmental degradation
the era of globlisation promises higher economic growth but on the same side it had adverse consequences that had impacted environment
in order to understand the sustainable path of development the significance and contribution of environment to economic development should be understood
with this in mind we would be able to achieve sustainable development in india
environment is defined as the total planetary inheritance and the totality of all resources
it includes all the biotic e
birds animals plants forests etc and abiotic e
 water sun land mountains etc factors that influence each other
functions of environment environment performs four vital junctions which are as follows  supply resources resources include both renewable and non-renewable sources of energy
resources which can be used without any fear of getting depleted are renewable sources of energy e
non-renewable sources are those which are getting depleted or exhausted
 assimilates waste production and consumption activity generates wastes
it is generally in form of garbage which is absorbed by the environment
 sustains life sun soil air water are the essential ingredients of environment for the human life
absence of these will lead to an end of life on the earth
 aesthetic services environment provides aesthetic services like scenery which includes rivers ocean mountains and deserts
enjoying these surroundings adds to the quality of life
environmental crisis the environment is performing its functions without any interruption as long as the demand of these functions is within its carrying capacity
this means that if the rate of extraction of resources will be above the rate of their regeneration the environment will fail to perform its functions
resources are becoming extinct and wastes are generated beyond the absorptive capacity of the environment
all this has lead to the environmental crisis it refers to ecological crisis that occurs when the environment of a species or a population changes and destabalises its survival
consequence of environmental crisis the points given below describe the consequences of environmental crisis  development has polluted and dried up rivers and other aquifers which was deteriorated the quality of water
 intensive and extensive excavation of both renewable and non-renewable resources has exhausted some of the vital resources compelling to spend a huge amount of money on technology and research to explore new resources
 decline in air and water quality have resulted in increased number of respiratory and water borne diseases i
 expenditure of health care is also rising according to a data % of water of
india is polluted which cannot be used for drinking purpose
global environmental issues the environmental issues which affect the whole world are called global environmental issues such as global warming and ozone depletion
these issues also contribute to increased financial commitments for the government
these issues are discussed below 
global warming the gradual increase in the average temperature of earth’s lower atmosphere is called global warming
much of the recent observed and projected global warming is human induced
the atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane have increased by % and % respectively above pre-industrial level since 
different effects of global warming are described below  during the past century the atmospheric temperature has risen by 
 melting of polar ice resulting in increase in sea level during the past century sea level has risen by several inches and the risk of coastal flooding has increased
 disruption of drinking water supplies dependent of snow melts
 more frequent tropical storms
 increased incidence of tropical diseases
action taken a united nations conference on climate change held in tokyo japan in  resulted in an international agreement to fight global warming which called for reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by industrialised nations
ozone depletion it refers to the phenomenon of reductions in the amount of ozone layer in the stratosphere
causeseffects it is caused by high levels of chlorine and bromine compounds in the stratosphere
origin of these compounds are chloro flurocarbons cfcs used as cooling substances in air conditioners and refrigerators or as aerosol propellants and bromofluro-carbons
halons used in fire extinguishers
 influences the growth of terrestrial plants
action taken between  to  a reduction of % in ozone layer was detected
since ozone layer prevents most harmful ultraviolet radiation from passing through the earth’s atmosphere so reduction in ozone layer generated worldwide concern leading to adoption of the montreal protocol banning the use of chloroflurocarbon jcfc compounds as well as other ozone depleting chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride tricholoroethane also known as methyl chloroform and bromine compounds known as halons
state of india’s environment india has rich quality of natural resources in plenty of amount
 the black soil of the deccan plateau is particularly suitable for cultivation of cotton
it has lead to concentration of textile industries in this region
 the indo gangetic plains spread from arabian sea to the bay of bengal are one of the most- fertile intensively cultivated and densely populated regions in the world
 india’s forests though unevenly distributed provide green cover for majority of its population and natural cover for its wildlife
 large deposits of iron-ore coal and natural gas are found in the country
india alone accounts for nearly % of the world’s total iron-ore reserves
 bauxite copper chromate diamonds gold lead lignite manganese zinc uranium etc are also available in different parts of the country
threat to india’s environment threat to india’s environment is poverty pollution rapidly growing industrial sector
air pollution water contamination soil erosion deforestation and wildlife extinction are some of the most pressing environmental concerns of india
the developmental activities in india have resulted in pressure on its finite natural resources besides creating impacts on human health and well-being
out of them the priority issues are  land degradation and solid waste management  biodiversity loss  air pollution with special reference to vehicular pollution in urban cities  management of fresh water some of these issues are discussed below land degradation in india land in india suffers from varying degrees and types of degradation stemming mainly from unstable use and inappropriate management practices
the factors responsible for land degradation in india are  loss of vegetation occuring due to deforestation
 unsustainable fuel wood and fodder extraction
 reduction into forest lands
 forest fifes and overgrazing
 non-adoption of adequate soil conservation measures
 indiscriminate use of agro chemicals such as fertilisers and pesticides
 extraction of ground water in excess of the regain capacity
 poverty of the agriculture-dependent people
biodiversity loss india is the owner of 
% of world’s geographical area
india holds % of human and % of livestock population on its land
in order to hold livestock and human in country country needs 
 hectare of land to meet the basic needs but it has only 
 hectare of land which causes felling of forests and soil erosion
 billion tonnes of soil is eroded every year
as a result quantity of nutrients lost due to erosion each year ranges from 
chipko or appiko  what’s in a name chipko movement aimed at protecting forests in the himalayas
in karnataka a similar movement took a different name ‘chpiko’ which means to hug
on th september  when the felling of trees was
started in salkani forest in sirsi district  men women and children huged the trees and forced the woodcutters to leave
they kept vigil in the forest over the next six weeks
only after the forest officials assured the volunteers of the trees will be cut scientifically and in accordance with the working plan of the district did they leave the trees when commercial felling by contractors damaged a large number of natural forests the idea of hugging the trees gave the people hope and confidence that they can protect the forests
on that particular incident with the felling discontinued the people saved  trees
within months this movement spread to many adjoining districts
air pollution in india air pollution is widespread in urban areas where vehicles are the major contributors and in a few other areas which have a high concentration of industries and thermal power plants
pollution from vehicles and industries are the major sources of air pollution
 vehicle pollution vehicle emissions are of particular concern since these are ground level sources and thus have the maximum impact on the general pollution
the number of vehicles has increased from  lakh in  to  crores in 
in  personal transport vehicles two wheeled and cars only contributed about % of the total number of registered vehicles thus contributing significantly to air pollution load
 industrial pollution india is one of the ten most industrialised nations of the world
this status has brought with it unwanted and unanticipated consequences like unplanned urbanisation pollution and the risk of accidents
the cpcb central pollution control board has identified seventeen categories of industries large and medium scale as significantly polluting
management of fresh water water is an equally important element of life and its pollution is equally serious
water becomes polluted when chemicals and other waste materials are dumped into it
polluted water is the principal cause of diseases like diarrhoea and hepatitis
thus the management of fresh water is essential to sustain life
this was followed by states establishing their own state level boards to address all the environmental concerns
different functions of pollution control boards are  to investigate collect and disseminate information relating to water air and land pollution
 to lay down standards for sewagetrade effluent and emissions
 to provide technical assistance to governments in promoting cleanliness of streams and wells by prevention control and abatement of water pollution
 to improve the quality of air and to prevent control or abate air pollution in the country
 to carryout and sponsor investigation and research relating to problems of water and air pollution and for their prevention control and abatement
 to prepare manual codes and guidelines relating to treatment and disposal of sewage and trade effluents
 to assess the air quality through regulation of industries
 state boards through their district officials periodically inspect every industry under their jurisdiction to assess the adequacy of treatment measures provided to treat the effluent and gaseous emissions
 state pollution boards also provide background air quality data needed for industrial siting and town planning
in nutshell it can be said that pollution control boards collect collate and disseminate technical and statistical data relating to water pollution
they monitor the quality of water in  rivers including the tribunaries wells lakes ponds tanks drains and canals
how to save environment the various measures adopted by ministry of environment and the central and state pollution control boards may not yield reward unless we make ourself concious
following are required measures which should be taken to save the environment  social awareness there should be awareness among the people regarding the threats of the increasing pollution and how can each of us contribute to the check this menace
 population control biggest issue which should be controlled is increasing population to protect the environment
 enforcement of environment conservation act the environment act was passed in year 
it was passed to check the detoriated quality of the environment
 afforestation campaign extensive afforestation campaign should be launched to protect environment
 management of solid waste management of solid waste is very essential
it should be treated chemically
rural garbage should be converted into compost
meaning features needs and strategies for sustainable development according to the united nations conference on environment and development unced sustainable development can be defined as “development strategy that meets the need of present generation without compromising the ability of future generation to meet their own needs
” edward barbier a renowned personality had also given the definition of sustainable development sustainable development is one which is directly concerned with increasing the material standards of living of the poor at grass root level
in specific term sustainable development aims at decreasing the absolute poverty of the poor by providing lasting and securing livelihoods that minimise resource depletion environmental degradation cultural disruption and social instability
the brudtland commission emphasises on protecting the future generation
a moral obligation to hand over the planet earth in good order to the future generation i
 the present generation should bequeath a better environment to the future generation
the present generation can promote development that enhances the natural and built environment in the way that are compatible with  conservation of natural as us
 preservation of the regenerative capacity of the worlds natural ecological system
 avoiding the imposition of added costs or risks on future generation
features of sustainable development  sustained rise in real per capital income and economic welfare
 rational use of natural resources
 no reduction in the ability of future generations to meet their own needs
a way to sustainable development according to herman dalay a leading environmental economist the main needs of sustainable development are  limiting the human population to a level within the carrying capacity of the environment
 technological progress should be input efficient and not input consuming
 renewable resources should be extracted on a sustainable basis i
 rate of extraction should not exceed rate of regeneration
 inefficiencies arising from pollution should be corrected
strategies for sustainable development 
use of non-conventional sources of energy india heavily depends on thermal and hydro power plants to meet its power needs
both of these have adverse environmental impacts
thermal power plants emit large quantities of carbon dioxide which is a greenhouse gas
if it is not used properly it may cause land and water pollution
lpg gobar gas in rural areas rural households in india generally use wood dungcake upla or other biomass as fuel
this practice has several adverse implications like deforestation reduction in green cover and air pollution
to rectify the situation subsidised lpg is being provided
besides it gobar gas plants are being encouraged through easy loans and subsidy
lpg is the clean fuel
it does not create any household pollution and also wastage is minimised
cng in urban areas in delhi the use of compressed natural gas cng as fuel in public transport system has significantly lowered air pollution and the air has become cleaner in the last few years
wind power in areas where speed of wind is usually high wind mills can provide electricity without any adverse impact on the environment
the turbines moves with wind and electricity gets generated
its initial cost’ remain high but it can be recovered easily
solar power through photovoltaic cells in india solar energy is used in different forms for agriculture products daily use products and even to warm ourselves in winters
through photovoltaic cells solar energy can be converted into electricity
this technology is extremely useful for remote areas and for places where supply of power lines is either not possible or proves very costly
this technique is also totally free from pollution
bio composting in order to increase production we have started using chemical fertilisers which are adversely affecting the waterbodies ground water system etc
in some parts cattles are maintained only because their waste prouction is very useful in form of fertiliser
mini-hydel plants mountainous regions have streams every where
most of such streams are perennial
mini-hydel plants use the energy of such streams to move small turbines which generate electricity
such power plants are more or less environment friendly
traditional knowledge and practices traditionally indian people have been close to their environment
if we look back at our agriculture system healthcare system housing transport etc we find that all practices have been environment friendly
but in recent years we have been moving away from these practices
this has caused large scale damage to our environment
during older times we used ayurveda unani tibetan and folk systems for the treatments but now we are ignoring the traditional system and we are moving towards the western system
not only these products were environment friendly but they are free from side effects too
biopest control with the advent of green revolution the country entered into the use of chemical pesticides to produce more which laid the adverse impacts on soil water bodies milk meat and fishes
to meet this challenge better methods of pest control should be brought
one step is pesticides based on plants like neem
even many animals also help in controlling pests like snakes peacocks etc
foreign direct investment it is much larger compared to india and pakistan and a much stronger driver of growth
sezs special economic zones policy of china is of central significance inducing fdi
sezs are offering robust infrastructural facilities for fdi
demographic profile both for india and china large size of population is a hindrance in the process of growth as it requires a huge amount of ‘maintenance investment’
human development some important parameters of human development are as these  life expectancy-higher the better
 adult literacy rate-higher the better
 infant mortality rate-lower the better
 maternal mortality rate-lower the better
 percentage of population having access to improved water sources-higher the better
 percentage of undernourished population-lower the better
with a view to accelerating the pace of growth different countries are forming regional and global economic grouping based on common agreements of bilateral relations
 saarc eu asean g-  g-
common success story of india and pakistan  a substantial rise in gdp per capita
 self-sufficiency in food production
 dualistic nature of the economy is gradually declining
 considerable reduction in the incidence of poverty
 poor perfomance in hdi ranking
 political survival of a dominating issue rather than good governance
sex ratio sex ratio is found to be low in all three countries pointing to social backwardness where people hold high preference for a son in the family
nations are also eager to know and understand about the developmental process pursued by their neighbouring nations
it allows them to comprehend their strengths and weaknesses
in the process of globalisation it is essential for every nation to compete with developed countries
this will help in understanding where do we stand today in comparison to others
development strategies of india china and pakistan india china pakistan have many similarities in their development strategies which are as follows  india pakistan and china have started towards their developmental path at the same time
india and pakistan became independent nations in 
while peoples republic of china was established in 
 all the three countries had started planning their development strategies in similar ways
india announced its five year plan in - while ’ pakistan announced its first five year plan in  which is called medium term plan
china announced its first five year plan in 
 india and pakistan adopted similar strategies such as creating a large public sector and raising public expenditure on social development
 till the s all the three countries had similar growth rates and per capita incomes
 economic reforms took place in all the three countries
reforms started in india in  in china in  and in pakistan in 
development strategies of india some of the prominent strategies of india are discussed below 
sound trade system india was a country which had the history of closed trade
because of this historical background there is a critical challenge for india in order to make a new policy which can support the new open trade system
this new reform in economies of india has been introduced and accelerates the economic growth of india
reduction in poverty india has adopted several poverty alleviation programmes to reduce poverty in india
-this would help in increasing per capita income rise in nutrition level of poors and there is a subsequent fall in percentage of absolute poor in some states
rural development under this strategy india adopted various measures for the development of areas that are lagging behind in the overall development of village economy
employment generation several economic reforms were initiated to generate employment in the country and their aim is to provide gainful self-employment and skilled wage employment opportunities
development strategies of china after the establishment of people’s republic of china under one party rule all the critical sectors of the economy enterprises and lands owned and operated by individuals were brought under government control
certain development strategies of china are discussed below  great leap forward glf this campaign initiated in  aimed at industrialising the country on a massive scale
people were encouraged to set up industries in their backyards
in rural areas communes were started
under the commune system people collectively cultivated lands
 great proletarian cultural revolution - in  mao tse tung started a cultural revolution on a large scale
in this revolution students and professionals were sent to work and learn from the country side
unlike glf the cultural revolution did not have an explicit economic rationale
  reforms since  china began to introduce many reforms in phases
the reforms were initiated in agriculture foreign trade and investment sector
in agriculture lands were divided into small plots which were allocated to individual households
they were allowed to keep all income from the land after paying taxes
in later phase reforms were initiated in industrial sector
all enterprises which were owned and operated by local collectives in particular were allowed to produce goods
at this stage enterprises owned by government known as state board enterprises – soes in india we call them public sector enterprises were made to face competition
in reform prices were fixed in two ways i
 farmers and industrial units were required to buy and sell fixed quantities of inputs and outputs on the basis of prices fixed by the government and the rest were purchased and sold at market prices
over the years as production increased the proportion of goods or inputs transacted in the market also increased
the goal of chinese economic reforms was to generate sufficient surplus to finance the modernisation of the mainland chinese economy
in order to attract foreign investors special economic zones sezs were set up
development strategies of pakistan the development strategies of pakistan are summarised below  mixed economy pakistan follows a mixed economy system where both public and private sectors co-existed
 import substitution pakistan adopted a regulatory policy framework in the late s and s for import industrialisation
the -policy combined tariff protection for manufacturing of consumer goods together with direct import controls on competing imports
this increased the output of foodgrains
this had changed the agrarian structure dramatically
in ’s nationalisation of capital goods took place
pakistan shifted its policy orientation in ’s and ’s when private sector got encouragement
during this period pakistan received financial support from western
this helped the country in stimulating economic growth
government also offered incentives to private sector
this had a created climate for new investments
and in  certain reforms were also initiated in the country
success and failure of strategies the development strategies brought structural reforms in china india and pakistan
follow the description of their success and failure one by one
success of structural reforms in china the success of structural reforms in china are  there was existence of infrastructure in the areas of education and health and land reforms
 there was decentralised planning and existence of small enterprise
 through the commune system there was more equitable distribution of foodgrains
 there was extension of basic health services in rural areas
failures of structural reforms in china the failures of structural reforms in china are  there was slow pace of growth and lack of modernisation in the chinese economy under the maoist rule
 maoist vision of economic development based on decentralisation self sufficiency and shunning of foreign technology had failed
 despite of extensive land reforms collectivisation the great leap forward and other initiatives the per capita gain output in  was the same as it was in the mid-s
china has an edge over india the chinese reform process began more comprehensively during the s when india was in the mid-stream of slow growth process
rural poverty in china declined by % during the period  to 
in india it declined only by % during this period global exposure of the economy has been far more wider in china than in india
china’s export-driven manufacturing has recorded on exponential growth while india continues to be only a marginal player in the international markets
common success of structural reforms in india and pakistan the common success of structural reforms in india and pakistan are  both india and pakistan have succeeded in more than doubling their per capita incomes inspite of high growth rate of population
 the incidence of poverty has also been reduced significantly
however the level of poverty is lower in pakistan
 both the countries have succeeded in developing their service and industry sectors at a fast rate
 the use of modern technology is improving in both the countries
common failures of structural reforms in india and pakistan the common failures of structural reforms in india and pakistan are  growth rate of gdp and its sectoral constituents have fallen in ’s
 poverty and unemployment are still areas of major concerns in both the countries
areas where pakistan has an edge over india starting from almost the same level as india pakistan has achieved better results with regards to  migration of workforce from agriculture to industry  migration of people from rural to urban areas
 access to improved water sources
 reduction in below poverty line population
areas where india has an edge over pakistan there is little doubt that in the area of skilled manpower and research and development institutions
india is better placed than pakistan
indian scientists excel in the areas of defence technology space research electronics and avionics genetics telecommunications etc
ds produced by india in science and engineering every year about  is higher than the entire stock of ph
issues of health facilities in general and infant mortality in particular are better addressed in india
comparative study with respect to demographic indicators gdp and hdi
demographic indicators we shall compare some demographic indicators of india china and pakistan  the population of pakistan is very small and accounts for roughly about one-tenth of china or india
though china is the largest nation and geographically occupies the largest area among the three nations its density is the lowest
 one child norm was introduced in china in late ’s to check the problem of population growth
this measure led to decline in the sex ratio
although sex ratio is biased against females in all three countries in recent times all three countries are trying to adopt various measures to improve the situation
after few decades there will be more elderly people in proportion to young people due to one child norm
 the fertility rate is low in china and very high in pakistan
 urbanisation is high in both pakistan and china
gross domestic product and sectors according to the latest data available we find i china has the second largest gdp ppp of us$ 
 trillion whereas india’s gdp ppp is us $ 
 trillion and pakistan’s gdp ppp is 
 trillion us$ roughly about % of india’s gdp
ii in ’s pakistan was ahead of india china was having double digit growth and india was at the bottom
source key indicators for asia and pacific  asian development bank phillipines iii in - there is a marginal decline in india and chinas growth rates whereas pakistan met with drastic decline in 
the reform processes introduced in  in pakistan and political instability are reasons behind this trend
iv china and pakistan have more proportion of urban people than india
v in china due to topographic and climatic conditions the area suitable for cultivation is relatively small-only about % of its total land area
the total cultivable area in china accounts for % of the cultivable area in india
vi until the s more than % of the people in china were dependent on farming as their sole source of livelihood
vii the government encouraged people to leave their fields and pursue other activities such as handicrafts commerce and transport
viii in  with % of its workforce engaged in agriculture its contribution to gdp in china is %
ix in both india and pakistan the contribution of agriculture to gdp was at  and % respectively
but the proportion of workforce that works in this sector is more in india
in pakistan about % of people work in agriculture whereas in india it is %
xi in china manufacturing contributes the highest to gdp at % whereas in india and pakistan it is the service sector which contributes the highest
in both these countries service sector accounts for more than % of gdp
in the normal course of development countries first shift their employment and output from agriculture to manufacturing and then to services
this is what is happening in china
the proportion of workforce engaged in manufacturing in india and pakistan were low at  and % respectively
xii the contribution of industries to gdp is also just equal to or marginally higher than the output from agriculture
in india and pakistan the shift is taking place directly to the service sector
xiii thus in both india and pakistan the service sector is emerging as a major player of development
it contributes more to gdp and at the same time emerges as a prospective employer
xiv in the s india china and pakistan employed   and % of its workforce in the service sector respectively
in - it has reached the level of   and % respectively
human development indicator india china and pakistan have performed in some of the selected indicators of human development
 pakistan is ahead of india in reducing proportion of people below the poverty line and also its performance in education sanitation and access to water is better than that of india
 in china for one lakh births only  women die whereas in india  women die and in pakistan  women die
human development index hpi hdi includes quantitative aspects of per capital gdp and the quality aspects of performance in
it is an average of life expectancy index education index and gdp index
about  families live here
it is  km away from raiganj — a big village
 shahpur is the nearest town to the village
main production activities  farming is the main production activity in the village palampur
 most of the people are dependent on farming for their livelihood
 non-farming activities such as dairy small-scale manufacturing e
 activities of weavers and potters etc
 are carried out on a limited scale
factors of production or requirements for production of goods and services  land labour and capital are the basic requirements for the production of goods and services which are popularly known as factors of production
 land includes all free gifts of nature e
 soil water forests minerals etc
 labour means human effort which of course includes physical as well as mental labour
 physical capital is the third requirement for production
 physical capital includes fixed capital e
 and raw materials such as seeds for the farmer yarn for the weaver
important changes in farm activities land area under cultivation is virtually fixed
however some wastelands in india had been converted into cultivable land after 
over the years there have been important changes in the way of farming which have allowed the farmers to produce more crops from the same amount of land
due to these changes in the late s productivity of land has increased substantially which is known as green revolution
farmers of punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh were the first to try out the modern farming methods in india
labour after land labour is the basic factor of production
small farmers provide their own labour whereas medium and large farmers make use of hired labour to work on their fields
capital after land and labour capital is another basic factor of production
all categories of farmers e
 small medium and large require capital
small farmers borrow from big farmers or the village moneylenders or the traders who supply them various inputs for cultivation
modern farming requires a great deal of capital
sale of surplus farm products farmers produce crops on their lands by using the three factors of production viz
they retain a part of produce for self-consumption and sell the surplus in the nearby market
that part of farm produce which is sold in the market is called marketable surplus
small farmers have little surplus output
it is the medium and big farmers only who have substantial surplus produce for selling in the market
non-farming activities out of every  workers in the rural areas in india only  are engaged in non-farming activities
there is a variety of non-farming activities in the villages
dairy small scale manufacturing transport etc
 fall under this category
 various aspects of human resource development  the role of education  unemployment and forms of unemployment in india
human beings perform many activities which can be grouped into economic and non- economic
economic activities economic activities refer to those activities of human which are undertaken for a monetary gain or to satisfy hisher wants
the activities of workers farmers shopkeepers manufacturers doctors lawyers taxi drivers etc
non-economic activities non-economic activities are ones that are not undertaken for any monetary gain
these are also called unpaid activities e
 puja-paath housekeeping helping the poor or disabled etc
classification of economic activities various economic activities can be classified into three main sectors that is primary sector secondary sector and tertiary sector
the primary sector includes activities like agriculture forestry animal husbandry fishing poultry farming and mining
in this sector goods are produced by exploiting nature
in the secondary sector manufacturing small and large and construction activities are included
the tertiary sector also called service sector provides various types of services like transport education banking insurance health tourism etc
market activities and non-market activities economic activities i
 production of goods and services can be classified into market activities and non-market activities
market activities are’performed for remuneration
non-market activities are the activities carried out for self¬consumption
activities of women women generally look after domestic affairs like cooking of food washing of clothes cleaning of utensils housekeeping and looking after children
human capital human capital is the stock of skill and productive knowledge embodied in human beings
population human beings become human capital when it is provided with better education training and health care facilities
human capital formation when the existing human resource is further developed by spending on making the workforce more educated and healthy it is called human capital formation
quality of population the quality of population depends upon the literacy rate life expectancy and skills formation acquired by the people of the country
role of education education is the most important component of human resource development
in view of its contribution towards the growth of the society government expenditure on education as a percentage of gdp rose from 
% in - to 
however our national goal is % of gdp health health is another very important component of human resource development
the efficiency of workers largely depends on their health
there has been a considerable improvement in the country’s health standard
for instance the life expectancy at the time of birth in india rose from 
 years in  to 
similarly the infant mortality rate has come down from  to  during the same time period
unemployment unemployment is said to exist when people who are willing to work at the prevailing wage rates cannot find jobs
when we talk of unemployed people we refer to those in the age group of - years
children below  years of age and the old people above  are not considered while counting the number of unemployed
nature of unemployment in india seasonal unemployment occurs when people fail to get work during some months of the year that is during off-season
farm labourers usually face this kind of problem i disguised unemployment is another kind of unemployment found in rural areas
such kind of problem arises due to excessive pressure of population on agriculture
disguised unemployment refers to a situation wherein the number of workers in a job is more than actually required to do the job
the extra number of workers are disguisedly unemployed
consequences of unemployment  unemployment leads to wastage of manpower resource
 unemployment tends to increase the economic overload that is the dependence of the unemployed on the working population
 unemployment may lead to an increase in social unrest and tension
poverty is a condition in which a person lacks the financial resources and essentials things to enjoy minimum standards of life
poor people can be landless labourers in villages jhuggi and slum dwellers in cities and towns daily wage workers at construction sites child  workers in dhabas or even beggars
india has the largest single concentration of the poor in the world where every fourth person is poor
two typical cases of poverty the following two cases show the many dimensions of poverty including lack of proper food shelter healthcare education as well as clean water and sanitation
they also show lack of a regular means of livelihood
i urban case ram saran is a daily wage labourer in a flour mill near ranchi in jharkhand
 per month when employed
he supports his family of  persons besides sending some money to his elderly parents
his wife and son also work but none of his  children can attend school
the family lives in a one-room rented house on the outer areas of the city the children are undernourished have very few clothes or footwear and no access to healthcare
ii rural case lakha singh is a landless labourer in a small village near meerut in uttar pradesh
by doing odd jobs for farmers he earns rs
sometimes he gets some foodgrain or other items instead of cash
he is not literate and his family of  people lives in a kuchha hut near the edge of the village
they have no access to healthcare cannot afford new clothes or even soap or oil
poverty analysis by social scientists social scientists analyze poverty from many aspects besides levels of income and consumption
these aspects are  poor level of literacy  malnutrition leading to poor resistance to disease  lack of access to healthcare  lack of job opportunities  lack of access to sanitation and safe drinking water and so on
social exclusion a social exclusion means living in a poor surrounding with poor people excluded from enjoying social equality of better off people in the better surrounding
social exclusion can be a cause as well as a result of poverty which leads to exclusion of individuals or groups from facilities benefits and opportunities that others enjoy
in india the caste system is based on social exclusion
people belonging to certain caste were prevented from enjoying equal facilities benefits and opportunities
this caused more poverty than the lower income
vulnerability vulnerability to poverty is a measure which describes the greater probability of certain communities e
members of a backward caste or individuals e
widow physically handicapped person of becoming or remaining poor in the coming time
vulnerability is determined by various options available to different communities in terms of assets education job health etc and analyse their ability to face various risks like natural disasters
the group which face greater risk at the time of natural calamity are called vulnerable groups
poverty line poverty line is an imaginary line used by any country to determine its poverty
it is considered appropriate by a country according to its existing social norms
it varies from time to time place to place and country to country
the most common method of determining poverty is income or consumption levels i
people will be considered poor if their income or consumption level falls below a given ‘minimum level’ poverty line necessary to fulfil the basic needs
poverty line estimation in india in india a subsistence level or minimum level of food requirement as determined by its calorific value clothing footwear fuel lighting-educational and medical requirements etc are determined for estimating the poverty line
since ih rural and urban areas the nature of work and the prices of goods are different the calorific requirement and expenditure per capita are also different
in urban areas the prices of essential items is higher when compared to the rural areas and so the poverty line is higher despite having low calorific requirement per day
it conducts surveys at the interval of  years
it was established in 
as per this method the poverty line is level of minimum availability of the equivalent of $ per person per day
poverty trends in india there is a decline in poverty ratios in india from about % in  to 
if the trend of declining poverty ratios in india continues at this rate then the poverty line may reduce % in the next few years
group vulnerable to poverty poverty among social groups and economic categories varies widely in india
social vulnerable groups are the households of the scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts
economically vulnerable groups comprise rural landless labour households and urban casual labour households
however during the last few years all these groups except the scheduled tribes group have witnessed a decline in poverty
ministry of statistics and programme implementation government of india
there is a great difference within poor families
it is observed that female infants women and elderly members are not given equal access to resources available to the family
so they are also called poorest of the poor
story of sivaraman the family of sivaraman a rural landless labourer has been cited as an example of such a family
there are  members in the family and both he and the wife work
his children do not attend school due to poverty
only his son gets milk sometimes and they find difficulty in managing even two meals in a day
the story portays the sufferings of sivaraman who works as an agricultural labourer that too for just - months in a year
the sufferings and inequality within the family for women and children »are even more
girls are not sent to school and not even given milk to drink while the youngest child who is a son gets milk to drink sometimes and his parents also plan for his education
inter-state disparities the proportion of poor people is not the same in every state
recent estimates show while the all india hcr was 
% in - states like madhya pradesh assam uttar pradesh bihar and orissa had all india poverty level
bihar and odisha continue to be the two poorest states with poverty ratios of 
alongwith rural poverty urban poverty is also high in odisha madhya pradesh bihar and uttar pradesh
in states like kerala jammu and kashmir andhra pradesh tamil nadu gujarat west bengal there is a significant decline in poverty
the states successful in reducing poverty have adopted different methods for doing so
some examples are  punjab and haryana had high agricultural growth rates due to the effects of the green revolution
 kerala has developed its human resources by investing more in education
 west bengal has reduced poverty by implementing land reforms
 public distribution of foodgrains at subsidised prices in andhra pradesh and tamil nadu has helped in poverty reduction
 jammu and kashmir have generated wide-ranging economic activities all across the state and converted potential in various sectors into employment opportunities
global poverty scenario although extreme economic poverty has reduced in the world from % in  to % in  as per the world bank still there are vast regional differences
in south-east asia and china there is a decline in poverty due to rapid economic growth and massive investment in human resource development
in latin america and the caribbean the poverty ratio has not changed significantly since 
in sub-saharan africa poverty has increased since  due to successive droughts and other reasons
however it declined from % in  to % in 
economic growth it is a term which defines an increase in real output of a country
the millennium development goals of the united nations formulated in the year  call for reducing the proportion of people living on less than $ a day to half the  level by 
causes of poverty poverty continues in india for a variety of reasons
these are  historically there was a low level of economic development under the british colonial administration prior to 
they discouraged traditional handicrafts and also industrial development reducing job opportunities and income growth
 the low level of economic development persisted for many years after independence and due to population increase per capita income growth was low increasing poverty
 the green revolution improved opportunities in agriculture only in certain areas of the country
traditions and economic factors lead to extra expenditure which ultimately increases poverty
 there is an unequal distribution of land and other resources that is why there are large income inequalities also
 land reforms have not been properly implemented and lack of adequate land resources is also a reason for many people to be poor
 small farmers borrow money for seeds fertilisers and pesticides etc and later on fail to pay landing in debt trap
this high level of indebtedness is both the cause and effect of poverty
anti-poverty measures removal of poverty has been one of the major objectives of indian developmental strategy
the current anti-poverty strategy of the government is based on the following two objectives i promotion of economic growth the government has promoted economic growth during the last few years
economic growth was low till the s but has increased significantly since then causing significant poverty reduction
the high economic growth helps in a significant reduction of poverty
there is strong linkage between economic growth and poverty reduction
economic growth widens opportunities and provides the resources needed to invest in human development
high economic growth encourages people to send their children including the girl child to school with hope of better economic returns from investing in education
the poof may not take direct advantage of economic growth
due to lack of growth in the agricultural sector the large number of people remain poor in rural areas
ii targeted anti-poverty programmes the government introduced targeted anti-poverty programmes starting from 
the results of these programmes have been mixed due to lack of proper implementation and improper targeting
also some schemes overlap others
thus the benefits of these schemes are not fully reaching the deserving poor
so now the government is emphasising more on proper monitoring of all these programmes
millennium development goals these are eight international development goals that were officially established following the millennium summit of the united nations in  following the adoption of the united nations millennium declaration
one of these was to reduce by % the proportion of people living on less than us $ a day by the year 
further poverty should include not only the matter of the adequate amount of food but other factors like education healthcare shelter job security gender equality dignity and so on
these give us the concept of human poverty
poverty reduction is expected to be lower in the next - years
in addition to anti-poverty measures the government should focus on the following to reduce poverty
 universal free elementary education
 the decrease in population growth
 empowerment of women and weaker sections
summary the most difficult challenge faced by independent india is poverty
social scientists analysis poverty from many aspect besides level of income and consumption
these aspects include poor level of literacy lack of job opportunities etc
social exclusion aneb* vulnerability are the most commonly used indicators for poverty analysis
the poverty line is an imaginary line used by any country to determine is poverty
it varies time to time place to place and country to country
the most common method of determining poverty is income or consumption levels
the calorific requirement and expenditure per capita are different for urban and rural areas
poverty among social groups and economic categories varies widely in india
female infants women and elderly member are not given equal access to resources available to the family
bihar and odisha continue to be the two poorest states with poverty ratios of 
in states like kerala andhra pradesh gujarat there is significant decline in poverty
the proportion of people living under poverty in different countries is defined by the international poverty line i
population below $  a day
there is decline in poverty in south-east asia and china due to rapid economic growth and massive investment in human resource development
there are many causes for the prevalence of poverty in india like unemployment low economic development and income inequalities
removal of poverty has been one of the major objectives of indian developmental strategy
there is a strong linkage between economic growth and poverty reduction
the government of india introduced targeted anti-poverty programmes starting from 
poverty reduction is still a major challenge in india due to the wide differences between regions as well as rural and urban areas
food security depends on the public distribution system pds and government vigilance and time to time action when this security is threatened
meaning of food security food security means availability of adequate supply of basic foodstuffs at all times
the  world food summit declared “food security at the individual household regional national and global levels exists when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”
the declaration further recognises that “poverty eradication is essential to improve access to food”
food security has the following dimensions  availability of food it means food production within the country food imports and the previous years stock stored in government granaries
 accessibility of food it means food is within reach of every person
 affordability of food it implies that an individual has enough money to buy sufficient safe and nutritious food to meet one’s dietary needs
the above dimensions conclude that food security is ensured in a country only if * enough food is available for all the persons
 all persons have the capacity to buy food of acceptable quality
 there is no barrier on access to food
necessity of food security food security is needed in a country to ensure food at all times
it is needed to ensure that no person in a country dies of hunger
effect of natural calamity on food security most of the time the poorest section of society might be food insecure
but persons above the poverty line might also be food insecure when the country faces a national disastercalamity like earthquake drought flood tsunami widespread failure of crops causing famine etc
- the total production of foodgrains decreases due to a natural calamity
it creates a shortage of food in the affected areas
the price of the food products goes up due to this shortage
at high prices some people cannot afford to buy food
massive starvation might take a turn of famine
thus natural calamity affects food security adversely
famine and starvation a famine is characterised by widespread deaths due to starvation and epidemics caused by forced use of impure water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation
the most devastating famine in india was the famine of bengal in 
thirty lakh people died in it
the price of rice the staple diet of the people in the region increased sharply
people affected by famine no famine has occurred in india since independence
but today also there are places like kalahandi and kashipur in odisha where famine-like condition still prevails
starvation deaths are also reported in baran district of rajasthan palamau in jharkhand and man^ other remote areas
food insecure people food and nutrition insecurity has affected the large section in india
but the most affected people in the rural areas are landless agricultural labourers traditional artisans and petty self-employed workers
in urban areas the most affected are beggars and homeles people casual labourers people employed in ill-paid occupations and construction migrant and other seasonal workers
further many pregnant and nursing mothers and also children under the age of  years are food insecure people
the second national health and family survey nhfs conducted during -
estimated that approximately  crore women and children in india are food insecure
food insecure regions economically backward states with high level of poverty tribal and remote areas regions more prone to natural disasters like eastern and south-eastern parts of uttar pradesh bihar odisha jharkhand west bengal chhattisgarh maharashtra and parts of madhya pradesh consist the largest number of food insecure people
hunger food insecurity also has an important aspect of hunger
to create food security current hunger should be removed and the risk of future hunger should be reduced
hunger has two dimensions i
national health and family survey nhfs - a large-scale multi-round survey conducted in a representative sample of households throughout india
three rounds of the survey have been conducted since the first survey in - and this was the second
there are two types of hunger
these are as follows i chronic hunger it is a consequence of a diet regularly deficient in quantity and quality this is caused due to lack of income to buy food for survival
chronic hunger has reduced in rural areas from 
% of households in  to 
% in  – 
in urban areas it has reduced from 
% during the same period
ii seasonal hunger it is related to seasonal cycles of food growing and harvesting
it affects landless* agricultural labourers in rural areas the most
in urban areas casual construction workers suffer from this during the time when they do not get work
the proportion of households experiencing seasonal hunger in rural areas has reduced significantly from 
% in  to 
in urban areas it has reduced from 
% during the reference period
note malnutrition is a condition that results from eating a diet in which certain nutrients are lacking or in wrong proportions
measures for self-sufficiency in foodgrains
india is aiming at self-sufficiency in foodgrains since independence
india has adopted all measures to achieve self-sufficiency in foodgrains
the’ green revolution during the late s and early s helped significantly to achieve this although the success varied from region to region
during this period high yielding varieties hyvs of wheat and rice were introduced in many states
the highest rate of growth was achieved in punjab and uttar pradesh where foodgrain production jumped from 
 million tonnes in - to reach an all-time high of 
 million tonnes in -
production of foodgrains in uttarakhand jharkhand assam tamil nadu has dropped
west bengal and uttar pradesh on the other hand recorded significant increases in rice yield in -
indira gandhi the then prime minister of india officially recorded the impressive progress of the green revolution in agriculture by releasing a special stamp entitled ‘wheat revolution’ in julyl
food corporation of india fci this was set-up under the food corporation’s act  in order to support operations for safeguarding the farmers distribution of foodgrains throughout the country tor pds and maintaining satisfactory level of operational and buffer stocks
presently there are  crops being purchased with such prices including varieties of cereals pulses oilseeds fibre crops and others
food security in india the green revolution was started in early s
since then our country has avoided famine even during adverse weather conditions
india has become self-sufficient in foodgrains during the last  years due to the variety of crops grown
foodgrains availability even in adverse conditions has been ensured by the government through a food security system consisting of maintaining a buffer stock of foodgrains alongwith a public distribution system pds for foodgrains and other essential items
buffer stock it is the stock of foodgrains wheat and rice procured by the government
government purchases wheat and rice from farmers through the food corporation of india fci states having surplus production
the farmers are paid a minimum support price msp for their crops
the msp is announced at the beginning of the sowing season to give an incentive to the farmers to grow more
these purchased foodgrains are stored in granaries as a buffer stock
this stock is maintained to distribute foodgrains through the pds in the areas of the country where production is less
it is provided to the poorer sections of society at subsidised prices i
lower than the market price which is known as the issue price
the buffer stock also helps to resolve the problem of food shortage due to a calamity or in adverse weather conditions
due to this three important food intervention programmes were introduced
they are  public distribution system pds for foodgrains  integrated child development services icds  food-for work ffw programme
public distribution system pds through government regulated ration shops the food procured by the fci is distributed among the poorer sections of the society
this is called the public distribution system pds
ration shops are now present in most localities villages towns and cities
 lakh ration shops all over the country
ration shops are also known as fair price shops
they keep stock of foodgrains sugar kerosene oil for cooking
these items are sold to people at a price lower than the market price
any family with a ration card can buy
a stipulated amount of these items e
 kg of grains  litres of kerosene  kg of sugar etc every month from the nearby ration shop
 bpl card for families below the poverty line
 apl card for all others
rationing it is a term given to government controlled distribution of resources and scarce goods or services
it restricts how much people are allowed to buy or consume at a particular time within a particular period
rationing in india was introduced in s against the backdrop of the bengal famine
later it was revived in the wake of an acute food shortage during s prior to the green revolution
current status of public distribution system in the beginning the pds coverage was universal with no discrimination between the poor and non-poor
in  a revamped public distribution system rpds was started in  blocks of the country to provide the benefits of pds in remote and backward areas
in  a targeted public distribution system tpds was introduced to target the ‘poor in all areas’ with a lower issue price for foodgrains for them compared to the price paid by non-poor people
further in year  two special schemes antyodaya anna yojana aay and annapura scheme aps were launched
i antyodaya anna yojana aay for the ‘poorest of poor’
aay was launched in december 
under the scheme  crore of the poorest among the bpl families covered under the targeted public distribution system tpds were identified
poor families were identified by the respective state rural development departments through a below poverty line bpl survey
 kg of foodgrains were made available to each eligible family at a highly subsidised+ rate of rs
 per kg for wheat and   per kg for rice
this quantity was increased from  kg to  kg from april 
ii annapurna scheme aps for the ‘indigent senior citizen’
it provides  kg of foodgrains free of cost per month to senior citizens who are not receiving any pension or have any other source of income or having a family to support them i
following are some remarkable achievements of pds  pds has helped government to stabilise foodgrain prices so that it is available to consumers at affordable rates
 it has helped in avoiding widespread hunger and famine by supplying food from surplus regions to deficit ones
 it also helped in increasing foodgrain production besides providing income security to farmers in some areas
 in some fci godowns grains are getting damaged or eaten by rats and still instances of hunger are prevalent
 high level of buffer stock of 
 million tonnes of wheat and rice in  was much more than the minimum level of buffer norms
the excess stock of foodgrains bought from farmers at high  prices leads to high carrying costs for the government besides leading to deterioration and wastage
 the pressure exerted by leading foodgrain producing states to increase the buying cost has increased msp
the rising’ msp has increased the maintenance cost of procured foodgrains storage cost and transportation cost
 the buying of foodgrains is concentrated in a few prosperous states like punjab haryana western uttar pradesh andhra pradesh and to a lesser extent in west bengal
 the high msps have made farmers to cultivate wheat and rice more resulting in depletion of the water table as they require more water to grow
this has also led to soil degradation endangering future sustainability of agricultural development in the regions where these are grown
malpractices in pds pds has also become ineffective in many regions of the country because dealers running the ration shops are indulged in malpractices the malpractices indulged into by the dealers include  diverting the grains to open market to get a better margin
 selling poor quality grains at ration shops
 irregular opening of the shops and so on
the malpractices have resulted in consumers of bihar uttar pradesh madhya pradesh and odisha buying much less foodgrains than the national average from the ration shops
in the southern states where the shops are run by cooperatives the consumers purchase much more than the national average
since the introduction of targeted distribution system tpds with three levels of prices for three different income level families the above poverty line apl families do not have much incentive to buy foodgrains from the ration shops
the prices for these families are not significantly lower than market prices
subsidy it is a payment that a government makes to a producer to supplement the market price of a commodity
subsidy helps in keeping consumer prices low while maintaining a higher income for domestic producers
integrated child development services icds in  it was introduced on an experimental basis
food-for-work ffw programme the main objective of the food for work programme is generation of supplementary wage employment
it is open to all rural people who are in need of unskilled work wage employment
national food for work programme national food for work programme was launched on th november  in  most backward districts of the country with the objective of intensifying the generation of supplementary wage employment
the programme is open to all rural poor who are in need of wage employment and desire to do manual unskilled work
it is implemented as a % centrally sponsored scheme and the foodgrains are provided to the states free of cost
the collector is the nodal officer at the district level and has the overall responsibility of planning implementation coordination monitoring and supervision
the programme from  has since been subsumed in nrega
poverty alleviation programmes paps over the last few years several other poverty alleviation programmes paps were launched mostly in rural areas
some of – them have also been restructured
some of these programmes have explicit food components
others are employment programmes which improve food security by increasing the income of the poor
for example rural wage employment programme employment guarantee scheme sampurna grameen rozgar yojana and mid-day-meal
role of cooperatives in food security the role played by cooperatives in food security of india is important especially in the southern and western parts of the country
the cooperative societies set-up shops to sell low priced goods to poor people
for example out of all fair price shops running in tamil nadu around % are being run by the cooperatives
the examples shown below are success stories of cooperatives in order to contribute in food security of india in delhi mother dairy is making progress in the provision of milk and vegetables to the consumers at a controlled rate decided by the government of delhi
amul is another success story of cooperatives in milk and milk products from gujarat
it has brought about the white revolution in the country
in maharashtra academy of development science ads has facilitated a network of ngos for setting up grain banks in different regions
the ads grain bank programme is acknowledged as a successful and innovative food security intervention
summary the availability accessibility and affordability of food to all people at all times is called food security
when there is problems in food production or distribution poor household has to suffer the most
the food security in india depends on the public distribution system pds and vigilant and timely action of the government
food is an essential item for the survival of human being
food security of a nation is ensured if all of its citizens have enough nutritious food available availability all person having the capacity to buy food affortat>ijit^ and there is no barrier on access to food accessibility
the poorest strata of society are mostly food insecure and the better off might face food insecurity during national disaster and calamity
during natural calamity there is decrease in foodgrain production which causes shortage of foodgrain
the increased price ultimately leads to starvation and famine
epidemics during famine is caused by forced use of contaminated water or decaying food and loss of body resistance due to weakening from starvation
landless people traditional artisans petty self employed workers and destitutes including beggars are worst affected groups from food and nutrition insecurity
workers of ill-paid occupations and casual labourer are the most food insecure people in urban areas
agriculture is seasonal and low paying activity
besides the inability to buy food the social composition like scs stc obcs etc also has role in food insecurity
economically backward states with high incidence of poverty tribal and rural areas regions prone to natural disaster has largest number of food insecure people
poverty and hunger are two dimensions of food insecurity
hunger can be chronic or seasonal
the chronic hunger is the consequence of a diet regularly deficient in quantity and quality due to lack of income
the seasonal hunger is the consequence of seasonal nature of food production and harvesting which affects landless agricultural labourers the most
through green revolution india attained self sufficiency in foodgrain production
the food security system of government consist of component of buffer stock and public distribution system
buffer stock is the stock of foodgrains wheat and rice procured by government through fci from surplus producing state for distribution through pds to deficit states and the poorest section of society
the pre-announced price paid by government to farmers is called minimum support price msp
the price at which foodgrains is distributed to poorer section of people is called issue price
it is lower than market price
the system of distribution of food procured by the fci among the poorer section of society is called the public distribution system pds
ration shops also known as fair price shops keep stocks of foodgrains sugar kerosene etc to be sold to people at a price lower than market price
in addition to pds the other poverty alleviation programme comprising component of food security are  integrated child development service icds food for work ffw mid day meals antyodaya anna yojana aay etc
various cooperatives ngos are also working intensively along with government to ensure food security of india
keynes john maynard keynes during the period of - towards the rectification of great depression in america emphasizing mainly on aggregate demand aggregate supply propensity to consume and save and its types including related numericals
aggregate demand aggregate supply and three components 
aggregate demand a aggregate demand refers to the total demand for final goods and services in an economy during an accounting year
b aggregate demand is aggregate expenditure on ex-ante planned consumption and ex-ante planned investment that all sectors of the economy are willing to incur at each income level
note in terms of keynes aggregate demand refers to the total amount of money which the buyers are ready to spend on purchase of goods and services produced in an economy during a given period
it should be kept in mind that keynes measured aggregate demand not in terms of physical goods and services but as a part of total income that society is ready to spend
c components of aggregate demand the components of aggregate demand are i private or household consumption demand • the total expenditure incurred by all the households of the country on their personal consumption is known as private consumption expenditure
• consumption demand depends mainly on disposable income and propensity to consume
ii private investment demand • private investment demand refers to the demand for capital goods by private investors
• it is addition to the existing stock of real capital assets such as machines tools factory – building etc
• investments demand depends upon marginal efficiency of capital marginal efficiency of investment and interest rate
• investment is of two types autonomous investment and induced investment but in keynes theory investment is assumed to be autonomous
• in a modern economy the government is an important buyer of goods and services
it is income inelastic i
 it is not affected by change in income level
the volume of autonomous investment is the same at all levels of income
its curve is a straight line parallel to horizontal axis
• the government demand may be on account of public needs for roads schools hospitals power irrigation etc for the maintenance of law and order and for defence
iv demand for net export x – m • net export represents foreign demand for goods and services produced by an economy
• when exports exceed imports net exports is positive and when imports exceed net exports is negative
• exports and imports of a country are influenced by a number of factors such as foreign trade policy exchange- rate prices and quality of goods etc
thus aggregate demand consists of these four types of demand
however for the sake of simplicity keynes included only two types of demand -> consumption demand c -> investment demand i aggregate demand can be explained with the help of ad schedule and ad curve
aggregate supply a the concept of aggregate supply δs is related with the total supply of goods and services by all the producers in an economy
four factor of production like land labour capital and enterprise are required for the production of goods and services
producers pay rent to land wages and salaries to labour interest to capital and profits to the entrepreneur for their services in production
this payment is factor- cost from producer’s point of view and factor-income from factor-owner angle
b thus aggregate supply is the total amount of money value of goods and services which is paid to the factor of production against their factor services that all the producers are willing to supply in an economy
in other words it is the total cost of production of goods and services produced in a country or it is the value of net national product at factor cost nnpfc
thus the main components of aggregate supply are c keynes assumed his economy to be a closed capitalist economy and whenever any economy is closed capitalist then net factor income from abroad nfia is 
consumption function expresses functional relationship between aggregate consumption and national income
thus consumption c is a function of income y
c = f y where c = consumption f = function y = disposable income consumption at a point of time can be measured with the equation 
according to keynes as income increases consumption expenditure also increases but increase in consumption is smaller than the increase in income
in other words consumption lags behind income
this is called keynes’ psychological law of consumption
according to keynes propensity to consume of the people remains stable in the short period
break-even point refers to that point in the level of income at which consumption is just equal to income
in other words whole of income is spent on consumption and there is no saving
below this level of income consumption is greater than income but above this level income is greater than consumption
in the given imaginary household schedule of consumption and saving at annual income level of rs
 and in consequence there is no saving
it is evident from the table and diagram that i as the income increases consumption also increases but the increase in consumption remains less than the increase in income
ii income can be zero but consumption can never be zero in the economy
iii when c > y saving are negative
iv when c = y savings are zero
this is known as break-even point
this is shown by point e in the diagram
thus break-even point indicates a point where consumption becomes equal to income or consumption curve cuts the income curve
it indicates the percentage or ratio of income which is being spent on consumption
it is worked out by dividing total consumption expenditure c by total income y
a consumption c ii it can be explained with the help of following schedule and diagram iii important points for apc • when apc is more than  when apc is more than  consumption is more than national income i
• apc =  when apc is equal to  consumption is equal to national income which is known as to be break-even point
• when apc is less than  when consumption is less than national income i
beyond the break- even point
b marginal propensity to consume mpc i the ratio of change in consumption c to change in income y is known as marginal propensity to consume
it indicates the proportion of additional income that is being spent on consumption
• mpc falls with the successive increase in income it happens because as an economy becomes richer it has the tendency to consume smaller percentage of each increment to its income
a propensity to save or saving function shows the functional relationship between aggregate savings and income
saving can be both negative and positive
prior to break-even point saving is negative at break-even point saving is zero and after the break-even point saving is positive
c important points for saving function i starting point of saving curve • saving curve ss starts from point _c on the y-axis indicating that there is negative saving equal to amount of autonomous consumption when national income is zero
note the saving curve will have a negative intercept on y-axis of the same magnitude as the consumption curve has positive intercept on the y-axis
it happens because if consumption is positive at zero level of income then there would be dis-savings of the same magnitude
• break-even point s = 
saving curve crosses the x-axis at point r which is known as break-even point as at this point saving is zero or consumption is equal to income
• positive saving after the break-even point saving is positive
types of propensity to save a average propensity to save aps i the ratio of aggregate saving to aggregate income is known as average propensity to save aps
by dividing aggregate saving by aggregate income we get aps
as saving can never be equal to or more than national income
• aps can be  aps is  when income is equal to consumption i
this point is known as break-even point
• aps can be negative or less than 
at income levels which are lower than the break-even point aps can be negative as there will be dis- savings in the economy
• aps rises with increase in income
• aps rises with the increase in income because the proportion of income saved keeps on increasing
b marginal propensity to save i the ratio of change in saving δs to change in income δy is called mps
it is proportion of income saved out of additional incremental income
aggregate demand it is aggregate expenditure on ex-ante planned consumption and ex-ante plannedinvestment that all sectors of the economy are willing to incur at each income level
induced investment it refers to the investment which is made with the motive of earning profit
autonomous investment it refers to the investment which is made irrespective of level of income
aggregate supply aggregate supply is the total amount of money value of goods and services which is paid to the factor of production against their factor services that all the producers are willing to supply in an economy
consumption function consumption functionpropensity to consume expresses functional relationship between aggregate consumption and national income
thus consumption c is a function of income y
c = f y and c = c + b y 
autonomous consumption it refers to minimum level of consumption i
c which is needed for survival i
 consumption at zero level of national income
keynes’ psychological law of consumption according to keynes as income increases consumption expenditure also increases but increase in consumption is smaller than the increase in income
in other words consumption lags behind income
break even point break-even point refers to that point in the level of income at which consumption is just equal to income
in other words whole of income is spent on consumption and there is no saving
average propensity to consume the ratio of aggregate consumption expenditure to aggregate income is known as average propensity to consume
marginal propensity to consume the ratio of change in consumption c to change in income y is known as marginal propensity to consume
it indicates the proportion of additional income that is being spent on consumption
saving function saving function propensity to save shows the functional relationship between aggregate savings and income
s = f y and s = — c +  — b y 
average propensity to save the ratio of aggregate saving to aggregate income is known as average propensity to save aps
marginal propensity to save the ratio of change in saving δs to change in income δy is called mps
it is proportion of income saved out of additional incremental income
concept of multiplier based numerical on it and its working is also highlighted
determination of equilibrium level of national income or keynesian theory of income and employment a it refers to that point which has come to be established under the given condition of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and has tendency to stick to that level under this given condition condition to get equilibrium level of ny • ad = as • investment = saving how is investment = saving here ad = as c + i = c + s i = c + s – c i = s b if due to some disturbance we divert from that position then the economic forces will work in such a manner so as to drive us back to the original position i
 aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply
c any movement from that point would be unstable
in short it is a position of rest
d it can be explained with the help of following schedule and diagram e figure b is derived from figure a
in figure a at point p income is equal to consumption which is known as to be breakeven point
corresponding to point p we derive point p in figure b where saving is equal to zero
in figure a the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e where aggregate supply = aggregate demand
corresponding to point e we derive the point e where saving = investment
determination of equilibrium level of national income through aggregate demand-aggregate supply approach a it refers to the point that has come to be established under the given condition of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and has tendency to stick to that level under this given condition where aggregate demand = aggregate supply
b if due to some disturbance we divert from that position the economic forces will work in such a manner so as to drive us back to the original position i
 aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply
c in the above mentioned figure at point p income = consumption which is known as to be a break-even point
the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e where aggregate demand = aggregate supply
consequently national income will increase
as we know positive relationship exists between national income and consumption so consumption will increase which will thereby increase the aggregate demand till we reach the equilibrium
e as against it when ad < as at y then there would be stockpiling and producers will produce less
national income will fall and as a result consumption will start falling which will thereby fall the aggregate demand till we reach the equilibrium
a ex-ante saving and ex-ante investment i in an economy what we plan or intend or desire to save during a particular period is called ex- ante saving
ii against it what we plan or intend or desire to invest during a particular period is called ex-ante investment
b ex-post saving and ex-post investment
i in an economy what we actually save or what is left after deducting consumption expenditure from income is called ex-post or realized saving
ii as against it what we actually invest or what we actually add to the physical assets of an economy is called ex-post or realized investment
determination of equilibrium level of national income through saving-investment approach a it refers to the point that has come to be established under the given condition of aggregate demand and aggregate supply and has tendency to stick to that level under this given condition where aggregate demand ad= aggregate supply as
ad = as consumption c + investment i = consumption c + saving s i = s b if due to some disturbance we divert from that position the economic forces will work in such a manner so as to drive us back to the original position i
 saving is equal to investment
c in the above figure the equilibrium level of national income is attained at point e where saving = investment which is derived from a point where ad = as
d if due to some disturbance we divert from our position like when investment > saving at y then production will have to be increased to meet the excess demand
consequently national income will increase leading to rise in saving until saving becomes equal to investment
it is here that equilibrium level of income is established because what the savers intend to save becomes equal to what the investors intend to invest
national income will fall and as a result saving will start falling until it becomes equal to investment
it is here the equilibrium level of income is derived
effective demand the level at which the economy is in equilibrium i
 where aggregate demand = aggregate supply is called effective demand
it can also be explained with the help of the following table paradox of thrift it’s reasons with numirical example 
the term thrift means savings and the paradox of thrift shows how an attempt by the economy as a whole to save more out of its current income will ultimately results in lower savings for the economy
if all the people in the economy make an effort to save more then the total savings of the community will not increase on the contrary they will decrease
this is called the paradox of thrift
reasons for “paradox of thrift” to operate a as we know that one person’s expenditure is another person’s income
b if individual ‘a’ decides to save more by reducing his consumption expenditure the income of individual ‘b’ will be less and individual ‘b’ in turn will spend less
c thus if all individuals in the economy decide to save more the income received by each individual will be less and overall income will fall and also lower will be the total savings
so saving curve shifts up and left from s to
equilibrium national income falls from y to yr the thing which has to be remembered is that savings is equal to autonomous investment that is remains unchanged
b paradox of thrift is possible when investment is induced in figure b we have induced investment function which makes the investment curve upward positively sloping
with the increase in savings not only the equilibrium income falls but also savings decline
numerical illustration suppose the original savings function is given as s = - + 
y and investment i =  + 
equilibrium level of income will be attained at the level where saving = investment  - + 
y =  + 
y =  y =  therefore savings at y= will be s = - + 
  =  suppose eveiy individual in the economy decides to save  more at each level of income
the new savings function will be s = - +  + 
y – - + 
the new equilibrium income will be attained at the level where s = i - + 
y =  + 
y =  y =  therefore savings at y =  will be s = - + 
  = - +  =  thus when everybody in the economy decides to save more the equilibrium level of income falls and the total savings also fall
this is called the paradox of thrift
elements in understanding investment marginal efficiency of investment and market rate of interest investment demand function 
elements in understanding investment a private investor’s demand for investment depends on two things a the rate of return on investment or m
i the expected rate of return from’an additional unit of investment is called marginal efficiency of investment m
it is defined as the expected rate of return of an additional unit of capital goods
i is very important factor in determining the investment demand
is determined by two factors
i supply price the cost of replacing the machine under consideration with a brand new machine is known its supply price
for example if a machine of rs
 lakh is replaced in place of old machine then rs
 lakh is the supply price
ii prospective yields it refers to expected net returnsof all costs from the capital asset over its lifetime
for example if the given machine is expected to yield revenue of rs
 and running expenditure is rs
 the prospective yield will be  –  = 
there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
higher interest implies lower level of investment demand
c decision whether to invest or not i the investor goes on making additional investments until m
i becomes equal to the rate of interest
i is greater than the rate of interest the investors has to increase the investment and if the rate is higher than the m
i no investment is to be made
ii for example if an entrepreneur has to pay % market rate of interest on the loan taken by him and he expected rate of profit i
is % then he will surely go for the investment and will continue making investment till m
= rate of interest roi
investment demand function investment demand function is the relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
higher interest implies lower level of investment demand
concepts of investment multiplier 
investment multiplier meaning the ratio of change in national income δy due to a change in investment δi is known as multiplier k
ex-ante saving in an economy what we plan or intend or desire to save during a particular period is called ex-ante saving
ex-ante investment in an economy what we plan or intend or desire to invest during a particular period is called ex-ante investment
expost saving in an economy what we actually save or what is left after deducting consumption expenditure from income is called ex-post or realized saving
expost investment in an economy what we actually invest or what we actually add to the physical assets of an economy is called ex-post or realized investment
effective demand the level at which the economy is in equilibrium i
 where aggregate demand = aggregate supply is called effective demand
paradox of thrift the term thrift means savings and the paradox of thrift shows how an attempt by the economy as a whole to save more out of its current income will ultimately results in lower savings for the economy
marginal efficiency of investment the expected rate of return from an additional unit of investment is called marginal efficiency of investment m
supply price the cost of replacing the machine under consideration with a brand new machine is known its supply price
prospective yields it refers to expected net returns of all costs from the capital asset over its lifetime
market rate of interest it refers to cost of funds borrowed for financing the investment
there exists inverse relationship between rate of interest and investment demand
higher interest implies lower level of investment demand
multiplier the ratio of change in national income δy due to change in investment δi is known as multiplier k
excess demand and its related concepts 
excess demand and inflationary gap a when in an economy aggregate demand exceeds “aggregate supply at full employment level” the demand is said to be an excess demand
b inflationary gap is the gap showing excess of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
it is called inflationary because it leads to inflation continuous rise in prices
c a simple example will further -clarify it
let us suppose that an imaginary economy by employing all its available resources can produce  quintals of rice
in the above diagram inflationary gap is ab because at full employment y* aggregate demand by* is greater than aggregate supplyay*
reasons or causes for excess demand the main reasons for excess demand are apparently the increase in the following components of aggregate demand a increase in household consumption demand due to rise in propensity to consume
b increase in private investment demand because of rise in credit facilities
c increase in public government expenditure
d increase in export demand
e increase in money supply or increase in disposable income
impacts or effects of excess demand on price output employment a effect on general price level excess demand gives a rise to general price level because it arises when aggregate demand is more than aggregate supply at a full employment level
there is inflation in economy showing inflationary gap
b effect on output excess demand has no effect on the level of output
economy is at full employment level and there is no idle capacity in the economy
c effect on employment there will be no change in thq
the economy is already operating at full employment equilibrium and hence there is no unemployment
measures to control the excess demand we can control the excess demand with the help of the following policy a monetary policy b fiscal policy let us discuss it in detail a monetary policy monetary policy is the policy of the central bank of a countiy to control money supply and availability of credit in the economy
the central bank can take the following steps i quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of moneycredit in the economy
these instruments do not direct or restrict the flow of credit to some specific sectors of the economy
they are as under • bank rate or discount rate increase in bank rate -> bank rate is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral security for purpose of loan
the thing which has to be remembered is that central bank lends to commercial banks and not to general public
-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation -> central bank raises bank rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
❖ it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates which discourages borrowers from taking loans which discourages investment
❖ again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
❖ thus expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced which will control the excess demand
-> these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
-> it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price
-> so keeping securities and borrowing is repo rate
-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation ❖ central bank raises repo rate that discourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will increase the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
❖ it forces the commercial banks to increase their lending rates which discourages borrowers from taking loans which discourages investment
❖ again high rate of interest induces households to increase their savings by restricting expenditure on consumption
❖ thus expenditure on investment and consumption is reduced which will control the excess demand
• reverse repo rate increase in reverse repo rate -> it is the rate at which the central bank rbi borrows money from commercial bank
-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation reverse repo rate is increased it encourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank to earn higher return on idle cash
it decreases the lending capability of commercial banks which controls excess demand
• open market operations omo sale of securities -> it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
-> in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation central bank sells government securities and bonds to commercial bank
with the sale of these securities the power of commercial bank of giving loans decreases which will control excess demand
• increase in varying reserve requirements or legal reserve ratio -> banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank which is known as legal reserve ratio
one is the cash reserve ratio or crr and the other is the slr or statutory liquidity ratio
-> cash reserve ratio increase in crr ❖ it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits which it is required to keep with the central bank
commercial banks have to keep with the central bank a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash reserves as a matter of law
❖ for example if the minimum reserve ratio is % and total deposits of a certain bank is rs
 crore it will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank
❖ in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation cash reserve ratio crr is raised to  per cent the bank will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy which will control excess demand
-> statutory liquidity ratio increase slr ❖ it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves
❖ in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation the central bank increases statutory liquidity ratio slr which will reduce the cash resources of commercial bank and reducing credit availability in the economy
they are as under i imposing margin requirement on secured loans increase • business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
it always pays less value than the security
• so the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation central bank raises marginal requirements
this discourages borrowing because it makes people get less credit against their securities
ii moral suasion • moral suasion implies persuasion request informal suggestion advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation it appeals for credit contraction
iii selective credit control scc introduce credit rationing • in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
• in a situation of excess demand leading to inflation the central bank introduces rationing of credit in order to prevent excessive flow of credit particularly for speculative activities
it helps to wipe off the excess demand
b fiscal policy the expenditure and revenue policy taken by the general government to accomplish the desired goals is known as fiscal policy
a general government can take the following steps a revenue policy increase taxes i revenue policy is expressed in terms of taxes
ii during inflation the government impose higher amount of taxes causing the decrease in purchasing power of the people
iii it is so because to control excess demand we have to reduce the amount of liquidity from the economy
b expenditure policy reduces expenditure i government has to invest huge amount on public works like roads buildings irrigation works etc
ii during inflation government should curtail reduce its expenditure on public works like roads buildings irrigation works thereby reducing the money income of the people and their demand for goods and services
c increase in public borrowingpublic debt i this measure means that government should raise loans from public and hence borrowing decreases the purchasing power of people by leaving them with lesser amount of money
ii so government should resort to more public borrowing during excessive demand
iii government should make long term debts more attractive so that public may use their excess liquidity amount of money in purchasing these bonds which will reduce the liquidity amount of money in the economy and thereby inflation could be controlled deficient demand and its related concepts 
deficient demand or deflationary gap a when in an economy aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply at full employment level the demand is said to be a deficient demand
it is called deflationary because it leads to deflation continuous fall in prices
c let us suppose that an imaginary economy by employing all its available resources can produce  quintals of rice
if aggregate demand of rice is say  quin tals this demand will be called a deficient demand and the gap of  quintals will be called as deflationary gap
clearly here equilibrium between ad and as is at a point less than level of full employment
keynes called it an under employment equilibrium
reasons or causes for deficient demand the main reasons for deficient demand are apparently the decrease in four components of aggregate demand a decrease in household consumption demand due to fall in propensity to consume
b decrease in private investment demand because of fall in credit facilities
c decrease in public government expenditure
d decrease in export demand
e decrease in money supply or decrease in disposable income
impacts or effects of deficient demand a effect on general price level deficient demand causes the general price level to fall because it arises when aggregate demand is less than aggregate supply at full employment level
there is deflation in an economy showing deflationary gap
b effect on employment due to deficient demand investment level is reduced which causes involuntary unemployment in the economy due to fall in the planned output
c effect on output low level of investment and employment implies low level of output
measures to control the deficient demand we can control the deficient demand with the help of the following policies a monetary policy b fiscal policy let us discuss it in detail a monetary policy monetary policy is the policy of the central bank of a country of controlling money supply and availability of credit in the economy
the central bank takes the following steps i quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of moneycredit in the economy
these instruments do not direct or restrict the flow of credit to some specific sectors of the economy
the thing which has to be remembered is that central bank lends to commercial banks and not to general public
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation ❖ central bank decreases bank rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
❖ decrease in bank rate makes commercial bank to decrease their lending rates which encourages borrowers from taking loans which encourages investment
❖ again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
❖ thus expenditure on investment and consumption increase which will control the deficient demand
• repo rate decrease repo rate -> repo rate is the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
-> these securities are pledged as a security for the loans
-> it is called repurchase rate as this involves commercial bank selling securities to rbi to borrow the money with an agreement to repurchase them at a later date and at a predetermined price
-> so keeping securities and borrowing is repo rate
in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation ❖ central bank decreases repo rate that encourages commercial banks in borrowing from central bank as it will decrease the cost of borrowing of commercial bank
❖ decrease in repo rate makes commercial banks to decrease their lending rates which encourages borrowers from taking loans which encourages investment
❖ again low rate of interest induces households to decrease their savings by increasing expenditure on consumption
❖ thus expenditure on investment and consumption increase which will control the deficient demand
• reverse repo rate decrease reverse repo rate -> it is the rate at which the central bank rbi borrows money from commercial bank
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation reverse repo rate is decreased it discourages the commercial bank to park their funds with the central bank
it increases the lending capability of commercial banks which controls deficient demand
• open market operation purchase of securities -> it consists of buying and selling of government securities and bonds in the open market by central bank
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation central bank purchases government securities and bonds from commercial bank
with the purchase of these securities the power of commercial bank of giving loans increases which will control deficient demand
• decrease in varying reserve requirements -> banks are obliged to maintain reserves with the central bank which is known as legal reserve ratio
one is the cash reserve ratio or crr and the other is the slr or statutory liquidity ratio
-> cash reserve ratio decrease ❖ it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits which is required to keep with the central bank
commercial banks have to keep with the central bank a certain percentage of their deposits in the form of cash reserves as a matter of law
 crore it will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank
❖ in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation cash reserve ratio crr falls to  per cent the bank will have to keep rs
 crore with the central bank which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increasing credit availability in the economy which will control deficient demand
-> the statutory liquidity ratio slr increase ❖ it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves
❖ in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation the central bank decreases statutory liquidity ratio slr which will increase the cash resources of commercial bank and increases credit availability in the economy
ii qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
they are as under • imposing margin requirement on secured loans decrease -> business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
it always pays less value than the security
-> so the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation central bank decreases marginal requirements
this encourages borrowing because it makes people get more credit against their securities
• moral suasion -> moral suasion implies persuasion request informal suggestion advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank
> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation it appeals for credit expansion
• selective credit controls sccs -> in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors
-> in a situation of deficient demand leading to deflation the central bank withdraws rationing of credit and make efforts to encourage credit
fiscal policy the expenditure and revenue policy taken by the general government to accomplish the desired goals is known as fiscal policy
a general government has to take the following steps a revenue policy decrease in taxes i revenue policy is expressed in terms of taxes
ii during deflation the government will impose lower amount of taxes so that purchasing power of the people be increased
iii it is so because to control deficient demand we have to increase the amount of liquidity in the economy
b expenditure policy increase in expenditure i government has to invest huge amount on public works like roads buildings irrigation works etc
ii during deflation government should increase its expenditure on public works like roads buildings irrigation works thereby increasing the money income of the people and their demand for goods and services
ii people will have more money and more purchasing power
iii in brief during period of deficient demand government should adopt the pricing of deficit budget
iv old taken debts from public should be finished and paid back to increase money in the market
full employment voluntary unemployment and involuntary unemployment 
full employment i full employment equilibrium refers to the situation where aggregate demand is equal to aggregate supply and all those who are able to work and willing to work at the existing wage rate are getting work
ii full employment doesn’t means that there is no unemployment in an economy
unemployment also exists at full employment level because of voluntary unemployment
voluntary unemployment i voluntary unemployment refers to the situation when a person is unemployed because he is not willing to work at the existing wage rate even when work is available
ii suppose if the market wage rate for mba in the industries is rs
 a month but some of the qualified mba’s refuse to accept job at rs
 a month they will be considered as voluntarily unemployed
involuntary unemployment i involuntary unemployment refers to a situation in which all able and willing persons to work at existing wage-rate do not find work
excess demand when in an economy aggregate demand exceeds “aggregate supply at full employment level” the demand is said to be an excess demand
inflationary gap it is the gap showing excess of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
it is called inflationary because it leads to inflation continuous rise in prices
deficient demand when in an economy aggregate demand falls short of aggregate supply at full employment level the demand is said to be a deficient demand
deflationary gap it is the gap showing deficient of current aggregate demand over ‘aggregate supply at the level of full employment’
it is called deflationary because it leads to deflation continuous fall in prices
monetary policy it is the policy of the central bank of a country to control money supply and availability of credit in the economy
quantitative instruments or general tools of monetary policy these are the instruments of monetary policy that affect overall supply of moneycredit in the economy
qualitative instruments or selective tools of monetary policy these instruments are used to regulate the direction of credit
bank rate it is the rate of interest at which central bank lends to commercial banks without any collateral security for purpose of loan
repo rate it is the rate at which commercial bank borrow money from the central bank for short period by selling their financial securities to the central bank
reverse repo rate it is the rate at which the central bank rbi borrows moneyfrom commercial bank
cash reserve ratio it refers to the minimum percentage of a bank’s total deposits which it is required to keep with the central bank
statutory liquidity ratio it refers to minimum percentage of net total demand and time liabilities which commercial banks are required to maintain with themselves
marginal requirement business and traders get credit from commercial bank against the security of their goods
bank never gives credit equal to the full value of the security
it always pays less value than the security
so the difference between the value of security and value of loan is called marginal requirement
moral suasion it implies persuasion request informal suggestion advice and appeal by the central banks to commercial banks to cooperate with general monetary policy of the central bank 
selective credit control in this method the central bank can give directions to the commercial banks not to give credit for certain purposes or to give more credit for particular purposes or to the priority sectors

involuntary unemployment it refers to a situation in which all able and willing persons to work at existing wage-rate do not find work
a government budget is an annual financial statement showing item wise estimates of expected revenue and anticipated expenditure during a fiscal year
budget has two parts a receipts and b expenditure
objectives of budget a activities to secure a reallocation of resources i private enterprises always desire to allocate resources to those areas of production where profits are high
ii however it is possible that such areas of production like production of alcohol may not promote social welfare
iii through its budgetary policy the government of a country directs the allocation of resources in a manner such that there is a balance between the goals of profit maximisation and social welfare
iv production of goods which are injurious to health like cigarettes and whisky is discouraged through heavy taxation
v on the other hand production of “socially useful goods” like electricity ‘khadi’ is encouraged through subsidies
vi so finally government has to reallocate resources in accordance to social and economic considerations in case the free market fails to do or does so inefficiently
b redistributive activities i budget of a government shows its comprehensive exercise on the taxation and subsidies
ii a government uses fiscal instruments of taxation and subsidies with a view of improving the distribution of income and wealth in the economy
iii a government reduces the inequality in the distribution of income and wealth by imposing taxes on the rich and giving subsidies to the poor or spending more on welfare of the poor
iv it reduces income of the rich and raises the living standard of the poor thus leads to equitable distribution of income
v expenditure on special anti poverty and employment schemes will be increased to bring more people above poverty line
vii so finally equitable distribution of income and wealth is a sign of social justice which is the principal objective of any welfare state in india
c stabilising activities i free play of market forces or the forces of supply and demand are bound to generate trade cycles also called business cycles
ii these refer to the phases of recession depression recovery and boom in the economy
hi the government of a country is always committed to save the economy from business cycles
budget is used as an important policy instrument to combatsolve the situations of deflation and inflation
iv by doing it the government tries to achieve the state of economic stability
v economic stability leads to more investment and increases the rate of growth and development
d management of public enterprises i a government undertakes commercial activities that are of the nature of natural monopolies and which are established and managed for social welfare of the public
ii a natural monopoly is a situation where there are economies of scale over a large range of output
iii industries which are potential natural monopolies are railways etc
importance of a budget a today every country aims at its economic growth to improve living standard of its people
besides there are many other problems such as poverty unemployment inequalities in incomes and wealth etc
government strives hard to solve these problems through budgetary measures
b the budget shows the fiscal policy
itemwise estimates of expenditure discloses how much and on what items the government is going to spend
similarly itemwise details of government receipts indicate the sources from where the government intends to get money to finance the expenditure
in this way budget is the most important instrument in hands of governments to achieve their objectives and there lies the importance of the government budget
note fiscal year is the year in which country’s budgets are prepared
its duration is from st april to st march
types of budget it may be of two types a balanced budget b unbalanced budget let us discuss them in detail a balanced budget if the government revenue is just equal to the government expenditure made by the general government then it is known as balanced budget
b unbalanced budget if the government expenditure is either more or less than a government receipts the budget is known as unbalanced budget
it may be of two types i surplus budget ii deficit budget let us discuss them in detail i surplus budget if the revenue received by the general government is more in comparison to expenditure it is known as surplus budget
ii deficit budget if the expenditure made by the general government is more than the revenue received then it is known as deficit budget
in other words in deficit budget government expenditure is in excess of government income
components of government budget budget receipts its types 
components of a government budget government budget comprises of two parts— a revenue budget and b capital budget
a revenue budget revenue budget contains both types of the revenue receipts of the government i
 tax revenue and non tax revenue  and the revenue expenditure
i revenue receipts these are the receipts that neither create any liability nor reduction in assets of the government
it includes tax revenues like income tax corporation tax and non-tax revenue like fines and penalties special assessment escheat etc
ii revenue expenditure an expenditure that neither creates any assets nor cause reduction of liability is called revenue expenditure
b capital budget capital budget contains capital receipts and capital expenditure of the government
i capital receipts government receipts that either creates liabilities of payment of loan or reduce assets on disinvestment are called capital receipts
capital receipts include items which are non- repetitive and non-routine in nature
ii capital expenditure this expenditure of the government either creates physical or financial assets or reduction of its liability
acquisition of assets like land machinery equipment its loans and advances to state governments etc
budget receipts government receipt budget receipt refers to the estimated receipts of the government from various sources during a fiscal year
it shows the sources from where the government intends to get money to finance the expenditure
in revenue receipts both the conditions should be satisfied
• revenue receipts include items which are repetitive and routine in nature
ii revenue receipts are further classified into • tax revenue -> tax revenue refers to receipts from all kinds of taxes such as income tax corporate tax excise duty etc
-> a tax is a legally compulsory payment imposed by the government on income and profit of persons and companies without reference to any benefit
taxes are of two types direct taxes and indirect taxes
• non-tax revenue -> non-tax revenue refers to government revenue from all sources other than taxes
-> these are incomes which the government gets by way of sale of goods and services rendered by different government departments
-> components of non-tax revenue ♦ commercial revenue profit and interest ♦ it is the revenue received by the government by selling the goods and services produced by the government agencies
♦ for example profit of public sector undertakings like railways bhel lic etc
♦ government gives loan to state government union territories private enterprises and to general public and earns interest receipts from these loans
♦ it also includes interest and dividends on investments made by the government
♦ administrative revenue the revenue that arises on account of the administrative function of the government
this includes ♦ fee fee refers to a payment made to the government for the services that it renders to the citizens
such services are generally in public interest and fees are paid by those who receive such services
for example passport fees court fees school fees in government schools
♦ license fee license fee is a payment to grant a permission by a government authority
for example registration fee for an automobile
 they are imposed on law breakers
♦ special assessment sometimes government undertakes developmental activities by which value of nearby property appreciates which leads to increase in wealth
so it is the payment made by owners of those properties whose value has appreciated
for example if value of a property near a metro station has increased then a part of developmental expenditure made by government is recovered from owners of such property
this is the value of special assessment
♦ forfeitures are in the form of penalties imposed by courts that a person needs to pay in the court of law for failing to comply with court orders
♦ escheat refers to the claim of the government on the property of a person who dies without having any legal heir or without leaving a will
such grants and gifts are received during national crisis such as earthquakes flood war etc
b capital receipts i meaning • government receipts that either creates liabilities of payment of loan or reduce assets on disinvestment are called capital receipts
in capital receipts any one of the conditions must be satisfied
• capital receipts include items which are non-repetitive and non-routine in nature ii components • borrowing domestic and external borrowings are made to meet the financial requirement of the country
a government may borrow money -> domestically general public by issuing government bonds in the open market
-> externally rest of the world foreign government and international institutions • recovery of loans and advances loans offered to others are assets of the government
it includes recovery of loans granted by the central government to state and union territory governments
it is a capital receipt because it reduces financial assets of the government
for example the government of india may give rs
 crore as a loan to the government of delhi
here the value of asset is rs
when the government of delhi repaid rs
 crore the value of the government of india assets reduces to rs
since recovery of loan reduces the value of assets it is termed as a capital receipts
• disinvestment a government raises funds from disinvestment also
disinvestment means selling whole or a part of the shares i
 equity of selected public sector enterprises held by government
as a result government assets are reduced
foreign exchange refers to all the currencies of the rest of the world other than the domestic currency of the country
for example in india us dollar is the foreign exchange
the rate at which one currency is exchanged for another is called foreign exchange rate
in other words the foreign exchange rate is the price of one currency stated in terms of another currency
for example if one u
s dollar exchanges for  indian rupees then the rate of exchange is $ = rs
 or  rs =  or 
foreign exchange market is the market where the national currencies are converted exchanged or traded for one another
functions of a foreign exchange market a transfer function transfer function refers to transferring of purchasing power among countries
b credit function it implies provision of credit in terms of foreign exchange for the export and import of goods and services across different countries of the world
c hedging function hedging function pertains to protecting against foreign exchange risks
where hedging is an activity which is designed to minimize the risk of loss
sources of demand of foreign exchange the demand or outflow of foreign exchange comes from the people who need it to make payments in foreign currencies
it is demanded by the domestic residents for the following reasons a imports of goods and services when india imports goods and services foreign exchange is demanded to make the payment for imports of goods and services
b tourism foreign exchange is demanded to meet expenditure incurred in foreign tours
c unilateral transfers sent abroad foreign exchange is required for making unilateral transfers like sending gifts to other countries
d purchase of assets in foreign countries it is demanded to make payment for purchase of assets like land shares bonds etc
e repayment of loans to foreigners as and when we have to pay interest and repay the loans to foreign lenders we require foreign exchange
d speculation demand for foreign exchange arises when people want to make gains from appreciation of currency
reasons for ‘rise in demand’ for foreign currency the demand for foreign currency rises in the following situations a when price of a foreign currency falls imports from that foreign country become cheaper
so imports increase and hence the demand for foreign currency rises
for example if price of  us dollar falls from rs
 then imports from the usa will increase as american goods will become relatively cheaper
it will raise the demand for us dollar
b when a foreign currency becomes cheaper in terms of the domestic currency it promotes tourism to that country
as a result demand for foreign currency rises
c when price of a foreign currency falls its demand rises as more people want to make gains from speculative activities
demand curve of foreign exchange is downward sloping a demand curve of foreign exchange slopes downwards due to inverse relationship between demand for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate
b in figure demand for foreign exchange us dollar and rate of foreign exchange are shown on the horizontal axis and vertical axis respectively
c the demand curve us$ is downward sloping
it means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increase d this is due to the fact that rise in the price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods which make them more expensive
as a result imports decline
thus the demand for foreign exchange also decreases
sources of supply of foreign exchange the supply inflow of foreign exchange comes from the people who receive it due to the following reasons
a exports of goods and services supply of foreign exchange comes through exports of goods and services
b tourism the amount which foreigners spend in the home country increases the supply of foreign exchange
c remittances unilateral transfers from abroad supply of foreign exchange increases in the form of gifts and other remittances from abroad
d loan from rest of the world it refers to borrowing from abroad
to india which will increase supply of foreign exchange
e foreign investment the amount which foreigners invest in our home country increases the supply of foreign exchange
f speculation supply of foreign exchange comes from those who want to speculate on the value of foreign exchange
reasons of‘rise in supply’ of foreign currency the supply of foreign currency rises in the following situations a when price of a foreign currency rises domestic goods become relatively cheaper
it induces the foreign country to increase their imports from the domestic country
as a result supply of foreign currency rises
for example if price of  us dollar rises from rs
it will raise the supply of us dollars
b when price of a foreign currency rises foreign direct investment fdi
from rest of the world increases which will increase the supply for foreign exchange
c when price of a foreign currency rises supply of foreign currency also rises as people want to make gains from speculative activities
supply curve of foreign exchange is upward sloping a supply curve of foreign exchange slopes upwards due to positive relationship between supply for foreign exchange and foreign exchange rate which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases
b this makes home country’s goods become cheaper to foreigners since rupee is depreciating in value
the demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases
c the increased demand for our exports will translate into greater supply of foreign exchange
thus the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases
how foreign exchange is determine disequilibrium conditions under exchange rate 
determination of foreign exchange rate a exchange rate in a free exchange market is determined at a point where demand for foreign exchange is equal to the supply of foreign exchange
b let us assume that there are two countries – india and u
a – and the exchange rate of their currencies i
 rupee and dollar is to be determined
presently there is floating or flexible exchange regime in both india and u
therefore the value of currency of each country in terms of the other currency depends upon the demand for and supply of their currencies
c in the above diagram the price on the vertical axis is stated in terms of domestic currency that is how many rupees for one us dollar
the horizontal axis measures the quantity demanded or supplied
d in the above diagram the demand curve d$ is downward sloping
this means that less foreign exchange is demanded as the exchange rate increases
this is due to the fact that the rise in price of foreign exchange increases the rupee cost of foreign goods which make them more expensive
as a result imports decline
thus the demand for foreign exchange also decreases
e the supply curve s$ is upward sloping which means that supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases
the demand for our exports should therefore increase as the exchange rate increases
the increased demand for our exports translates into greater supply of foreign exchange
thus the supply of foreign exchange increases as the exchange rate increases
disequilibrium conditions under equilibrium exchange rate achange in demand i increase in demand for dollar an increase in the demand for us dollar in india will cause the demand curve to shift to d$ and the exchange rate rises to p$
note that increase in the exchange rate means that more rupees are required to buy one us dollar
when this occurs indian rupee is said to be depreciating
b change in supply i increase in supply for dollar an increase in the supply of us dollar causes the supply curve to shift to s$ and exchange rate falls to p$
in this case rupee cost of us dollar is decreasing and the indian rupee is said to be appreciating
note that decrease in the exchange rate means that less rupees are required to buy one us dollar
when this occurs indian rupee is said to be appreciating
ii decrease in supply of dollar a decrease in the supply of us dollar causes the supply curve to shift to s$ and exchange rate rises to p$
exchange rate regimes fixed flexible and managed floating exchange rate and their merits and demerits types of exchange rate regimes 
fixed exchange rate system pegged exchange rate system a meaning i the system of exchange rate in which exchange rate is officially declared and fixed by the government is called fixed exchange rate system
ii when domestic currency is tied to the value of foreign currency it is known as pegging
iii to maintain stability in fixed exchange rate system government buy foreign currency when exchange rate appreciates and sell foreign currency when exchange rate depreciate
this process is called pegging operation i
 all efforts made by the central bank to keep the rate of exchange stable
note i fixed exchange rate is not determined by the forces of demand and supply in the market
such a rate of exchange has been associated with gold standard system during -
ii according to this system value of every currency is determined in terms of gold
accordingly ratio between gold value of the two countries was fixed as exchange rate between those currencies
iii for example value of one dollar =  gms of gold
value of a rupee =  gms of gold then  dollar =  = rs
 b merits of fixed exchange rate system i stability it ensures stability in the international money marketexchange market
day to day fluctuations are avoided
it helps formulation of long term economic policies particularly relating to exports and imports
ii encourages international trade fixed exchange rate system implies low risk and low uncertainty of future payments
long term economic policies can be drawn in the area of international trade and bilateral trade agreements
c demerits of fixed exchange rate system i huge international reserves fixed exchange rate system is often supported with huge international reserves of gold
this is because different currencies are directly or indirectly convertible into gold
ii restricted movement of capital fixed exchange rate restricts the movement of capital across different parts of the world
accordingly international growth process suffers
v iii discourages venture capital venture capital in the international money market refers to investments in the purchase of foreign exchange in the international money market with a view to earn profits
fixed exchange rate system discourages such investments
fixed exchange rate discourages venture capital in the international money market
d devaluation of currency devaluation refers to decrease in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency by the government
it is a part of fixed exchange rate
e revaluation of currency revaluation refers to increase in the value of domestic currency by the central government
it is a part of fixed exchange rate
flexible exchange rate floating exchange rate system a meaning i the system of exchange rate in which value of a currency is allowed to float freely as determined by demand for and supply of foreign exchange is called flexible exchange rate system
ii under this system the central banks without intervention allow the exchange rate to adjust to equate the supply and demand for foreign currency
iii the foreign exchange market is busy at all times by changes in the exchange rates
b merits of flexible exchange rate system i no need for international reserves flexible exchange rate system is not to be supported with international reserves
ii international capital movements flexible exchange rate system enhances movement of capital across different countries of the world
this is due to the fact that member countries are no longer required to keep huge international reserves
iii venture capital flexible exchange rate promotes venture capital in foreign exchange market
trading in international currencies itself becomes an important economic activity
c demerits of flexible exchange rate system i instability it causes instability in the international money market
exchange rate tends to fluctuate like price of goods in the commodity market
ii international trade instability in foreign exchange market causes instability in the area of international trade
it becomes difficult to draw long period policies of exports and imports
iii macro policies while fixed exchange rate helps coordination of macro policies flexible exchange rate makes it a difficult proposition
day to day fluctuations in exchange rate makes bilateral trade agreements a difficult exercise
it makes the domestic currency less valuable and more of it is required to buy a foreign currency
it is a part of flexible exchange rate
ii for example rupee is said to be depreciating if price of $ rises from   to rs
iii effect of depreciation of domestic currency on exports depreciation of domestic currency means a fall in the price of domestic currency say rupee in terms of a foreign currency say $
it means with the same amount of dollars more goods can be purchased from india i
 exports to usa will increase as they will become relatively cheaper
e currency appreciation i currency appreciation refers to increase in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency
the domestic currency becomes more valuable and less of it is required to buy a-foreign currency
it is a part of flexible exchange rate
ii for example indian rupee appreciates when price of $ falls from rs
iii effect of appreciation of domestic currency on imports appreciation of domestic currency means a rise in the price of domestic currency say rupee in terms of a foreign currency say $
now one rupee can be exchanged for more $ i
 with the same amount of money more goods can be purchased from the usa
it leads to increase in imports from the usa as american goods will become relatively cheaper
managed floating rate system a managed floating exchange rate is a mixture of a flexible exchange rate the float part and a fixed exchange rate the managed part
b in other words it refers to a system in which foreign exchange is determined by free market forces demand and supply forces which can be influenced by the intervention of the central bank in foreign exchange market
c under this system also called dirty floating central banks intervene to buy or sell foreign currencies in an attempt to stabilize exchange rate movements in case of extreme appreciation or depreciation
kinds of foreign exchange rate spot and forward market 
spot market for foreign exchange a if the operation is of daily nature it is called spot market or current market
b the exchange rate that prevails in the spots market for foreign exchange is called spot rate
c in other words spot rate of exchange refers to the rate at which foreign currency is available on the spot
forward market for foreign exchange a a market for foreign exchange for future delivery is known as forward market
b exchange rate that prevails in a forward contract for purchase or sale of foreign exchange is called forward rate
c thus forward rate is the rate at which a future contract for foreign currency is bought and sold
other types of exchange rate system 
wider band system a it is a system that allows wider adjustment in the fixed exchange rate system
c for example if one us dollar is fixed as equal to fifty indian rupees % revision upward or downward is to be allowed in this exchange rate of  
exchange rate may be revised as   + % =   or as   – % =    
crawling peg system a it allows “small” but regular adjustments in the exchange rate for different currencies
b not more than + % adjustment is allowed at a time
indeed it is a small adjustment
c but it can crawl i
 it can be repeated at regular intervals
nominal exchange rate ner the number of units of domestic currency required to purchase a unit of foreign currency is called nominal exchange rate
it may move to $ = rs
nominal effective exchange rate neer a the concept is useful for an aggregative analysis
a nation has to deal with a number of countries and hence a number of currencies
b for example during a period indian rupee may be losing value against the american dollar but it may be gaining value against euro
c therefore we would be interested in knowing what is happening in aggregate to our rupee i
 is it gaining or losing
d for this purpose we prepare a basket of all the currencies which we are interested in and find out the average of the changes in these currencies in a given period
this gives us the nominal effective exchange rate neer
e so finally neer is the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to other currencies without eliminating the effect of change in price
real exchange rate rer rer is the exchange rate which is calculated after eliminating the effects of price change
therefore rer is based on constant prices
real effective exchange rate reer reer is the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to other currencies after eliminating the effects of price change
parity value in the context of exchange rate in foreign exchange market parity value refers to the value of one currency in terms of the other for a given basket of goods and services
dollar buys  times the goods and services in india compared to a rupee the parity value of a us dollar should be   
accordingly the exchange rate between rupee and a us dollar ought to be rs
any change in the parity value would imply a corresponding change in exchange rate
foreign exchange it refers to all the currencies of the rest of the world other than the domestic currency of the country
for example in india us dollar is the foreign exchange
foreign exchange rate the rate at which one currency is exchanged for another is called foreign exchange rate
foreign exchange market it is the market where the national currencies are converted exchanged or traded for one another
hedging function hedging function pertains to protecting against foreign exchange risks where hedging is an activity which is designed to minimize the risk of loss
fixed exchange rate system the system of exchange rate in which exchange rate is officially declared and fixed by the government is called fixed exchange rate system
pegging when domestic currency is tied to the value of foreign currency it is known as pegging
pegging operations it refers to all efforts made by the central government to keep the rate of exchange stable
venture capital venture capital in the international money market refers to investments in the purchase of foreign exchange in the international money market with a view to earn profits
devaluation it refers to decrease in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency by the government
it is a part of fixed exchange rate
revaluation it refers to increase in the value of domestic currency by the central government
it is a part of fixed exchange rate
flexible exchange rate the system of exchange rate in which value of a currency is allowed to float freely as determined by demand for and supply of foreign exchange is called flexible exchange rate system
currency depreciation it refers to decrease in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency
it makes the domestic currency less valuable and more of it is required to buy a foreign currency
it is a part of flexible exchange rate
currency appreciation it refers to increase in the value of domestic currency in terms of foreign currency
the domestic currency becomes more valuable and less of it is required to buy a foreign currency
it is a part of flexible exchange rate
managed floating exchange rate it is a mixture of a flexible exchange rate the float part and a fixed exchange rate the managed part
spot rate if the operation is of daily nature it is called spot market or current market
forward rate a market for foreign exchange for future delivery is known as forward market
nominal exchange rate ner the number of units of domestic currency required to purchase a unit of foreign currency is called nominal exchange rate
nominal effective exchange rate neer it is the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to other currencies without eliminating the effect of change in price
real exchange rate rer it is the exchange rate which is calculated after eliminating the effects of price change
therefore rer is based on constant prices
real effective exchange rate reer it is the measure of average relative strength of a given currency with respect to other currencies after eliminating the effects of price changes
parity value it refers to the value of one currency in terms of the other for a given basket of goods and services
thereafter explaining balance of trade and its differences with the balance of payment autonomous items accommodating items and their differences disequilibrium in balance of payment
balance of payment its structure and components 
the balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions between its residents and residents of the foreign countries during a given period of time
note economic transactions are the transactions which cause transfer of value
example when exports of goods or services are made by country a to country b value = export receipts is transferred by country b to country a
between the countries value is transferred in terms of foreign exchange i
payments are received and made in terms of foreign exchange
structure of balance payment accounting a transactions are recorded in the balance of payments accounts in double-entry book keeping
b each international transaction undertaken by country will results in a credit entry and debit entry of equal size
c as international transactions are recorded in double entry accounting the bop accounting must always balance i
 total amount of debits must be equal to total amount of credits
d the balancing item errors and omissions must be added to “balance” the bop accounts
e by convension debit items and credit items are entered with a minus sign and plus sign respectively
f transactions in bop are classified into the following five major categories i goods and services account ii unilateral transfer account iii long-term capital account iv short-term private capital account v short-term official capital account for each of these given categories specific types of transactions are shown as debits or credits
current account category-i category-ii a meaning current account records imports and exports of goods and services and unilateral transfers
b components of current account the main components of current account are i export and import of goods merchandise transactions or visible trade a major part of transactions in foreign trade is in the form of export and import of goods visible items
payment for import of goods is written on the negative side debit items and receipt from exports is shown on the positive side credit items
balance of these visible exports and imports is known as balance of trade or trade balance
ii export and import of services invisible trade it includes a large variety of non-factor services known as invisible items sold and purchased by the residents of a country to and from the rest of the world
payments are either received or made to the other countries for use of these services
services are generally of three kinds a shipping b banking and c insurance
payments for these services are recorded on the negative side and receipts on the positive side
iii unilateral or unrequisted transfers to and from abroad one sided trans¬actions unilateral transfers include gifts donations personal remittances and other ‘oneway’ transactions
these refer to those receipts and payments which take place without any service in return
receipt of unilateral transfers from rest of the world is shown on the credit side and unilateral transfers to rest of the world on the debit side
iv income receipts and payments to and from abroad it includes investment income in the form of interest rent and profits
capital account category-ill category-iv category-v a meaning capital account is that account which records all such transactions between residents of a country and rest of the world which cause a change in the asset or liability status of the residents of a country or its government
b components of capital account the main components of capital account are i loans borrowing and lending of funds are divided into two transactions • private transactions -> these are transactions that are affecting assets or liabilities by individuals businesses etc
the bulk of foreign investment is private
-> for example all transactions relating to borrowings from abroad by private sector and similarly repayment of loans by foreigners are recorded on the positive credit side
-> all transactions of lending to abroad by private sector and similarly repayment of loans to abroad by private sector is recorded as negative or debit item
• official transactions -> transactions affecting assets and liabilities by the government and its agencies
-> for example all transactions relating to borrowings from abroad by government sector and similarly repayment of loans by foreign government are recorded on the positive credit side
private and official transactions borrowing are of two components i commercial borrowings referring to borrowing by a country including government and private sector from international money market
this involves market rate of interest without considerations of any concession ii borrowings as external assistance referring to borrowing by a country with considerations of assistance
it involves lower rate of interest compared to that prevailing in open market
ii foreign investment investments to and from abroad it includes • investments by rest of the world in shares of indian companies real estate in india etc
such investments from abroad are recorded on the positive credit side as they bring in foreign exchange
• investments by indian residents in shares of foreign companies real estate abroad etc
such investments to abroad are recorded on the negative debit side as they lead to outflow of foreign exchange
‘investments to and from abroad’ includes two types of investments -> foreign direct investment fdi it refers to purchase of an asset in rest of the world such that it gives direct control to the purchaser over the asset
for example i acquisition of a firm in the domestic country by a foreign country’s firm ii transfer of funds from the parent company abroad to the subsidiary company in the domestic country
-> portfolio investment portfolio investment refers to the purchase of financial asset by the foreigners that does not give the purchaser control over the asset
a foreign institutional investment fii is also a part of portfolio investment
for instance purchase of shares of a foreign company purchase of foreign government’s bonds etc
are treated as portfolio investments
iii change in foreign exchange reserves • the foreign exchange reserves are the financial assets of the government held in • central bank
a change in reserves serves as the financing item in india’s bop
• so any withdrawal from the reserves is recorded on the positive credit side and any addition to these reserves is recorded on the negative debit side
• it must be noted that ‘change in reserves’ is recorded in the bop account and not ‘reserves’
balance of payments and its types 
balance it means difference between the sum of credits and sum of debits
the bop account records three balances a balance of trade b balance on current account c balance on capital account 
balance of trade the term “balance of trade” denotes the difference between the exports and imports of goods in a country
balance of trade refers to the visible items only
it is the difference between the value of merchandise goods exports and imports
balance of trade = export of visible goods – import of visible goods
balance on current account it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on current account
balance on capital account it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on capital account
balance on capital account = sum of credits on capital account – sum of debits on capital account autonomous and accommodating items deficit in balance of payment and disequilibrium in balance of payment 
autonomous items a autonomous items refer to those international economic transactions in the current account and capital account which take place due to some economic motive such as profit maximisation
b these transactions are independent of the state of bop account
c these items are also known as ‘above the line items’
d for example if a foreign company is making investments in india with the aim of earning profit then such a transaction is independent of the country’s bop situation
accommodating items a accommodating items refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions i
 such transactions are determined by net consequences of autonomous transactions
h these items are also known as ‘below the line items’
c for example if there is a current account deficit in bop then this deficit is settled by capital inflow from abroad
the sources used to meet a deficit in bop are i foreign exchange reserves ii borrowings from imf or foreign monetary authorities
deficit in bop a the balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions between the residents of foreign countries during a given period of time
b the transaction in the balance of payment account can be categorized as autonomous transactions and accommodating transactions
c autonomous transactions are transactions done for some economic consideration such as profit
d when the total inflows on account of autonomous transactions are less than total outflows on account of such transactions there is a deficit in the balance of payments account
e suppose the autonomous inflow of foreign exchange during the year is $ while the total outflow is $
it means that there is a deficit of $
disequilibrium in balance of payments there are a number of factors that cause disequilibrium in the balance of payments showing either a surplus or deficit
these causes are a economic factors i large scale development expenditure that may cause large imports
ii cyclical fluctuations in general business activity such as recession or depression
iii high domestic prices may result in imports
b political factors political factors instability may cause large capital outflows and hamper the inflows of foreign capital
balance of payment the balance of payments of a country is a systematic record of all economic transactions between its residents and residents of the foreign countries during a given period of time
current account it records imports and exports of goods and services and unilateral transfers
capital account capital account is that account which records all such transactions between residents of a country and rest of the world which cause a change in the asset or liability status of the residents of a country or its government
foreign direct investment it refers to purchase of an asset in rest of the world such that it gives direct control to the purchaser over the asset
portfolio investment it refers to the purchase of financial asset by the foreigners that does not give the purchaser control over the asset
balance it means difference between the sum of credits and sum of debits
balance of trade the term “balance of trade” denotes the difference between the exports and imports of goods in a country
balance of trade refers to the visible items only
balance on current account it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on current account
balance on current account = sum of credits on current account – sum of debits on current account 
balance on capital account it is the difference between sum of credits and sum of debits on capital account
balance on capital account = sum of credits on capital account – sum of debits on capital account 
autonomous items it refer to those international economic transactions in the current account and capital account which take place due to some economic motive such as profit maximisation
accommodating items it refer to the transactions that are undertaken to cover deficit or surplus in autonomous transactions i
 such transactions are determined by net consequences of autonomous transactions
