people speak different languages celebrate different festivals and eat various types of food
diversity is a reality created by individuals and groups from a broad spectrum of demographic and philosophical differences
factors influencing diversity historical and geographical factors are the two factors that influence the diversity of a region
life of people near the sea is different from the people in a mountainous area
ladakh ladakh is a land with awesome physical features and is set in an enormous and spectacular environment
it is surrounded by the world’s mightiest mountain ranges the karakoram in the north and the great himalayas in the south
kerala kerala is located in the south-western part of india
it is surrounded by sea on one side and hills on the other
unity in diversity india is a land of different religions and communities
there is a great diversity in our habits and customs and yet we all live together as indians
“unity in diversity” has been the distinctive feature of our country
everyone on earth differs from each other with respect to aspects like looks behaviour culture religion language talent etc
this means that there is diversity among people in these aspects
diversity means the lack of uniformity and the sense of variety
inequality comes about among people when they have different access to resources and opportunities
the caste system religion financial well- being education etc
are various forms of inequality in the society
since it is a very big country people in different parts differ in their customs language habits etc
these diversities arise from the fact that different regions have different histories and environments
despite the diversities listed above there are similarities that unite us
we all are indian and during the freedom struggle the whole country came together to send away the british irrespective of their diverse backgrounds
the indian national flag is the most important national symbol and it reminds us of our unity in diversity
diversity the sense of variety that exists in the traits looks behaviour culture religion language abilities resources and opportunities related to different people is said to be diversity
inequality the differences between two or more people that arise because of their abilities resources and opportunities or their caste etc
habitat the geographical area where a living being has adapted and lives comfortably is called the habitat of that living being
resources anything that can be of any use in any activity is said to be a resource
whereas prejudice is an unfavourable opinion or feeling formed beforehand or without knowledge thought or reason
stereotypes a “stereotype” is a generalisation about a person or group of persons
we resort to prejudice by ascribing characteristics to a person based on a stereotype without the knowledge of complete facts
it reduces an individual to a rigid image and does not consider the fact that human beings are complex and multidimensional with unique attributes
stereotypes suggest that people or groups of people are the same although they are quite different
caste a system of rigid social stratification characterised by hereditary status endogamy and social barriers sanctioned by customs law and religion
it refers to any of the hereditary social classes or sub-classes of traditional hindu society stratified according to hindu ritual purity namely the brahmin kshatriya vaishya and shudra castes

constitution the fundamental law written or unwritten that establishes the character of a government by defining the basic principles to which society must conform
each of the eight major world religions is followed in india
there are over  mothertongues and over a hundred dance forms
many of us are prejudiced about people that differ from us—like we think our traits religions etc
to be the best and we automatically presume that those of others are not good
this is not a healthy trait of our diversity
in prejudice we often hurt others
we also tend to create stereotypes—that is we form one particular image—positive or negative—about something without pondering over it carefully
the stereotype may be with respect to religion place of origin or residence sex race background etc
when people act in a way that is driven by their prejudices or stereotypes discrimination happens
in this we prevent people from using their rights just because we thirik they are inferior
castes were created as a result of discrimination on the basis of occupation of people
rules were created by the people who called themselves upper caste
the group at the bottom of the caste ladder were labelled as “untouchable”
the “untouchables” were not allowed to take on work other than what they were meant to do
people maintained distance from them
many dalits and women came forward to demand equality with other castes and men respectively
when india became independent the constitution was made which laid down laws for equality among all indians
prejudice the tendency to judge other people negatively or consider them inferior is said to be prejudice
stereotype when one forms a particular image—positive or negative— about something without thinking over it carefully this is said to be the stereotype
it may be with respect to one’s religion place of origin or residence sex race background etc
discrimination when people act in a way that is due to their prejudice or stereotype then discrimination takes place for example not sharing the same seat with a person of another caste is a form of discrimination
the constitution a document of national importance that laid out the rules by which the nation would function is the constitution it was prepared after india got independence
untouchability a form of discrimination in which a particular caste of people is considered impure by “upper-caste” people is called untouchability
that caste is called “untouchables”
this form of discrimination should be discouraged
the preamble the first page of the constitution that presents a “summary” of the rules by which that nation must function is called the preamble
the extract is from “dr
ambedkar’s writings and speeches” ed
it tells the story of a day when ambedkar and his companions were discriminated against just because they were untouchables
the sense of discrimination was so much that the station master who met them refused to entertain them once he got to know their caste
this is the first-hand experience of ambedkar who later came up as one of the greatest leaders of india

apartheid means separation on the basis of race
south african people were divided into white black indian and coloured races and apartheid laws prevented them from getting mixed with each other
non-white had to face several distinctions
they were not allowed to vote
neither they availed other basic privileges

 myanmar where the army rules dictator pinochet’s rule in chile or president nkrumah’s rule in • ghana was not democratic
they were not chosen by the people
 hereditary kings like the king of nepal or saudi arabia are also not democratic rulers
they rule because they were born into noble families
in a democracy final decision-making power must rest with those elected by the people
 in pakistan president musharraf had the power to dismiss national and state assemblies so the final powers rest with the army and the general himself
we cannot call it a democracy
now pakistan has an elected government
democracy must be based on a free and fair election where those currently in power have a fair chance of losing
for example in mexico elections have been held every six years since 
but the same party pri has won the elections
obviously there has been rigging and malpractices with freedom denied to the opposition
this is not what a democracy should be
in a democracy people’s will is ascertained by each adult citizen having one vote and each vote has one value
democracy is based on the fundamental principle of political equality
a democratic government rules within the limits set by constitutional and citizens’ rights
 a democratic government cannot do what it likes after winning the elections
it has to respect certain basic rules and is accountable not only to the people but also to other independent officials
why democracy points against there has been a criticism of democracy by various people
the charges are that  it creates instability by changing its leaders frequently
 democracy is about power play and political competition
there is no scope for morality
 so many people have to be consulted before any issue is resolved
 elected leaders do not know the best interest of the people
 it leads to corruption for it is based on electoral corruption
 ordinary people do not know what is good for them so decision-making should not be left to them
alternative to democracy to overcome political instability and legislative gridlock associated with democratic rule expansions of executive power and limits on democratic freedoms are been looked for
an exceptional example is that of russia’s transition from unstable democracy in the s to economic growth and political stability
 making of the indian constitution democratic constitution in south africa  nelson mandela the south african leader of african national congress fought a long battle against apartheid
 imprisoned for  years - emerged as the first president of the republic of south africa
 people struggled against the horrible discrimination practised against them by the white minority rulers
 apartheid system began to fall apart in the s
finally in  the first free multiracial elections were held
do we need a constitution  yes
a constitution has written laws accepted by people living together in a country
 it generates trust and coordination
 it specifies how a government should be constituted
 it lays down limits on the powers of the government
 it expresses the aspirations of the people about creating a good society
making of the indian constitution  from  onwards the british government passed many acts for the government of india but could not satisfy indian aspiration
 the demand for a constitution was first raised in  by the indian national congress
 in  jawaharlal nehru formulated the demand for a constituent assembly
 in  the british government recognized that indians should frame a new constitution by themselves
 participation in provincial legislatures helped indians in framing their constitution
 they also learnt what the british were denying indian citizens
the constituent assembly  elections to the constituent assembly were held in july 
ambedkar was appointed chairman of the drafting committee
 the constitution was adopted on th november  and enacted on th january  when india became a republic state
 the constitution reflects the best minds of the country
the constituent assembly was called mini- india
 every law was debated clause by clause and a consensus arrived at
 it is the longest written constitution in the world
they govern through the elected- representatives
governing through elected representatives is the most common form of democracy
electoral politics is all about understanding election of representatives need of elections and how to make election democratic
it also involves examining the role of the election commission in ensuring free and fair elections
elections the mechanism or procedure by which people choose their representatives at regular intervals is called election
if people are not satisfied with the working of the government then they can change the government in the next term of elections
procedure of elections the procedure of election can be understood by the real example of haryana assembly elections
it will show how candidates standing in election become representatives and how power can be removed from their hands
assembly election in haryana formation of new party ‘lok dal’ haryana had been ruled by congress party since 
at that time chaudhary devi lai was an opposition leader
he led movement called nyaya yudh struggle for justice and formed new party ‘lok dal’
election campaign of devi lai in election campaign of  assembly election devi lai promised voters that if his party win he would give loans to farmers and small businessmen
voters favoured lok dal as people were unhappy with the existing government they were attracted by devi lai’s promise
they voted in favour of lok dal and its partners won  out of  seats
results announced lok dal won  seats that’s why it had a clear majority in the – assembly
the party with a clear majority is invited by the governor to form the government
congress got only  seats
as the election result was announced the existing chief minister of congress resigned
devi lai became chief minister the newly elected members of legislative assembly mlas of lok dal chose devi lai as their leader
the governor invited’ devi lai to be the new chief minister
after three days of the election result he took the oath
then his government issued a government order to give loans to small farmers agricultural labourers and small businessmen
congress again forms government lok dal ruled die state for  years
in  election the party did not win people’s support
this time congress won the election and formed the government
need for elections elections are needed to elect representatives
the need of elections can be understood by imagifufig of democracy without elections
but this is not possible in any large community
nor it is possible for everyone to have the time and knowledge to take decisions on all matters
therefore in most democracies people rule through their representatives
the elections are needed for any representative democracy because  they solve the problem of assessing people on the basis of education knowledge or experience  they help in analysing that people like their representatives or not
 they ensure that the representatives rule as per the wishes of the people and make sure that those who are not working for the people do not remain their representatives
in an election the voters make many choices like  they can choose who will make laws for them
 they can choose who will form the government and take major decisions
 they can choose the party whose policies will guide the government and lawmaking
what makes an election democratic elections are held in all democratic countries and also in most of the non-democratic countries in many ways
but there is a simple list of the minimum conditions which make an election democratic like  everyone should have the right to choose a representative
it means everyone has one vote and every vote has equal value
 political parties and candidates should be free to contest elections and offer some real choices to the voters
 the choices should be offered at regular intervals
for that elections must be held regularly after a certain period
 the candidates preferred by the people only should get elected
 elections are conducted in a free and fair manner where people choose those representatives whom they really wish
political competition elections are all about competition
without competition elections would become meaningless
political competition takes place when different political parties compete to gain confidence and ultimately the vote of the voters
they make promises and give incentives to motivate the voters
this electoral competition has many demerits like  it creates a sense of disunity and factionalism groupism and party-politics in every locality
 the pressure to win electoral fights does not allow to- form useful long term policies
 the competition leads to the idea of being dragged into the unhealthy competition
that’s why good people do not enter and participate in political competition
the electoral competition also has some merits like  regular electoral competition provides incentives to political parties and leaders
if they can satisfy the voters with their work they will be able to win again
 if a political party is motivated only by the desire to be in power even then it will be forced to serve the people
 it reveals the real motive of political parties
 it gives choices to voters to choose among the best
system of elections in india in india lok sabha and vidhan sabha assembly elections are held regularly every five years

each ward elects one member of the village or the urban local body
sometimes these constituencies are counted as ‘seats’ and each constituency represents one seat in the assembly
for example when we say that ‘lok dal won  seats in haryana it means that candidates of lok dal won in  assembly constituencies in the state and thus lok dal had  mlas in the state assembly
if that happens our parliament and assemblies would be deprived of the voice of a significant section of our population
that would make our democracy less representative and less democratic
reservation for sc and st the makers of our constitution thought of a special system of reserved constituencies for the weaker sections
some constituencies are reserved for people who belong to the scheduled castes sc and scheduled tribes st
in an sc reserved constituency only someone who belongs to the scheduled castes can stand for election
similarly only those belonging to the scheduled tribes can contest an election from a constituency reserved for st
reservation in lok sabha districtlocal level a few seats in lok sabha are reserved for scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts
this number is in proportion to their share in the total population
in the year   seats are reserved for the scheduled castes and  for the scheduled tribes in lok sabha
thus the reserved seats for sc and st do not take away the legitimate share of any other social group
this system of reservation was extended later to other weaker sections at the district and local level
in many states seats in rural panchayat and urban municipalities and corporations local bodies are now reserved for other backward classes obc as well
however the proportion of seats reserved varies from state to state
similarly one-third of the seats are reserved in rural and urban local bodies for women candidates
voters list when the constituencies are decided the next step is to decide who can and who cannot vote
in a democratic election the list of those who are eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and given to everyone
this list is officially called the electoral roll and is commonly known as the voters’ list
this is an important step as it is linked to the first condition of a democratic election i
everyone should get an equal opportunity to choose representatives
all the citizens are human beings with their own needs and views
that is why all of them deserve to have an equal say in decisions that affect them
therefore everyone is given the right to vote
the right to vote falls under universal adult franchise
it means all the citizens aged  years and above can vote in an election regardless of his or her caste religion or gender
maintaining of voters’ list it is the responsibility of the government to get the names of all the eligible voters put on the voters’ list
as new persons attain voting age names are added to the voters’ list names of those who move out of a place or those who are dead are deleted
a complete revision of the list takes place every five years
this is done to ensure that it remains up to date
note some criminals and persons with unsound mind can be denied the right to vote but only in rare situations
the voters are required to carry this card when they go out to vote so that no one can vote in their place
the card has not been made compulsory for voting and
voters can show many other proofs of identity like the ration card driving’ licence or adhar card
nomination of candidates the system of our country provides almost no restrictions on anyone to contest the election
this only makes any election a democratic election
anyone who can be a voter can also become a candidate in elections
the only difference to be a voter is that the minimum age is  years while to be a candidate in the election the minimum age is  years
there are also some other restrictions on criminals but these apply in very extreme cases
political parties nominate their candidates who get the party support and symbol
party’s nomination is often called party ticket
the candidate has to fill a nomination form and give some money as a security deposit
moreover every candidate has to make a legal declaration giving full details of  educational qualifications of the candidate  details of the assets and liabilities of the candidate and hisher family and  serious criminal cases pending against the candidate
the information provided has to be made public in order to provide an opportunity to the voters to make their decision on the basis of the information provided by the candidates
electoral roll it is the voters’ list prepared by a door to door survey to include only bonafide voters and minimise the role of bogus voters
universal adult franchise every indian citizen of  years and above have the right to vote irrespective of caste creed and sex
educational qualifications for candidates there is no educational qualification for candidates for being an mp or an mla
however the relevant qualification for candidates is the ability to understand people’s concerns problems and to represent people’s interests
putting an educational qualification would go against the spirit of democracy because it would deprive a majority of the citizens right to contest elections
this is because still the majority of the indian population is uneducated
election campaign election campaign means the promotion or propaganda of the policies offers and promises that the candidates make to voters to fulfill if they are elected
in this way voters can decide the candidate to vote for
they vote for the candidate whose policies they like
in our country election campaigning takes place for a two-week period between the announcement of the final list’of candidates and the elate of polling
election meetings and political parties mobilise their supporters
this is also the period when print media and television news are full of election- related stories and debates
the election campaign is not limited to these two weeks only
political parties start preparing for elections months before they actually take place
they prepare their election manifestos
in election campaigns political parties try to focus public attention on some big issues
they want to attract the public to that issue and get them to vote for their party on that basis
slogans given by different political parties some of the successful slogans given by different political parties in various elections are given below  the congress party led by indira gahdhi gave the slogan of ‘garibi hatao’ remove poverty in the lok sabha elections of 
the party promised to reorient all the policies of the government to remove poverty from the country
 ‘save democracy’ was the slogan given by janata party in the next lok sabha election held in 
hie party promised to undo the
excesses committed during emergency and restore civil liberties
 the left front used the slogan of ‘land to the teller’ in the west bengal assembly elections held in 
 ‘protect the self-respect of the telugus’ was the slogan used by n
rama rao the leader of the telugu desam party in andhra pradesh assembly elections in 
code of conduct and laws to regulate the election campaign there are some election laws
according to these laws no party or candidate can  bribe or threaten voters  appeal to them in the name of caste or religion  use government resources for election campaign and  spend more than rs
 lakh in a constituency for a lok sabha election or rs
 lakh in a constituency in an assembly election
if any party or candidate is found practising any of the above their election can be rejected by the court even after they have won the election
in addition to the laws all the political parties in our country have agreed to a model code of conduct for an election campaign
polling on the day when dying voters cast or ‘poll’ their vote is called an election day
every person whose name is on the voters’ list can go to a nearby potting booth and cast hisher vote through a secret ballot
once the voter goes inside the booth the election official identify him her put a mark on the voter’s finger and allow him her to cast his her vote
an agent of each candidate is allowed to sit inside the polling booth and ensure that the voting takes place in a fair way
earlier voting was done by putting a stamp on the ballot paper
a ballot paper is a sheet of paper on which die names of the contesting candidates along with party name and symbols are listed
now electronic voting machines evms are used to record votes
the machine shows the names of the candidates and the party symbols
the voter has to press the button against the name of the candidate heshe wants to cast hisher vote
counting of votes once the polling is over all the evms are sealed and taken to a secure place
a few days later oft a fixed date all the evms are opened and the votes secured by each candidate are counted
the candidate who secures the highest number of votes from a constituency is declared elected
within a few hours of counting all the results are declared
in general elections the counting of votes in all constituencies takes place at the same time on the same day
within a few hours of counting all the results are declared and it becomes clear as who will form the next government
this event is reported by television channels radio and newspapers
what makes elections in india democracy there are many factors which ensure that elections held in india are democratic
an independent body ‘election commission’ responsible to conduct elections is formulated in the constitution of india
independent election commission  in our country elections are conducted by an independent and very powerful election commission ec
it enjoys the same kind of independence that the judiciary enjoys
the chief election commissioner cec is appointed by the president of india
but once appointed he is not answerable to even the president or the government powers of election commission potters enjoyed by dying election commission ate
 it takes decisions on every aspect of conduct and control of elections right from the announcement of elections to the declaration of results
 it implements the code of conduct and punishes any candidate or party that violates it
 during the election period die election commission can order the government to follow some guidelines to prevent the use and misuse of governmental power to enhance its chances to win elections or to transfer some government officials
 when on election duty government officers work under the control of the election commission and not the government
popular participation the participation and enthusiasm of people in an election is another criterion to check the quality of elections
if the election process is not free or fair people will not continue to participate in the exercise
people’s participation in election is usually measured by voter turnout figures
turnout indicates the per cent of eligible voters who actually cast their vote
in india there is greater voter turn out of poor illiterate people as compared to western democracies
acceptance of election outcome the outcome of elections-the final test of the free and fairness of it
if elections are not free or fair the outcome always favours the powerful
in such a situation the ruling parties do not lose elections
usually losing party does not accept the outcome of a rigged election
the outcome of india’s election speaks for itself  the ruling parties routinely lose elections in india both at the national and state level
 in the us an incumbent or sitting elected representative rarely loses an election
but in india about half of the sitting mps or mlas lose elections
 candidates who are known to have spent a lot of money on buying votes and those with known criminal connection often lose elections
 except for some disputed elections the electoral outcomes are usually accepted by the defeated party as ‘people’s verdict’
challenges to free and fair elections the challenges to free and fair elections are listed as follows  candidates and parties with a lot of money may not be sure of their victory but they do enjoy an unfair advantage over smaller parties and independents
 some candidates with criminal records are able to secure party tickets from major parties due to their connections political
 some families tend to dominate political parties a tendency for the dynastic rule is very common
 elections offer only little choice to ordinary citizens
all the major parties are quite similar to each other both in policies and practice
this is a matter of concern for all who believe in democracy
summary the most common form of democracy in our times is for the people to govern through their representatives
 the mechanism by which people can choose their representatives at regular intervals is called election
 in elections the voters can choose who will form the government
each vote has an equal value
 as an alternative to elections all the people can sit together every day and take all the decisions but this is not possible in large communities
 the procedure of elections favours political competition among different political parties
 electoral competition creates a sense of disunity and factionalism in every locality
 different political parties and candidates often use a dirty trick like booth capturing allegations to win elections
 in india the general eisfefione for lok sabha and vidhan sabha is held regularly after every five years and elections are held rn all constituencies at the same time
 sometimes an election is held for one constituency to fill the vacancy caused by death or resigning of a member
this is known gs by-election
 in india an area based system of representation is followed where the country is divided into different areas for election purposes is called electoral constituencies
 for lok sabha election
india is divided into  constituencies
the representatives elected from each constituency are called members of parliament or mps
 for vidhan sabha each state is divided into the number of assembly constituencies
the elected representative from each assembly constituency is called members of legislative assembly or mla$
 each village or town is divided into several words and the same electoral procedure takes place for panchayat and municipal elections
 a special system of reserved constituencies for the weaker sections especially for the scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts is also followed in india
 reservation is also followed for seats in rural and urban local bodies for other backward classes obcs and women
 in democratic elections the list of people eligible to vote is prepared much before the election and is officially called the electoral roll or the voter’s list
which is updated from time to time
 incur country all the citizens aged  years and above have the right to vote regardless of his or her caste religion or gender
this is known as the universal adult franchise
 a new system of election photo identity card epic has been introduced
the voters are required to carry this card when they go out to vote so that io one can vote in the place of someone else
 political parties nominate their candidates who get the party support and symbol
party’s nomination is often called party ticket
the candidate has to fill a nomination form and give some money as a security deposit
 candidate getting the party ticket should be  or above and has to declare educational qualifications assets liabilities and criminal cases pending if any
 each political party has to agree to the model code of conduct
violation of the code can result in the rejection of the candidate
 on the day when the voters cast or poll their vote is called an election day and such voting is done through secret ballot
 voting is done through ballot papers and electronic voting machines evms
 counting is done on a fixed data arid the candidate securing the highest number of votes is declared a winner from that constituency
 in our country elections are conducted by an independent and very powerful body known as election commission
 the chief election commissioner
cec is appointed by the president of india and is not answerable to the president or the government
 the election commission takes decisions on each and every aspect of the elections
 people’s turnout in the elections indicate a free and fair election procedure
 the political parties have to accept the outcome of the elections in ah circumstances
they have to work with and within institutions
in this process they come across three institutions that play a key role in major decisions
these institutions are legislature executive and judiciary
process of taking a major policy decision a major policy decision is taken through a government order
to know the process of taking a major policy decision it is important to know about government order and its issuing
a government order issuing of government order a government order is a written direction on an issue signed by a government authority office
on th august  the government of india issued an order
it was called an office memorandum
it had a specific number
it was signed by the joint secretary who is an officer in the department of personal and training in the ministry of personal public grievances and pensions
decision announced by an order the order announced a major policy decision
according to the order % of the vacancies in civil posts and services of government were reserved for sebc socially and educationally backward classes
earlier benefit of job reservation was available to scheduled castes scs and scheduled tribes sts
now the third category sebc was also eligible for quota of %
controversy over the order the issuing order led to the country wide protest
some of the protests were violent- as a result the issue became the most debated in the media with different views and opinions
the people reacted strongly because this decision affected thousands of job opportunities
appeal to stop implementation of order some person and associations filed a number of cases in courts against the order
they appealed to declare the order invalid and stop its implementation
this case came to be known as the indira sawhney and others vs union of india case
supreme court’s declaration over the order by a majority the supreme court in  declared the order valid
it also asked the government to identify its original order
modifications in order and end of dispute the order was modified and declared that well-to-do persons of backward classes should be excluded from the benefit of reservation
on th september  another memorandum was issued by the department of personal training
since then the dispute ended and the same policy was followed
main events before the passing of government order the main events before the passing of government order for obc reservation were as follows  the government of india had appointed the second backward classes commission in 
it was neaded by bp mandal
hence it was popularly called the mandal commission
one of these was that % of government jobs be reserved for the socially and economically backward classes
for several years many parliamentarians and parties kept  then came the lok sabha election of 
in its election manifesto the janata dal promised that if voted to power it would implement the mandal commission report
 the janata dal did form the government after this election
 it’s leader vp singh became the prime minister and he implemented it
the decision makers the major decision involves some major functionaries in our country
these are  president he is the head of the state and is the highest formal authority in the country
 prime minister he is the head of the government and actually exercises all governmental powers
he takes most of the decisions in the cabinet meetings
 parliament it consists of the president and two houses—lok sabha and rajya sabha
the lok sabha or the lower house is composed of the elected representatives of the people
the rajya sabha or upper house represents the interests of the states and union territories
the prime minister must have the support of a majority of lok sabha members
in our country all the major decision are taken by the council of ministers in the cabinet meetings headed by the prime minister
after that the decisions are discussed in parliament lok sabha and rajya sabha and after the approval of parliament approval by the majority of members of lok sabha and rajya sabha it is sent to president for final approval
once the decision is approved by the president it is ready to be implemented and issued by the concerned government authority officer as government order
how to oppose government decisions if some people or associations are not satisfied by government orders and there is a dispute regarding government order then they can file the cases in the supreme court or in high court
for example some persons and associations filed a case in the supreme court against the government of india decision of % of reservation for socially and educationally backward classes in civil posts and services
this case was known as ‘indira sawhney and other vs union of india case’
need for political institutions the arrangements made in the democracies to take decisions implemented the decision to see what is wrong and what is right in case of disputes regarding the decision are sailed political institutions
so without the functions of the tasks assigned to the political institution the democracy cannot work
institutions involve rules and regulations which can bind the hands of the leaders
parliament parliament is a set of people elected regularly by the people of the country directly through direct elections or indirectly through indirect election
all the by the government before implementation are put in the parliament for discussion
decisions can be implemented only after the approval by the parliament
need of parliament we need parliament due to the following reasons
 parliament is the final authority for making new laws and changing existing laws in our country
 in india the control of parliament over the government is direct and full
those who run the government can take decisions only as long as they enjoy the support of the parliament  parliament controls all the money that the government has
in most countries public money can be spent only when parliament sanctions it
 parliament is the highest forum of discussion and debate on public issues and national policy in my country
parliament can seek information about any matter
two houses of parliament the parliament plays a central role in modern democracies
large countries have divided the role and powers of parliament into two parts
they are called chambers or houses
usually one house is directly elected by the people and exercises the real power on behalf of the people
the second house is usually elected indirectly its main work is to look after the interests of various states regions or federal units
indian parliament consists of two houses or chambers
lok sabha house of the people or lower chamber it is usually directly elected by the people and exercises the real power on behalf of the people
rajya sabha council of states or upper chamber it is indirectly elected and performs special functions such as interest of various states regions or federal units
the president of india is a part of the parliament of although she is not a member of either house
due to this reason all laws made in the houses come into force only after they receive the assent of the president
special powers of lok sabha over rajya sabha our constitution gives some special powers to rajya sabha but on most of the matters the lok sabha exercises supreme power
but if there is a difference between the two houses the final decision is taken in a joint session where the view of lok sabha is likely to prevail because of its larger number of members
lok sabha exercises more powers in money matters
once the lok- sabha passes the budget of the government or any other money-related law or money bill foe rajya sabha cannot reject it
the rajya sabha can only delay it by  days or suggest to change it
but foe lok sabha may or may not accept these changes
most importantly foe lok sabha controls foe council of ministers
only a person who enjoys the support of foe majority of foe members in foe lok sabha is appointed foe prime minister
if the majority of foe loksabha members say that they have ‘no confidence’ in foe council of ministers all ministers including foe prime minister have to quit
but foe rajya sabha does not have this power
they are called executive because they are in charge of the execution of the policies of the government
by executive we usually mean the government
political and permanent executive in a democratic country two categories make up the executive
they are political executive and permanent executive
political executive they are elected by the people for a specific period
political leaders fall in these categories
permanent executive they are appointed on a long-term basis
they are also known as civil servants
they remain in office even when the ruling party changes
they work under the political executive and assist them for carrying out daily administration
powers of permanent and political executive the political executive has more power than the permanent executive
this is because the political executive is elected by the people and in a democracy will of people is supreme
the political executive exercise the will of the people on their behalf
they are answerable to the people for all consequences of their decisions
permanent executive are more educated and-have expertise on the subject of ministry
for instance advisor of the finance ministry know more about economics than the finance minister
but still decision of the finance minister will be the final
political executive call take advice of the permanent executive arid then decide the overall framework and objectives of the policy to be implemented
he is the most important political institution in the country
appointment of prime minister there is no direct election to the post of the prime minister
the president appoints the leader of the majority party or the coalition of parties that commands a majority in the lok sabha as a prime minister
in case no single party gets a majority the president appoints the person most likely to secure majority support
collective responsibility for any decision or action of the cabinet the council of ministers is collectively responsible
if any of the cabinet decisions is not approved by the parliament the entire council of ministers has to resign
tenure of prime minister the prime minister does not have a fixed tenure
he continues in power as long as he remains the leader of the majority or coalition party
powers of the prime minister the prime minister has wide-ranging powers
these are  on the advice of the prime minister the president appoints other ministers
 the prime minister is free to choose ministers as long as they are members of parliament
 he chairs and takes most of the decisions in the cabinet meetings
 he coordinates the work of different departments and his decisions are final in case disagreements arise between departments
 he exercises general supervision of different ministries and all ministers work under his leadership
 he distributes and redistributes work to the ministers
 he also has the power to dismiss ministers
when prime minister quits the entire ministry quits
council of ministers it is the official name for the body that includes all the ministers
it usually has  to  ministers of different ranks
the council of ministers has collective responsibility
the council of ministers comprise cabinet ministers are usually top-level leaders of the ruling party or parties who are in charge of the major ministries
they meet to take decisions in the name of the council of ministers
the cabinet is the inner ring of the council of ministers
it comprises about  ministers
they participate in the cabinet meetings only when specially invited
ministers of state are attached to and required to assist cabinet ministers
appointment of council of ministers after the appointment of the prime minister the president appoints the council of minister on the advice of prime minister
they are usually from the party or coalition that has the majority in lok sabha
some times a person who is not a member of parliament can also become a minister
but such a person has to get elected to one of the houses of parliament within  months of his appointment
cabinet form of government since it is not practical for all ministers to meet regularly and discuss everything the decisions are taken in cabinet meetings
that is why parliamentary democracy in most countries is often known as the cabinet form of government
the secretaries provide the necessary background information to the ministers to take decisions
the cabinet as a team is assisted by the cabinet secretariat
this includes many senior civil servants who try to coordinate the working of different ministries
the president the president is the head of the state
in our political system the head of the state exercises only nominal powers
thus the president is like the queen of britain whose functions are to a large extent ceremonial
the president supervises the overall functioning of all the political institutions in the country so that they operate in harmony to achieve the objectives of the state
appointment of the president the president of india is elected indirectly by an electoral college in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote
the electoral college consists of  the elected members of both houses of parliament mps
 the elected members of the legislative assemblies of the states mlas  the elected members of the legislative assemblies mlas of union territories of delhi and puducherry
a candidate standing for president’s post has to get a majority of votes to win the election
this ensures that the president can be seen to represent the entire nation
the president can never claim the kind of direct popular mandate that the prime minister can
this ensures that he remains only a nominal executive
the presidential system presidents all over the world are not always nominal executives like the president of india
the us president is directly elected by the people
he personally chooses and appoints all ministers
most importantly the us president does not need the support of the majority of members in the congress and neither is
the president has a fixed tenure of  years and completes it even if his party does not have a majority in congress
this model is followed in most of the countries of latin america and many of the ex-soviet union countries
given the centrality of the president this system of government is called the presidential form of government
powers of the president the president enjoys the following powers all governmental activities take place in the name of the president
all laws and major policy decisions of die government are issued in her name
all major appointments are made in the name of the president
these include the appointment of the chief justice of india the judges of the supreme court and the high courts of the states the governors of the states the election commissioners ambassadors to other countries etc
electoral college a specially constituted elected body’to elect the president and vice-president of india
all international treaties and agreements are made in the name of the president
the president is the supreme commander of the defence forces of india
the president has emergency powers i
powers to deal with an unexpected and critical situation e
power to declare emergency or president’s rule and issuing an ordinance
power to appoint prime minister president appoints prime minister
the leader of the party or coalition of parties who secures a clear majority in the lok sabha elections is appointed as prime minister
when no party or coalition gets a majority in the lok sabha the president exercises her discretion and*appoints a leader who in her opinion can muster majority support in the lok sabha
limitation on the power of the president inspite of these powers there is a limitation on the powers of the president
he can exercise all these powers only on the advice of the council of ministers
the president can ask the council of ministers to reconsider its advice
but if the same advice is given again the president is bound to act according to it
similarly a bill passed by the parliament becomes a law only after the president gives assent to it
if the president wants she can delay this for some time and send the bill back to the parliament for reconsideration
but if the parliament passes the bill again the president has to sign it
the judiciary judiciary refers to an institution empowered to administer justice and provide a mechanism for the resolution of legal disputes
all the courts at different levels in a country put together are called the judiciary
the indian judiciary consists of a supreme court for the entire nation high courts and subordinate courts in the states district courts and the courts at the local level and lok adalats
india has an integrated or unified judiciary
its decisions are binding on all other courts of the country
independence of judiciary it means that judiciary is not under the control of the legislature or the executive
the judges do not act on the direction of the government or according to the wishes of the political party in power
that’s why all modem democracies including india have courts that are independent of the legislature and the executive
appointment of judges of supreme court and high courts the judges of the supreme court and the high courts are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister and in consultation with the chief justice of the supreme court
the senior judges of the supreme court select the new judges of the supreme court and the high courts
there is very little scope of interference by the political executive
the senior most judge of the supreme court is usually appointed the chief justice
removal of a judge of supreme court and high court once a person is appointed as judge of the supreme court or the high court it is nearly impossible to remove him or her from that position
it is as difficult as removing the president of india
a judge can be removed only by an impeachment motion passed separately by two-thirds members of the two houses of the parliament
it has never happened in the history of indian democracy
powers of the supreme court the supreme court can take up any dispute  between citizens of the country  between citizens and government  between two or more state governments  between governments at the union and state level role of the supreme court and the high courts the supreme court and the high courts have the power to interpret the constitution of the country
they can declare invalid any law of the legislature or the actions of the executive whether at the union level or state level if they find such law or action is against the constitution
they can determine the constitutional validity of any legislation or action of the executive in the country when it is challenged before them
this is known as the judicial review
the supreme court of india was also ruled that the core or basic principles of the
the constitution cannot be changed by parliament
judiciary as the highest authority the powers and the independence of the indian judiciary allow it to act as the guardian of the fundamental rights
anyone can approach the courts if the public interest is hurt by the actions of the government
this is called public interest litigation pil
they check malpractices on the part of public officials
that is why the judiciary enjoys a high level of confidence among the people
summary there are two categories of executive i
permanent executive and political executive
the political executive is more powerful than the permanent executive
the prime minister is the head of the government and actually exercises all the government powers
the leader of the majority party or coalition is appointed the prime minister by the president
the prime minister does not have a fixed tenure
he continues in power until he has majority
the prime minister has wide-ranging powers
he advises the president to appoint the other ministers
the council of ministers is the official name for the body that includes cabinet ministers ministers of state with independent charge and ministers of state
the president is the head of the state and exercises only nominal powers
the president is indirectly elected by an electoral college in accordance with the system of proportional representation
all the courts at different levels in a country put together is called integrated judiciary
the powers and the independence of the judiciary allow it to act as the guardian of the fundamental rights
through public interest litigation pil anyone can approach the courts if public interest is hurt by the actions of
in a democracy the rulers have to work with and within institution and in this process they ccme across three institutions  legislature executive and judiciary that play a key role in major decisions
a major policy decision is taken through a government order
an order issued by government is called an office memorandum om
the major decision involves some major functionaries of our country
they include the president the prime minister and parliament
parliament is a set of people who are regularly elected by the people directly or indirectly
the importance of parliament lies in the fact that it is the final authority for making new laws and changing existing laws in our country
the parliament of india consists of two houses i
the upper house and the lower house
the upper house or rajya sabha is indirectly elected and performs special functions
the constitution of india gives some special powers to rajya sabha but the lok sabha exercises supreme power on most matters
executives take the day-to-day decision but do not exercise supreme power on behalf of the people
the claims should be such that they can be made available to others in an equal measure
thus a right comes with an obligation to respect other’s rights
when the socially recognised claims rights are written into law in a democracy they are called democratic rights
life without rights the importance of rights can be judged by the one whose life has absence of rights
the following three examples state what it means to live in the absence of rights
prison in guantanamo bay about  people were secretly picked up by the us forces from all over the world and put in a prison in guantanamo bay near cuba
according to the american government they were enemies of the us and linked to the attack on new york on th september 
as a result there was no trial before any magistrate in the us nor could these prisoners approach courts in their own country
despite the provisions of international treaties prisoners were being denied the treatment
many prisoners tried to protest by going on a hunger strike they were not released even after they were declared not guilty
citizens’ rights in saudi arabia many countries like saudi arabia yugoslavia denied citizens’ rights
the position of citizens in saudi arabia can be understood by the following facts  the country is ruled over by a hereditary king and the people have no role in electing or changing their rulers
 the king selects the legislature as well as the executive
he appoints the judges and can change any of their decisions
media cannot report anything that the monarch does not like
 there is no freedom of religion
every citizen is required to be muslim
non-muslim residents can follow their religion in private but not in public
the testimony of one man is considered equal to that of two women
note there are many countries in the world where conditions like saudi arabia exist
ethnic massacre in kosovo in yugoslavia serbs were in majority and albanians were in minority
a democratically elected serb leader slobodan milosevic wanted to dominate the country
serbs thought that the albanians the ethnic minority group should leave the country or accept the dominance of serbs
a brutal massacre took place in kosovo in which thousands of albanians were killed
finally several other countries intervened to stop the massacre
milosevic lost power and was tried by the international court of justice for crimes against humanity
as a result kosovo with the majority population of albanians declared independence in february 
rights in a democracy in the discussed examples the victims are the prisoners in guantanamo bay women in saudi arabia and albanians in kosovo
so in these positions everyone would desire a system where security dignity and fair play are assured
everyone wants a system where at least a minimum assurance is guaranteed to all whether heshe powerful or weak rich or poor majority or minority
no one should be arrested without proper reason and information
if it happens then heshe should have a fair chance to defend themselves
this assurance should not only be on paper
there should be someone to enforce them and to punish those who violate them
this is real spirit behind the rights
meaning of rights rights ate reasonable claims of persons recognised in society and sanctioned by law
when fellow citizens or the government do not respect their rights we call it violation of our rights
in such situations citizen can approach courts to protect their rights
need of rights rights are necessary for the very sustenance of a democracy
in a democracy every citizen has to have the right to vote and the right to be elected to government
rights protect minorities from the oppression of majority
they ensure that majority cannot do whatever it wishes to do
rights are like guarantees which can be used when things go wrong
specially when some citizens may wish to take away the rights of others
in most democracies the basic rights of the citizen are written down in the constitution
‘ethnic minority group an ethnic minority group is a human population whose members usually identify each other on the basis of a common ancestry
people of an ethnic group are united by cultural practices religious beliefs and
rights in the india constitution some rights which are fundamental to our life are given a special status in indian constitution
they are called fundamental rights
these rights are guaranted by the constitution
they promise to secure for all its citizens equality liberty and justice
hence they are an important basic feature of india’s constitution
the six fundamental rights recognised by the constitution are 
right to freedom of religion 
cultural and educational rights 
right to constitutional remedies 
right to equality the constitution says that the government shall not deny the equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws to any person in india it means that the laws apply in the same manner to all regardless of a person’s status
this is called the rule of law
right to equality is the foundation of any democracy
it means that no person is above the law
the government shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion race caste sex or place of birth
every citizen shall have access to public places like shops restaurants hotels and cinema halls
similarly there shall be no restrictions with regard to the use of wells tanks bathing ghats roads playgrounds and places of public resorts maintained by government or dedicated to the use of general public
reservations the government of india has provided reservation for scheduled castes scs scheduled tribes sts and other backward classes obcs
but these reservations are not against the right to equality
equality does not mean giving everyone the same treatment no matter what they need
rather it means giving everyone an equal opportunity to achieve whatever one is capable of
sometimes it is necessary to give special
treatment to someone in order to ensure equal opportunity
thus the reservations of this kind are not a violation of the right to equality
untouchability the principle of non-discrimination extends to social life as well
the constitution directs the government to put an end to the practice of untouchability
it is the extreme form of social discrimination
untouchability does not mean refusal to touch people belonging to certain castes
rather it refers to any belief or social practice which looks down upon people account of their birth with certain caste labels
such practice denies their interaction with others or access to public places as equal citizens
that’s why the constitution made untouchability a punishable offence
sainath wrote a series of news reports in ‘the hindu’ newspaper describing untouchability and caste- discrimination that was still being practised against dalits or persons belonging to scheduled castes
sainath travelled to various parts of the country and found that in many places tea stalls kept two kinds of cups one for dalits one for others
 barbers refused to serve dalit clients
 dalit students were made to sit separately in the classroom and drink water from the separate pitcher
 dalit grooms were not allowed to ride a horse in the wedding procession
 dalits were not allowed to use common handpump or if they did the handpump was washed to purify it
right to freedom freedom means the absence of constraint restrictions
in practical life it means the absence of interference in our affairs by others—be it other individuals or the government
under the indian constitution all citizens have the right to  freedom of speech and expression  assembly in a peaceful manner  form associations unions and cooperative societies  move freely throughout the country  reside in any part of the country  practice any profession or to carry on any occupation trade or business
one cannot exercise his freedom in such a manner that violates others’ right to freedom
a person is free to do everything which injures or harms no one else
freedom is not an unlimited license to do what one wants
the government can impose certain reasonable restrictions on our freedom in the larger interests of society
freedom of speech and expression it is one of the essential features of any democracy
even if a hundred people think in one way you should have the freedom to think differently and express your views as you wish
you may express your views through pamphlets magazines newspapers paintings poetry or songs
however you cannot use this freedom to stimulate violence against others and excite people to rebel against the government
neither can we use it to defame others by saying false and mean things that cause damage to a person’s reputation assembly in a peaceful mannerform associations citizens have the freedom to hold meetings processions rallies and demonstrations on any issue
citizens also can form associations to promote their interests
freedom to travelchoice of occupations the citizen have the freedom to travel to any part of the country and are free to reside or settle in any part of the territory of india
this right allows lakhs of people to migrate from villages to towns an<f from poorer regions of the country to prosperous regions and big cities
the same freedom extends to choice of occupations
no one can force you to do or not do a certain job especially women
even people from deprived caste cannot be forced to keep their traditional occupations
personal liberty the constitution says that no person can be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law
it means that no person can be killed unless the court has ordered a death sentence
it also means that a government or police officer cannot arrest or detain any citizen unless he has proper legal justification
even when police arrests someone they have to follow some procedures like
 a person who is arrested and detained in custody will have to be informed of the reasons for such arrest and detention
 such as person shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within a period of  hours of arrest
 such a person has the right to consult a lawyer or engage a lawyer for his own defence
right against exploitation once the right to liberty and equality is granted it follows that every citizen has a right not to be exploited
still the constitution makers thought it is necessary to write down certain clear provisions to prevent exploitation of the weaker sections of the society
the constitution mentions three specific evils and declares these illegal
first the constitution prohibits ‘traffic’ in human beings
traffic here means selling and buying of human beings usually women or children for immoral purposes
second our constitution also prohibits forced labour or begar in any form
begar is a practice where the worker is forced to render service to the master free of charge or at a nominal remuneration
when this practice takes place on a life long basis it is called the practice of bonded labour
finally the constitution prohibits child labour
no one can employ a child below the age of  to work in any factory or mine or any other hazardous work such as railways and ports
using child labour as a basis many laws have been made to prohibit children from working in industries such as beed making fire crackers and matches printing and dyeing etc
right to freedom of religion every person has a right to profess practice and propagate the religion he or she believes in
every religious group or sect is free to manage its religious affairs
freedom to propagate one’s religion does not mean that a person has right to compel another person to convert into his religion by means of force fraud inducement or allurement
freedom to practice religion does not mean that a person can do whatever he wants in the name of religion
for example one cannot sacrifice animals or human beings as offerings to supernatural forces or sods
secularism it is based on the idea that the country is concerned only with relations among human beings
india is a secular state
a secular state is one that does not establish any one religion as official religion
in india no privilege or favour is provided to any particular religion
the government cannot compel any person to pay any tax for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious institution
there shall be no religious instruction in the government educational institutions
in educational institutions managed by private bodies no person can be compelled to take part in any religious instruction or to attend any religious worship
cultural and educational rights the working of democracy gives power to majority
thus it is the language culture and religion of minorities that need special protection
otherwise they may get neglected or undermined under the impact of the language religion and culture of the majority
the following cultural and educational rights for minorities are specified by our constitution  any section of citizens with a distinct language or culture have a right to conserve it
 admission to any educational institution maintained by the government or receiving- government aid cannot be denied to any citizen on the grounds of religion or language
 all minorities have the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice
right to constitutional remedies the fundamental rights in the constitution are important because they are enforceable
we have a right to seek the enforcement of these mentioned rights
this is called the right to constitutional remedies
this right makes other rights effective
when any of the fundamental rights are violated then citizens can directly approach the supreme court or the high court
both courts have the power to writs habeas corpus manclamus prohibition quo warranto and certiorari for the
that’s why dr ambedkar called the right to constitutional remedies the heart and soul of our constitution
right to property the constitution originally provided for the right to property under articles  and 
but the th amendment act of  abolished this right from the list of fundamental rights
the amendment made it a legal right under article -a in the constitution
this right states that no person shall be deprived of his property
it came into force on st april 
the article -a says that state shall provide free and compulsory education to all children of the age of six to fourteen years
thus this provision makes elementary education a fundamental right
securing the fundamental rights there can be no law or action that violates the fundamental rights
if any act of the legislature or the executive takes away or limits any of the fundamental rights it will be invalid
citizens can challenge such laws in courts which enforce the fundamental rights against private individuals and bodies
any person can go to court against the violation of the fundamental right
if it is of social or public interest it is called public interest litigation pil
under the pil any citizen or group of citizens can approach the supreme court or a high court for the protection of public interest against a particular law or action of the government
national human rights commission nhrc it is an independent commission established in 
the commission is appointed by the president
the commission focuses on helping the victims to secure their human rights
these include all the rights granted to the citizens by the constitution
the commission also considers the human rights mentioned in the un sponsored international treaties that india has signed
the nhrc makes an independent and credible inquiry into any case of violation of human rights
the commission presents its findings and recomrpendations to the government
expanding scope of rights demands for many new fundamental rights have been coming up time to time
some of these demands have been included under the scope of fundamental rights
for example right to freedom of press right to education and right to information
according to the right to education every child has the right to get elementary education
according to right to information anybody can demand information regarding the functions of a government department or official
constitution provides many more rights which may not be fundamental rights
the-right to property right to vote in election are not fundamental rights but these are constitutional rights
human rights sometimes the expansion of rights takes place in human rights
human rights are universal moral claims that may or may not have been recognised by laws
with the expansion of democracy all over the world there is greater pressure on governments to accept these claims
some international covenants have contributed to the expansion of rights
thus the scope of rights has been expanding and new rights are evolving over time
new rights emerge as societies develop or as new constitutions are made
for example the constitution of south africa guarantees its citizens several kinds of new rights
these are  right to privacy so that citizens or their home cannot be searched their phones cannot be tapped their communication cannot be opened
 right to have access to adequate housing
 right to have access to health care services sufficient food and water no one may be refused emergency medical treatment
many people in our country think that the right to work right to health right to minimum livelihood and right to privacy should be made as fundamental rights in india
international covenant on economic social and cultural rights the international covenant recognises many rights that are not directly a part of the fundamental rights in the indian constitution
this has not yet become an international treaty
but human right activists all over the world see this as a standard of human rights
these include  right to work i
an opportunity to everyone to earn a livelihood by working
 right to safe and healthy working conditions fair wages that can provide a decent standard of living for the workers and their families
 right to an adequate standard of living including adequate food clothing and housing
 right to social security and insurance
 right to health i
medical care during illness special care for women during childbirth and prevention of epidemics
 right to education i
free and compulsory primary education equal access to higher education
claim demand for legal or moral entitlements a person makes on fellow citizens society or the government
covenant promise made by individuals groups or countries to uphold a rule or principle
it is legally binding on the signatories to the agreement or the statement
fundamental rights and duties summary  rights are reasonable claims of persons recognised by society and sanctioned by law and rights are necessary for the very sustenance of democracy
 the importance of rights can easily be judged by the one whose life has an absence of rights e
the prisoners in guantanamo bay and the citizen’s rights in saudi arabia

a constitution consists of a set of rules and principles to govern the country
the indian constitution was drafted by the constituent assembly which was formed in december 
the constituent assembly consisted of  members in 
it was headed by dr
the constituent assembly completed the work in two years eleven months and eighteen days
the constitution of india was adopted on th november  and came into force on th january 
the main features of the indian constitution are federalism parliamentary form of government separation of powers fundamental rights an independent judiciary and secularism
six fundamental rights have been granted to the citizens of india
a secular state is that which does not officially promote any particular religion as the state religion
society is bound to a certain set of rules which makes it what it is and differentiates it from other kinds of society
in modern countries this consensus is usually available in written form
a written document in which we find such rules is known as a constitution
constitution lays certain ideals that form the basis of the kind of country that we as citizens aspire to live in
a constitution helps serve as a set of rules and principles that all persons in a country can agree upon as the basis of the way in which they want the country to be governed
this includes the type of government and also an agreement on certain ideals that they all believe the country should uphold
principles and ideals of a monarchy are quite different from those of a democracy
therefore soon after the transition in the governing system in nepal the government started the process of making a new constitution of nepal because the earlier one did not suit their new setup
the country of nepal needs to change all its constitutive rules in order to usher in a new democratic society for which people had struggled for a long period
the constitution defines the nature of a country’s political system
in a monarchy king is the supreme power whereas in a democracy people rule the country
the government is run by the representatives elected by people at large
the constitution also describes rules that guard against misuse of power by the leaders
in india such provisions have been made in the section of fundamental rights
in one of the fundamental rights to all persons and says that no citizen can be discriminated against on grounds of religion race caste gender and place of birth
the constitution ensures that a dominant group does not use its power against other less powerful people or groups
the constitution also contains rules that ensure that minorities are not excluded from anything that is normally available to the majority
thus the constitution prevents the tyranny or domination by the majority of a minority
the constitution helps to protect us against certain decisions that we might take that could have an adverse effect on the larger principles that the country believes in
after independence it was unanimously agreed that india should be a democratic state where everyone must avail equal opportunity
for this there was a need for constitution which could ensure a perfect democracy
a group of around three hundred people who became members of the constituent assembly in  and who met periodically for the next three years to write indian constitution
there were so many factors most of them quite contrary to each of them to be assimilated with clear cut explanations that made the task very difficult
however the constitution was finalised with a lot of unique features
federalism is the prime feature of our constitution which refers to the existence of more than one level of government in the country
in india there are governments at the state and the centre
panchayati raj is the third tier of the government
the constitution clearly defines the jurisdictions of powers of the government at state and that at center
parliamentary form of government is the other feature of indian constitution which provides that the different tiers of governments shall constitute of the representatives elected by the people
it also guarantees universal adult suffrage for all citizens
the legislature refers to our elected representatives whereas the executive refers to a smaller group of people who are responsible for implementing laws and running the government and the judiciary refers td the system of courts in the country for preventing the misuse of power by any branch of the state
the feature of fundamental rights is the ‘conscience’ of the indian constitution
these rights protect citizens against the arbitrary and absolute exercise of power by the state
the constitution thus guarantees the rights of individuals against the state as well as against other individuals
the fundamental rights in the indian constitution include 
right to freedom of religion 
cultural and educational rights 
secularism a key feature of the indian constitution defines that a secular state is one in which the state does not officially promote any one religion as the state religion
the constitution thus plays a crucial role in laying out the ideals that we would like all citizens of the country to adhere to including the representatives that we elect to rule us
constitution usually a written document which contains the rules of governing a sovereign state
consensus agreement of all the people on an issue
democracy a form of government in which people at large hold the ultimate power of governance
the representatives of people constitute the government and undertake the constitutional responsibilities in order to achieve the ideals of the constitution
fundamental rights the set of rights which ensures the life of dignity and honor to all who live in its jurisdiction
equality state of being equal in all respects
representative the person who is elected by people through a general election to represent a constituency in the government
secularism a system under which a state does not officially promote any one religion as a state religion
india is one of them
india adopted a policy to separate the power of religion and the power of the state
the separation of religion from the state is known as secularism
the state can intervene in religion in order to end an evil social practice which it believes discriminates and violates fundamental rights
the indian secularism is different from other democratic countries as the indian states can intervene in religious affairs
the term secularism refers to the separation between the power of religion and the power of the state
this is important for a country to function democratically
there are two chief reasons why the separation between religion and state is important
 the first is to prevent the domination of one religion over another
 the second is to protect the freedom of individuals to come out of their religion embrace another religion or have the freedom to interpret religious teachings differently
we can give an example of the practice of untouchability which allowed upper caste people to dominate lower caste people
indian secularism does protect an individual’s religious freedom by maintaining a separation from religion
the indian state is not ruled by a religious group
it also does not support any one religion
in india government spaces such as law courts police stations government schools and offices are not supposed to demonstrate or promote any one religion
indian secularism follows a strategy of non-interference
but at some time it also intervenes in religion
again we can give an example of the practice of untouchability
the indian constitution bans this practice
in this instance the state is intervening in religion in order to end a social practice that it believes discriminates and excludes and that violates the fundamental rights of lower caste people
the intervention of the state can also be in the form of support
indian secularism is different from that of other democratic countries such as the united states of america
there is a strict separation between religion and the state in american secularism but in indian secularism as mentioned above the state can intervene in religious affairs
in indian secularism though the state is not strictly separate from religion it does maintain a principled distance vis-a-vis religion
this means that any interference in religion by the state has to be based on the ideals laid out in the indian constitution
coercion forcing someone to do something
freedom to interpret it refers to the freedom that all persons shall have to understand things in their own way
the parliament is made up of elected representatives of different political parties and has a lot of power
the parliament consists of total of  representatives
they are called members of parliament
parliament has two houses lok sabha i
lower house and rajya sabha i
upper house headed by their presiding officers i
 speaker and chairman respectively
the vice-president is the chairman of rajya sabha
in the parliament some seats are reserved for sc st and women candidates
the money bill is presented only in lok sabha whereas an ordinary bill can be presented in any of the houses
the important functions of parliament include making laws and to control guide and inform the government
india got freedom after a long and tough struggle
in this struggle for freedom people from different backgrounds participated
the british government had created such a havoc that they never dared to criticise any of their decisions even if they did not agree with them
the freedom movement changed this situation
the nationalists began to openly criticise the british government and make demands
they demanded that there should be elected members in the legislature with a right to discuss the budget and ask questions
the government of india act  allowed for some elected representation
however all adults were not allowed to vote
also people could not participate in decision making under the british rule
but the nationalists wanted that all persons in independent india would be able to participate in making decisions
therefore when india got freedom the dreams and aspirations of the freedom struggle were made concrete in the constitution
the constitution of independent india laid down the principle of universal adult franchise
now all adult citizens of the country have the voting right
in a democratic form of government the individual or citizen is the most important person
now the question arises how does the individual give approval to the government one way of doing so is through elections
people would elect their representatives to the parliament then one group from among these elected representatives forms the government
it means people through their chosen representatives form the government and control it
the indian parliament came into existence in 
it is the representative of the people and enjoys immense powers
elections to the parliament are held in a similar manner as they are for the state legislature
the lok sabha is usually elected once every five years
the country is divided into several constituencies
each of these constituencies elects one person to the parliament
the candidates who contest elections usually belong to different political parties
once elected these candidates become members of parliament also known as mps
these mps together form the parliament
the parliament performs several functions
it selects the national government
the parliament in india consists of the president the rajya sabha and the lok sabha
after the lok sabha elections are declared the leader of the party with the majority of elected members is invited by the president to form a government
the other political parties form the opposition
the largest amongst these parties are known as the opposition party
in such a situation a group of parties comes together to form a government
such a government is known as a coalition government
the prime minister of india is the leader of the ruling party in the lok sabha
from the mps who belong to his party the prime minister selects ministers to work with him to implement decisions
the rajya sabha functions primarily as the representative of the states of india in the parliament
it plays an important role of reviewing and altering alterations are required the laws initiated by the lok sabha
the parliament keeps a check on the ministers and their work
mps have the right to question the ministers about the working of their departments
this is usually done during the question hour
the government gets valuable feedback and is kept on its toes by the questions by the mps
in all matters dealing with finances the parliament’s approval is crucial for the government
the parliament makes laws for the entire country
the parliament now has more and more people from diverse backgrounds
there has also been an increase in political participation from the dalit and backward castes and the minorities
it has also been suggested that there should be reservation of seats for women
however this issue is still debated
evm it stands for electronic voting machine
approval it refers to the formal consent through elected representatives that parliament has as well as the fact that it needs to continue to enjoy the people’s trust
representative the person who is elected by the people is known as the people’s representative
universal adult franchise all adult citizens of the country enjoy the right to vote
coalition when one party does not get a clear majority a group of political parties form a coalition and elect a leader who then forms a government known as a coalition government
parliament the parliament in india consists of the president the rajya sabha and the lok sabha
it is the highest law-making body in the country
it is also known as sansad
rajya sabha it is also known as the council of states
its total membership is 
it is chaired by the vice-president of india
lok sabha it is also known as the house of the people
its total membership is 
it is presided over by the speaker
the largest amongst these parties is known as the opposition party
ruling party the party that rules the country
unresolved it refers to the situations in which there are no easy solutions to problems
according to the constitution all are equal before law
the rule of law applies equally to all citizens and no one can be above the law
neither a government servant nor even the president of the country
any crime or violation of law is subject to specific punishment
in ancient times there were so many laws
the british government introduced the rule of law
in india citizens can express their unwillingness by holding meetings or writing in newspapers to accept repressive laws
when any law favors one group and disregards the other then it is called controversial law
this type of law leads to conflict
in india the court has the power to cancel or modify any type of controversial law framed by the parliament
all persons in independent india are equal before the law
it means that the law cannot discriminate between persons on the basis of their religion caste or gender
laws apply equally to all citizens of the country and no one not even the president of the country is above the law
any crime or violation of law has a specific punishment
even the punishment that two persons received for the same crime varied depending on their caste backgrounds with lower castes being more ruthlessly penalised
even the colonial government failed to establish the rule of law in india
the colonial law was arbitrary
the sedition act of  presents the best example of the arbitrariness of british law
under this act any person protesting or criticising the british government could be arrested without due trial
indian nationalists raised voice against the arbitrary use of authority by the british
they began fighting for greater equality and wanted to change the idea of law from a set of rules that they were forced to obey to law as including ideas of justice
by the end of the th century the indian legal profession also began emerging and demanded respect in colonial courts
indian judges began to play a greater role in making decisions
their efforts did not go in vain
the rule of law emerged during the colonial period
when the indian constitution came into existence laws for the country began to be made by our representatives
the indian parliament makes laws for the entire country
whenever people think that a new law is necessary they propose for it
the parliament then comes forward and does what is required
the issue of domestic violence was raised by the people
the role of citizens is crucial in helping parliament frame different concerns that people might have into laws
sometimes it so happens that laws passed by the parliament turn out to be unpopular
sometimes a law can be constitutionally valid and hence legal but it can continue to be unacceptable to people because they feel that the intention behind it is unfair and harmful
in such a situation people might civilize this law by holding meetings etc
when a large number of people begin to raise voice against a wrong law then the parliament has to change it
we can make it clear through an example
various municipal laws on the use of space within municiple limits often make hawking and street vending illegal
no one will dispute the necessity for some rules to keep the public space open for people’s convenience
at the same time one cannot deny that hawkers and vendors provide essential services
this is their means of livelihood
hence if the law favours one group and disregards the other it will be controversial and lead to conflict
in such a situation people can go to the court which has the power to modify or cancel laws if it finds that they do not adhere to the constitution
in a democratic country like india people have full right to protest unjust laws
rule of law it means that all laws apply equally to all citizens of the country and no one can be above the law
the british passed the sedition act in 
under this act any person protesting or criticising the british government could be arrested without a trial
hindu succession amendment act  according to this law sons daughters and their mothers can get an equal share of family property
domestic violence it refers to the injury or harm or threat of injury or harm caused by an adult male usually the husband against his wife injury may be caused by physically beating up the woman or by emotionally abusing her
abuse of the women usually includes verbal sexual and economic abuse
the judicial system plays an important role in the functioning of indian democracy
the important functions of the judicial system i
the judiciary are dispute resolution judicial review upholding the law and enforcing the fundamental rights
in india there are three different levels of court i
district court high court and the supreme court
the law declared by the supreme court is binding on all courts as it is the highest level court in the country
supreme court is headed by the chief justice and  other judges
they are appointed by the president of india
in india there are two branches of the legal system i
civil law and the criminal law
civil law deals with any harm or injury to the rights of an individual
criminal law deals with conducts or acts that the laws define an offense
public interest litigation so that a poor person can easily get access to justice
the rule of law is enforced through a judicial system which consists of the mechanism of courts
whenever a law is violated one can approach these courts
it plays a major role in a democratic country
it performs several functions  – the judiciary not only applies the law of the country it also settles disputes and punishes the guilty
these disputes may take place between citizens between citizens and the government between two state governments and between the centre and state government
 the judiciary has the power to modify or cancel laws if it finds that they violate the basic structure of the constitution
this is know as judicial review
 in case our fundamental rights are violated we can approach the supreme court or the high court
in this sense the courts play a very significant role in protecting our fundamental rights
we have an independent judiciary
it means that the courts are not under the government and do not act on their behalf
the courts play a central role in ensuring that there is no misuse of power by the legislature and executive
there are three different levels of courts in our country
at the district level we have subordinate district courts
at the state level we have several high courts
the high court is the highest judicial authority in a state
at the top is the supreme court
the supreme court of india is the highest judicial authority in our country
the decisions made by the supreme court is binding on all other courts in india
we have an integrated judicial system
it means that the decisions made by the higher courts are binding on the lower courts
different levels of courts are connected to each other through the appellate system which means that a person can appeal to a higher court if they are not satisfied with the judgement passed by the lower court
court cases are broadly divided into two categories  civil cases deals with matters like money property inheritance marriage disputes etc
 criminal cases deal with cases of theft cheating robbery physical injury and murder
in civil cases a petition has to be filed before the relevant court by the affected party only
the court gives the specific relief asked for
criminal cases usually begin with the lodging of an fir with the police who investigate the crime after which a case is filed in the court
if found guilty the accused can be sent to jail
in principle all citizens of india can approach the courts in the country and seek justice
but in reality courts are not easily accessible
for a vast majority of the poor in india it is very difficult to approach the courts
legal procedures involve a lot of money and paperwork takes up a lot of time
therefore poor people often avoid to go to the courts to get justice
the legal process was greatly simplified and even a letter or telegram addressed to the supreme court or the high court could be treated as a pil
judicial system it is a mechanism of courts that a citizen can approach when a law is violated
judicial review the judiciary has the power to modify or cancel particular laws passed by the parliament if it finds that they do not adhere to the constitution

the role of the police begins with the lodging of an fir in the police station

the people who lived in close association with forests are known as adivasi
around % of india’s population is adivasi
the religious practices and the languages of adivasis is totally different from the majority
due to deforestation activities for different purposes adivasis are forced to migrate to cities
the communities which are numerically small in relation to the rest of population are known as minorities
the constitution of india provides safeguards to protect minority communities
in india muslims are considered as one of the minority community
% according to  of total population
but according to  census the muslims constituted 
marginalisation is a complex phenomenon which requires a variety of strategies measures and safeguards to redress the situation to protect the diversity
marginalisation is experienced in every sphere of life
economic social cultural and political factors work together to make certain groups in society feel marginalised
the term adivasi means the original inhabitants
adivasis have always been in close connection with forests
they are also known as scheduled tribes
about % of india’s population is adivasi
there are over  different adivasi groups in india
adivasi dominated states are chhattisgarh jharkhand madhya pradesh orissa gujarat maharashtra rajasthan andhra pradesh west bengal and the north-eastern states
adivasis worship their ancestors village and nature spirits
they have always been influenced by different surrounding religious such as shakta buddhist vaishnav christianity etc
adivasis have their own languages santhali is one of them
adivasis are usually portrayed in colourful costumes and headgear
their dances are also unique
it is the general belief of the people that adivasis are exotic primitive and backward
but it is not so in reality
adivasis had deep knowledge of forests
history is witness that big empires heavily depended on adivasis for the crucial access to forest resources
but today they are considered marginalised communities
the pre-colonial adivasis were basically hunter-gatherers and nomads
some adivasis also cultivated in one place
slowly and steadily they began to migrate because of economic changes forest policies • etc
thus they lost their access to forests
the forest land that once belonged to adivasis were cleared for different purposes such as agriculture and industry
according to official figures more than % of persons displaced due to mines and mining projects are tribals
another recent data shows that % of the persons displaced from the states of andhra pradesh chhattisgarh orissa and jharkhand tribals
with the loss of access to forests adivasis lost their means of livelihood
as a result they migrated to cities in search of work
in the cities they lead a very miserable life
they have no access to education
the term minority refers to the communities that are numerically small in relation to the rest of the population
people belonging to majority group may suppress or overpower minority communities
this may lead to their marginalisation
hence it is necessary to protect their interest
our constitution provides safeguards to them
the muslim community is also socially marginalised
 % of india’s population
they have over the years been deprived of the benefits of socio-economic development
they have little access to education
they are deprived of basic amenities like water electricity
in public employment too they always lag behind to other communities
the government is very active to improve the condition of the muslim community
it set-up a high-level committee in  to examine the social economic and educational status of the muslim community in india
the report discusses in detail the marginalisation of this community
it suggests that on a range of social economic and educational indicators the situation of the muslim community is comparable to total of other marginalised communities like scheduled castes and scheduled tribes
muslim customs and practices such as wearing burqa and fez make them different from others
this often becomes an excuse to treat them unfairly
this social marginalisation of muslims has led to them migrating from places where they have lived
in our country there are several marginalised communities like dalits
it is quite essential to bring these communities in the mainstream so that they may avail access to rights development and other opportunities
marginalisation the term refers to the situation in which an individual or a group of individuals is deprived of certain privileges or treated as different from others
adivasi it literally means ‘original inhabitants’
hierarchy a graded system or arrangement of persons or things
these who find themselves avail the least power
mainstream people or communities that are considered to be at the centre of a society
displaced people who are forced to move from their homes for some reasons such as construction of dams etc
militarised an area where the presence of the armed forces is considerable
malnourished one who does not get adequate food
members of a particular community
in many cases the marginalised groups are derived from the fundamental rights
in this case they forced the government to enforce these laws
the marginalised groups also influenced the government to frame new laws
the abolition of untouchability is one of such examples
the constitution always tries to ensure social and cultural justice to the marginalised groups
the government has framed many schemes and policies for the marginalised groups and made efforts to promote them
reservation is one of them which plays an important role in providing social justice to dalits and adivasis
for the safeguards of dalits the government has framed sc and st prevention of atrocities act 
the  act also helps the adivasis to defend their right to occupy the land that traditionally belonged to them
adivasis dalits muslims and women come under marginal groups
these groups experience inequality and discrimination at every level in society
as this hurt them they want to come out of this
they often challenge existing inequalities
many of them look up to the constitution to address their concerns
the constitution provides fundamental rights which are available to all indians equally including the marginalised groups
but as the marginalised groups fail to enjoy equal rights they insist the government to enforce laws
the government as a result frame new laws in keeping with the spirit the fundamental rights
this means that no one can henceforth prevent dalits from educating themselves entering temples using public facilities etc
our constitution states that no citizen of india shall be discriminated against on the basis of religion race caste sex or place of birth
this has been used by dalits to seek equality where it has been denied to them
there are specific laws and policies for the marginalised groups in our country
the government sets up a committee or undertakes a survey and then makes an effort to promote such policies in order to give opportunities to specific groups
the government tries to promote social justice by providing for free or subsidized hostels for students of dalit and adivasi communities
the laws which reserve seats in education and government employment for dalits and adivasis are based on an important argument that in a society like ours where for centuries sections of the population have been denied opportunities to learn and to work in order to develop new skills or vocations a democratic government must assist these sections
governments across the country have their own list of scs or dalits sts and backward and most backward castes
the central government too has its list
students applying to educational institutions and those applying for posts in government are expected to furnish proof of their caste or tribe status in the form of caste and tribe certificates
if a particular dalit caste or a certain tribe is on the government list then a candidate from that caste or tribe can avail of the benefit of reservation
besides policies there are also specific laws to protect the rights of marginalised communities
the scheduled castes and the scheduled tribes prevention of atrocities act came into being in  to
protect dalits and adivasis from the domination of the powerful communities
dalit the term dalit means ‘broken’ or oppressed socially and economically
policy a well-planned course of action that provides direction for the future sets goals to be achieved or lays out guidelines to be followed and acted upon
ostracise to socially boycott an individual and his family
dispasses to give up ownership or authority
morally reprehensible an act that violates all norms of decency and dignity that society believes in
assertive an individual or a group that expresses themselves and their views strongly
manual scavenging it refers to the manual practice of removing human and animal waste or excreta with the help of brooms tin plates and baskets from dry latrines and carrying it on the head to disposal grounds
it should provide safe drinking water to the people and also take care of sanita
public facilities relate to people’s basic needs
any modem society requires these facilities
the right to life that the constitution guarantees is for all persons living in the country
it is the responsibility of the government to provide these facilities as private companies give these facilities at high rates
when the resources are less the alternative sources are to be searched for like in chennai
public facilities relate to our basic needs such as water health education etc
the government is expected to play a major role in providing public facilities to ail
water is the basic need of people
it is essential for life and for good health
safe drinking water can prevent several water-borne diseases such as diarrhea dysentery cholera etc
unfortunately india has the largest number of cases of these diseases
it means safe drinking water is not available to all
our constitution recognizes the right to water as being a part of the right to life under article 
it means that there should be universal access to water
but in reality it does not happen so
not only water but other public facilities such as healthcare electricity public transport schools and colleges also need to be provided for all
the chief feature of a public facility is that once it is provided its benefits can be shared by several people
for example if an area is supplied with electricity it means that the entire people of that area can use its benefit
one of the most important functions of the government is to ensure that public facilities are made available to everyone
the government gets money for public facilities from the taxes collected from the people
the government is empowered to collect these taxes and use them for such programmes
for example to supply water the government has to incur costs in pumping water carrying it over long distances laying down pipes for distribution treating the water for impurities and finally collecting and treating waste water
it meets these expenses partly from the various taxes that it collects and partly by charging a price for water
this price is set so that most people can afford a certain minimum amount of water for daily use
as mentioned above water is a public facility of great importance
but the tragedy is that it is not available to all
the poor are the worst sufferers because they don’t have money to purchase water from private companies
crisis of water becomes acute during the summer months in several cities of the country
the shortage in municipal water is increasingly being filled by an expansion of private companies who are selling water for profit
a shortage of municipal water is often taken as a sign of failure of the government
our constitution recognizes many of the public facilities as being a part of the right to life
now it is the government’s responsibility to see that these rights are protected so that everyone can lead a good life
public facilities they are associated with our basic needs such as water electricity public transport etc
universal access universal access is achieved when everyone has physical access to a good condition or can also afford it
sanitation provision of facilities for the safe disposal of human urine and feces
company a company is a form of business set up by people or by the government
in order to ensure the abolition of child labor the government has to regularly inspect the factories and punish those who violate the law
many of these laws have their basis in the fundamental rights guaranteed by the indian constitution
for instance right against exploitation  according to this right no one can be forced to work on low wages or under bondage  no child below the age of  years shall be employed in shops factories or mines
the epa environment protection act  came into force soon after the bhopal gas tragedy and is considered umbrella legislation as it filled many gaps in the existing laws
the environment protection act authorizes the central government to protect and improve environmental quality and control and reduce pollution from all sources
it prohibits or restricts the setting or operation of any industrial facility on environmental grounds
in  the government of india amended the child labour prevention act
minimum wages law deals with the wages of the workers ensuring that they are not underpaid and this is updated every year
there is also a law to protect the interest of the producers and consumers in the market
so laws are there to ensure the relationship between the worker consumer and producer
they are governed in an un-exploitative manner
markets tend to be exploitative of people
therefore the government makes certain laws to protect people from such exploitation
these laws try to check unfair practices in the markets
in order to make maximum profits might deny workers their rights and not pay them wages
in this regard there is a law on minimum wages which ensures that workers are paid fairly
the government is also keen to protect the interests of producers and consumers in the market
there are also laws for them
these laws ensure that the relations between the worker consumer and producer are governed in a manner that is not exploitative
well laws are there to protect various interests
but what is important in this regard is the implementation of these laws
unless these laws are enforced it will be difficult to protect the weak from the strong
through making enforcing and upholding these laws the government can control the activities of individuals or private companies in order to ensure social justice
in october  the government amended the child labour prevention act banning children under  years of age from working as domestic servants or as workers in dhabas restaurants etc
it made employing these children punishable offense
bhopal gas tragedy is the world’s worst industrial tragedy that took place in the year 
union carbide uc an american company had a factory in bhopal in which it produced pesticides
at midnight on  december  methyl-isocyanide mic a highly poisonous gas started leaking from this vc plant which took numerous lives
among those who survived many developed severe respiratory disorders eye problems etc
the disaster was not an accident
union cabinet had deliberately ignored the essential safety measures in order to cut costs
although uc stopped its operations it left behind tons of toxic chemicals which have seeped into the ground to contaminate water
 years later people are still fighting for justice for safe drinking water for healthcare facilities and jobs for the people poisoned by uc
now the question arises why union carbide set up its plant in india
here they can save costs and earn higher profits
lower working conditions including lower safety measures are used as ways of’ cutting costs
in the uc plant every safety device was malfunctioning
in india there is so much unemployment that there are many workers who are willing to work even in unsafe conditions in return for a wage
employers take advantage of this
the government must ensure that safety laws are implemented
it is also the duty of the government to ensure that the right to life guaranteed by the constitution is not violated
the bhopal disaster shows lacking on the government’s part
there were weak safety laws and these too were not enforced
government officials refused to recognize the plant as hazardous and allowed it to come up in a crowded locality
in this way the safety of the people was disregarded both by the government and by private companies
in the year the bhopal gas tragedy took place there were few laws protecting the environment in india
the environment was treated as a free entity and any industry could pollute the air and water without any restrictions
the bhopal disaster brought the issue of the environment to the forefront
the indian government introduced new laws on the environment
henceforth the polluter was to be held accountable for the damage done to the environment
• one of the prime responsibilities of the government is to make appropriate laws and to enforce them
laws that are weak and poorly enforced can cause a serious disaster
consumer one who buys goods for personal use
investment it refers to the money that is spent to purchase new machinery or buildings or training so as to be able to increase production in the times to come
hazardous condition that is full of dangers
it is the soul of indian democracy
equal right to vote in a democratic country like india adults irrespective of their religion caste education status or place of birth are given the right to vote under universal adult franchise
does equality exist  in reality a difference exists between rich and poor
 the caste system is also rigid
 dalits in india and minorities are denied the right to dignity and equality
equality in indian democracy  the indian constitution recognizes every person as equal
however it does not mean that inequality does not exist in india
 universal adult franchise gives political equality not social and economic equality
 dignity is the thinking or state of being worthy of esteem or respect
 the dignity of an individual is violated on the basis of their caste religion or gender
 the government has tried to implement equality first through laws and second through government programmes or schemes to help disadvantaged communities
 everyone is equal before the law
there is no discrimination on the basis of caste colour religion race gender everyone has access to all public places and untouchability has been abolished
issues of equality in other democracies in the usa also the civil rights movement of the ’s restored the dignity of afro-american based on colour
equality is the soul of indian democracy
it influences all aspects of its functioning
in a democratic country like india all adults irrespective of what religion they belong to how much education they have had what caste they are or whether they are rich or poor are given the right to vote which is called universal adult franchise
universal adult franchise gives political equality to the people but it does not ensure social and economic equality
kanta devi is a domestic worker
she has gone to vote
she is standing in the queue and is waiting for her turn like others
she is happy that she is equal to all of the others because of each of them lies one vote
it gives her a good feeling that even wealthy and influential persons are standing in the queue
but the world beyond it is something else
in this world there is no equality
when kanta has to face the bitter reality of this world she becomes sure that she is prey to social and economic inequality
she cannot compare herself with the members of her saheb’s family where she works as domestic help
the only guarantee of voting rights to all adult persons is not the solution of all the problems
there are many people like kanta in our country who have the right to vote but whose daily living and working conditions are far from equality
just take the example of the caste system which has been in existence in india for centuries
this deeply- rooted evil has created divisions among people
the lower caste people and dalits are the exploited lot
they have always been discriminated against
dalits belong to the unprivileged class
omprakash valmiki is a famous dalit writer who writes about his bitter experience for being a dalit in his autobiography jonathan
his headmaster tortured him greatly
he made him sweep the school and the playground
while other children in his class were studying he was sweeping
this was very much insulting for him
the ansaris were also exploited people
they were not given a flat by the landlady simply because they belonged to other religion
both omprakash valmiki and the ansaris are badly treated
the indian constitution recognises every person as equal
while earlier no law existed to protect people from discrimination now there are several that work to see that people are treated with dignity and as equals
every person is equal before the law
what this means is that every person from the president of the country to a domestic help like kanta has to obey the same laws
no person can be discriminated against on the basis of their religion race caste place of birth etc
thus there are several laws in india that protect every person’s right to be treated equally
the midday meal scheme is one of the various steps of the government in this direction
under the midday meal scheme all government elementary schools provide children with cooked food
this scheme has helped increase the enrolment and attendance of poor children in school
in spite of all these efforts to increase equality of opportunity there continue to be big differences in our country between schools that the rich attend and those that the poor attend
india is not the only country where there is inequality
there are many democratic countries around the world where the issue of equality continues to be the key issue around which communities struggle
in the united states of america the african-american were seriously discriminated against
they were considered to be social inferiors
in the late s there took place a movement known as the civil rights movement for equal rights for african-americans
rosa parks became the leader of this movement
the civil rights act of  prohibited discrimination on the basis of race religion or national origin
the struggle for the recognition of all persons as equal and for their dignity should be maintained so that we may be hopeful for a society of equals
here adult means those who are  and above
dignity thinking of oneself and other persons as worthy of respect
constitution a document that lays down the basic rules and regulations for people and the government in the country to follow
civil rights movement this movement took place in the usa in the s in which the african- americans demanded equal rights and an end to racial discrimination
there are certain factors which affect our health
healthcare in india  india has the largest number of medical colleges in the world and is among the largest producer of doctors
 india is the fourth largest producer of medicines in the world
 most doctors settle in urban areas while people in rural areas have to travel long distance for medical facilities
 about  lakh people die from tuberculosis every year while  million cases of malaria are reported every year
 in india a paradoxical situation exists as health care resources are uneven
private and public healthcare  healthcare is divided into two categories public health services and private health services
 public health services is a chain of health centres and hospitals run by the government
one important aspect of public health is that it is meant to provide quality healthcare services either free or at a low cost so that even the poor can seek treatment
it is available in both the rural and urban areas
 private health services are not owned or controlled by the government
people have to pay a lot of money for every service that they use
as the cost of these private services is high many people cannot afford them
 private services sometimes encourage practice which is unethical
barely % of the indian population can afford medicines that they require during an illness
 it is the responsibility of the government to provide quality healthcare services to all its citizens especially the poor and the disadvantaged
 in  kerala decentralized its health budget at panchayati level to ensure effective health planning
 the best example of healthcare comes from costa rica where the government provides for adequate healthcare to people
in a democratic country it is the expectation of the people that government work for their welfare through the provision of education health employment etc
health is a vital aspect because only healthy people can prove themselves resourceful
health means our ability to remain free of illness and injuries
in broader sense health means something more than this
apart from disease we need to think of other factors such as clean drinking water pollution-free surroundings etc
adequate food is also essential for keeping ourselves in good health
a life with stress will lead us to illness
hence we need to be without mental strain
thus good health includes both a sound mind and sound body
we need proper healthcare facilities to maintain good health
healthcare facilities include health centres hospitals laboratories for test ambulance services blood banks etc
we also need medicines and equipment that are essential for treating patients
india has no dearth of qualified doctors
there are a large number of clinics and hospitals too
perhaps therefore a large number of medical tourists come to our country for treatment at a reasonable cost
india is the fourth largest producer of medicines in the world and is also a large exporter of medicines
despite all this the health situation in our country is very poor
the reason is that the government fails to make necessary healthcare available to all
healthcare facilities can be divided into two categories—public health services and private health facilities
the public health service is a chain of health centres and hospitals run by the government
it is found in both the rural and urban areas
at the village level there are health centres where there is usually a nurse and a village health worker
they deal with common illnesses
at the district level is the district hospital that supervises all the health centres
big cities have many government hospitals
under the public health system quality health care services are provided either free or at a low cost so that even the poor can seek treatment
under this system the action is also taken to prevent the spread of diseases like tuberculosis malaria jaundice cholera diarrhoea chikungunya etc
a large number of doctors run their own private clinics
in the rural areas registered medical practitioners rmps are found whereas in the urban areas a large number of doctors can be seen
there are hospitals and nursing homes that are privately owned and not run by the government
unlike public health services in private hospitals patients have to pay a lot of money for their treatment
in our country private services are increasing but public senices are not
as the private senices are run for profit the cost of these services is rather high
poor people find it difficult to get treatment here
adequate healthcare is not available to all in the country
only % of the population can afford all the medicines that they require during illness
it has been found that % of people who are admitted to a hospital for some illness have to borrow money or sell some of their possessions to pay for the expenses
for the poor every illness is a curse
as they are undernourished and live in unhygienic conditions they frequently fall ill
the expenses on illness make their situation even worse
so far women’s health is associated it is easily ignored
many tribal areas have few health centres
thus we can say without a doubt that the health situation of most people in our country is not good
costa rica is a country in north america
it is considered to be one of the healthiest countries in the continent
the costa rican government curtailed the expenses on the army to spend it on health education and other basic needs of the people
it provides them with safe drinking water sanitation nutrition and housing
medical tourists the foreigners who come to our country for medical treatment at hospitals that change the reasonable cost
communicable diseases diseases that spread from one person to another through water food air etc
for example schools hospitals etc
opd it refers to the out patient department
this is where people are first brought in and treated in a hospital without being admitted to any special ward
rmps it refers to registered medical practitioners
they are found in rural areas
in states it is the mla member of legislature assembly who represents the people
the mlas enter the assembly and form the government
every mla is elected from one area
this area is known as his constituency
a political party whose mla’s win more than half the number of constituencies in the state get the majority
the political party is called the ruling party
all the other members are called opposition
 every state in india has a legislative assembly and duration of the legislative assembly is five years
 the head of the state is the governor while the head of the government consists of the council of ministers headed by the chief minister
 the leader of the ruling party who forms the government is the chief minister
 the legislative assembly is a place where leaders debate and discuss on important issues and make important bills
 in addition to the legislative assembly the press conference is also a mode of knowing what the government does for the people
 the government has the power to make new laws for the state regarding health and sanitation
 laws for the state are made by the state legislative assembly
 laws for the country are made by the union parliament
an mla is a member of the legislative assembly
he is elected by the people
in this way he represents people
every state in india has a legislative assembly
each state is divided into constituencies
a constituency is an area from which all the voters living there choose their representatives who then become members of the legislative assembly mlas
these mlas belong to different political parties
a political party whose mlas have won more than half the number of constituencies a state can be said to be in a majority
the political party that has a majority becomes the ruling party and all other members become the opposition
after the elections the mlas belonging to the ruling party elect their leader who becomes the chief minister
the chief minister then selects other people as ministers
the governor of the state appoints the chief minister and other ministers
the ministers have separate offices
the debate is generally held in the assembly to discuss current problems
during debate time mlas can express their opinions and ask questions related to the issue or give suggestions about what should be done by the government
the minister then replies to the questions and assures the assembly that adequate steps are being taken
the chief minister and other ministers together are responsible to run the government
the word ‘government’ refers to government departments and various ministers who head them
all the mlas who gather together in the legislative assembly are called the legislature
the legislature assembly is not the only place where opinions are expressed about the work of the government
after the discussion in the assembly a press conference is generally held by a particular minister who explains the steps taken by the government
media persons then report these discussions in several newspapers
the government can also decide to make new laws for the state regarding sanitation and health facilities
the various government departments then implement these laws
majority a political party whose mlas have won more than half the number of constituencies in a state can say to be in a majority
opposition party the elected representatives who are not the members of the ruling party belong to the opposition party
the representative together plays the role of questioning government decisions and actions
they also raise new issues for consideration in the assembly
ruling party the political party that has the majority is known as the ruling party
press conference a gathering of media persons who are invited to hear about and ask questions on a particular issue and are then expected to report on this to the larger public
most of the societies value men and women differently
the role women play and the work they do are usually valued less than the roles men play and the work they do
this clears the fact that men and women do not have the same status
gender justice is an important issue to be highlighted
samoan islands  the samoan islands are one of the large groups of small islands in the southern part of the pacific ocean
till the s children in this island did not go to school
when the babies started walking on own they were left under the care of their older brothers and sisters
children as old as five years looked after their younger siblings
 after attaining nine years of age boys joined the older boys for outdoor activities like fishing and planting coconuts
however girls continued looking after the younger ones
 when girls became teenagers i
  years of age they were allowed more freedom as they could then go for fishing and plantation activities or help their mothers in cooking etc
madhya pradesh  in madhya pradesh india boys and girls had a different outlook
the school for boys was open while the one for girls was closed
 men and women do equal work but it is not valued equally
 valuing housework is an important element which needs to be propagated in society
 if we look at the lives of domestic workers they are involved in activities like sweeping cleaning cooking washing clothes and dishes or looking after children
most of these are women
 a number of housework actually involves many different tasks
the work requires strenuous and physically demanding situation
women’s work and equality  equality is an important principle of our constitution which says that being male or female should not become a reason for discrimination
 while the constitution does not discriminate between male and female in reality discrimination still carries on
 government has introduced measures like anganwadis or child care centres to improve the status of women in society
 the government has also started creche facilities to help women to take up employment outside the home
we find distinctions between boys and girls in our societies
this begins at a very young age
boys are often taught to be tough and serious while girls are taught to be soft and mild
boys are given toys like cars and guns to play with while girls are seen playing with dolls
these toys become a way of telling children what they will have different futures when they become men and women
most societies value men and women differently
the roles women play and the work they do are usually valued less than the roles men play and the work they do
this clears the fact that men and women do not have the same status
but the reality is that it is always the woman who bears the main responsibility for housework and caregiving tasks like looking after the family
as she does not earn money by doing these tasks her work is not recognized
the term houseworks involves many different tasks which require heavy physical work
in both rural and urban areas women and girls carry heavy headloads of firewood
housework also involves washing clothes cleaning sweeping and cooking foods etc
all these works are very tough still women do them every day
they do not complain or show any anguish on their face
the work of women is time-consuming too
they do not have much time for leisure
many women nowadays work both inside and outside the home
this is often referred to as the double burden
women bear this double burden very skilfully and efficiently
equality is an important principle of our constitution which says that being male or female should not become a reason for discrimination
but what we see in reality is that inequality still exists between both the sexes
the government is therefore very much keen to take some positive measures to improve the situation
the government has set up anganwadis or child-care centres in several villages in the country
the government has also started creche facilities to help women to take up employment outside the home
caregiving looking after the family with great sincerity
in our society women’s work is easily devalued
double-burden there are several women who work both inside and outside the home
this is known as a double burden
identity it is a sense of awareness of who one is
for example a person can be a brother a pilot an engineer etc
physically demanding it refers to the household tasks which are very tough and demand great physical strength
time-consuming it refers to the various household tasks which take much time
strenuous very tough and difficult
by getting an education women have got opportunities to rise in every field
women’s movement has risen to challenge discrimination in all parts of the world
fewer opportunities and rigid expectation  a lot of people feel that women are fit only for certain kinds of jobs as a nurse
they are not fit for technical jobs
 in most families women are taught that after school they have to get married
laxmi lakra however broke this stereotype image when she became the first woman engine driver of the northern railways
 we live in a society full of pressures
if boys do not work hard and get a good salary they are bullied learning for change  going to school is an important part of life
 today it is difficult for us to imagine that school and learning could be seen as out of bounds or not appropriate for some children
 in the past very few people learnt reading and writing
most children learnt the work their families or elders did
even in families where skills like pottery weaving and craft were taught the contribution of daughters and women was seen as secondary
 in the nineteenth century new ideas about learning and education appeared
but there was a lot of opposition to educating girls ever then
 in the s ramabai championed the cause of women’s education
 rashsundari devi of bengal was the first indian woman to write an autobiography called ‘amar jiban’
schooling and education today today both boys and girls attend school in large numbers
the difference in their education still remains  today education is the right of both boys and girls despite that only  % of the girls receive an education
 india has a census every  years which counts the population of the country
this information is used to measure things like literacy sex-ratio etc
 a huge number of sc and st children leave school at an early age
the  census even shows that muslim girls are less likely than dalit girls to complete primary school
 many reasons like non-availability of teachers and schools lack of transport cost of education indifferent attitude of teachers and parents are responsible for the negligence of education
women’s movement  women have individually and collectively struggled to bring about changes
this is called the women’s movement
 different strategies have been used to spread awareness fight discrimination and seek justice
 these movements are related to campaigning raising awareness protesting and showing solidarity
 men and women in society are looked upon as playing specific gender roles
women have been facing inequalities at every step since time immemorial
no doubt their position and status have been improved with the change of time still they lag behind men in almost every field
it has also been seen that some occupations are considered to be more suitable for men than for women
it means women are good at only certain jobs
many people believe that women make better nurses because they are more patient and gentle
it is also believed that women do not bear technical mind and therefore they are not capable of dealing with technical things
thus they have been stereotyped as good nurses good teachers etc
they are never seen as army officers pilots railway engine drivers etc
a majority of indians believe in these stereotypes
it is therefore girls do not get the same support that boys do to study and train to become doctors and engineers
today’s women have become very aware
they are determined to break these stereotypes by excelling them in fields which were considered male preserves till now
we have now women pilots engineers police officers scientists etc
we can mention here the name of laxmi lakra who by becoming an engine driver showed the world that women can do everything
children especially boys are under great pressure
they are pressurised to think about getting a job that will pay a good salary
it is a matter of great anxiety for the parents if their son shows his inclination towards studying subjects other than science or maths
in our present social set-up parents have developed a false belief that only science and maths are meaningful subjects
only these subjects can make their son’s future secured
these notions have no base
subjects like history political science etc
one positive change that is visible today is that more and more children have started going to school
in the past the skill of reading and writing was known to only a few
most children learnt the work their families or elders did
but girls faced the even worse situation
in communities that taught sons to read and write daughters were not allowed to learn the alphabet
slowly and steadily there came more and more positive changes
the communities that never learnt reading and writing started sending their children to school
in the beginning there was a lot of opposition jp educating girls
but there were also women and men who made efforts to open schools for girls
women struggled to learn to read and write
here the experience of rashsundari devi - is worth mentioning
she was a housewife from a rich landlord’s family
at that time it was believed that if a woman learnt to read and write she would become a widow
despite this she taught herself how to read and write in secret after her marriage
she wrote her autobiography in bangla which titled amar jaban rokeya sakhawat hossain was another example who did a lot for women’s education
she knew how to read and write urdu but she was stopped from learning bangla and english
in those days only boys were taught english
however she learnt to read and write bangla and english
afterwards she became a writer and wrote a remarkable story titled sultana’s dream in 
she did a lot to help other girls go to school and to build their own dreams
in  she started a school for girls in kolkata which is still functioning well
no doubt more and more girls have started attending school still they lag behind boys
only % of girls and women are literate in india
thus the percentage of the male group is higher than the female group
girls who are from dalit and adivasi backgrounds are less likely to remain in school
one of the many reasons is that several families are too poor and unable to bear the cost of educating all their children
boys easily get preference in such circumstances
the position and status of women have undoubtedly improved a lot which is due to the collective efforts of the women of the country
women’s movement also gets the support of men
they used different strategies to spread awareness fight discrimination and seek justice
they also protest when violations against women take place
women’s movement also shows solidarity with other women and causes
stereotype the fixed image of a person and a community
stereotypes prevent us from looking at people as unique individuals
violation when someone forcefully breaks the law or a rule or openly shows disrespect we often say that heshe has committed a violation
sexual harassment physical or verbal behaviour that is of a sexual nature and against a woman’s wishes
protest to raise voice against the wrong action or decision
scheduled caste sc it is the official term used for dalit class of people
autobiography autobiography is the life sketch of the writer himself
manuscript the script written in the writer’s own handwriting
census census is held every  years
it counts the whole population of the country
it also gathers information about the people living in india— their age schooling what work they do and so on
tv radio and newspapers are forms of media
since they reach millions of people across the world they are called mass media
media is the plural form of the word ‘medium’ and it describes the various ways through which we communicate in society
media and technology  life without media is difficult
cable tv and the internet are recent phenomena
 both print media and electronic media have played an important role in social change
 changing technology or machines help media to reach more people
 television has enabled us to think of ourselves as members of the global people
 it is the responsibility of the media to present a fair and balanced report
 media is far from being independent
this is because of the control of the government over media called censoring and because big business houses control the media
 an independent media means that no one should control and influence its coverage and news
media and money  the different technologies that mass media use are expensive
 in a news studio it is not only the newsreader who needs to be paid but also a number of other people who help put the broadcast together
to meet this cost it needs money
 media thus has come to be owned by big corporate
 media therefore uses advertising as a tool to raise revenue
media and democracy  media plays a very important role in providing news and discussing events taking place in the country and the world
 new stories of media inform people about important events in the country
setting agendas  the media also plays an important role in deciding which stories to focus on
 by focusing on particular issues it influences and shapes our thoughts
it is said the media sets the agenda for people
 very recently the media reported alarming levels of pesticides in cold drinks
this report led to safety standards being set for colas
 media plays a very important role in our lives as it tells us about working of the government
 freedom of expression should be given to media to report events independently
media is the plural form of the word ‘medium’
it describes the various ways through which we communicate in society
media refers to all means of communication everything ranging from a phone call to the evening news on television
television radio and newspapers are called mass media because they reach millions of people at the same time
the technology that mass media uses keeps changing
newspapers and magazines come under print media while television and radio come under electronic media
changing technology or machines and making technology more modern helps media to reach more and more people
it also improves the quality of sound and the images
it also changes the ways in which we think about our lives
television plays a major role in our life
we cannot think of life without tv
it gives us news and entertainment and many other things
mass media uses expensive technologies
a tv studio needs lights cameras sound recorders transmission satellites etc
all these cost a huge amount of money
mass media also spends a lot of money on getting the latest technology
most television channels and newspapers become a part of big business houses in order to fulfill their requirement of money
mass media earns money by advertising different things such as surf chocolates etc
media plays a significant role in democracy
it provides news and discusses events that take place in the country and the world
it is on the basis of this information we come to know how the government works
a balanced report is one that discusses all points of view of a particular story and then leaves it to the readers to make up their minds
independent media can write a balanced report
hence it is necessary for the media to be independence
but the reality is that media is far from independent
there are two reasons behind it
the first is the control that the government has on the media
where the government prevents either a news item or scenes from a movie or a lyric of a song from being shared with the larger public this is known as censorship
during the emergency period - the government censored the media
while the government does continue to censor films it does not really censor the media’s coverage of news
despite the absence of censorship by the government most newspapers do not provide a balanced report
it has been found out by the persons who research media that business houses control media
it means that the media is not independent
it means media has to decide what stories to focus on and therefore decides on what is newsworthy
media should focus on issues that are significant in our lives
but very often it fails to do so
cricket fashion shows are very popular with the media
local media deals with small issues that involve ordinary people and their daily lives
it is written in the local language bundeli
media the word ‘media’ refers to all means of communication everything ranging from a phone call to the news on television
 it is known as a public protest
balanced report a balanced report is one that discusses all points of view of a particular story and then leaves it to the leaders to make up their minds
censorship the government has the power to disallow media from publishing or showing certain stories
this means that the government can censor the media
broadcast a tv or radio programme that is widely transmitted
setting agenda one of the important functions of media is that it decides what stories should be focused on and thus decides on what is newsworthy
this is often said that the media sets the agenda
local media it deals with small issues that involve ordinary people and their daily lives
it publishes news of local importance
advertisements are found in several forms print and electronic media as well as in hoarding or on taxis
building brands and brand values  advertising is all about building brands
at a very basic level branding means stamping a product with a particular name of the sign
products have an associating brand value with which the consumer associates themselves
 for example there are many soaps but every company will have to give the soap a different name by doing this they create another brand of soap
 through advertisements the company uses visuals and images to create a brand value for their product such that the products may create an impression in the customer’s mind
brand values and social works  advertisements play an important role in social and cultural life
 branded products are costly but companies link them to style design etc
such that people tend to buy them
 advertisements appeal to personal emotion of people which induce people to buy the products
how does an advertisement get made  advertising plays an important role in making a brand name
 advertising is normally made by advertising agencies which help in devising a marketing strategy
 campaigning is done carefully by the companies to promote their products
advertising and democracy  advertising a product costs a lot of money
small manufacturers are not able to compete in the market
 it makes us believe that things that are packaged and have a brand name are far better than things that do not come in packets
 democracy is based on equality
sometimes advertisements confuse the customers and influence their thinking
as citizens of a democratic country people should understand that they can take a better decision about whether they wish to buy a product or not
all of us are very much familiar with advertisements or ads
it is because we see advertisements everywhere—on television on street walls in newspapers etc
advertisements draw our attention to various products and describe them positively in order to impress us
advertising is all about building brands
branding actually means stamping a product with a particular name or sign in order to differentiate it from other products in the market
only branding a product is not enough because there are many brands of the same product available in the market
this creates tough competition for the manufacturers
they have to convince us that their products are better than the others
and at this juncture advertising comes in
it plays a crucial role in trying to convince us to buy a product that is advertised
but when a similar product under different brand names is advertised it creates confusion for the consumers
they fail to decide which one they should buy
therefore they begin claiming certain special values for their brand
in this way they try to differentiate it from other similar product
these brand values are conveyed through the use of visuals and words to give us an overall image that appeals to us
advertisements have become a part of our social and cultural life
all of us watch advertisements with great attention
most of us discuss them and often judge people according to the brand products they use
advertisements influence our life to a great extent
branded products are costly because they include the costs of packaging and advertising
it is therefore many people cannot afford them
those who manage to buy them feel exalted but those who fail to buy feel depressed
we must be aware of the fact that there is little difference between things sold in packets and those sold loose
advertisements often target our personal emotions
by linking our personal emotions to products advertisements tend to influence the ways in which we value ourselves as persons
our cricket heroes and film stars advertise several products
we often feel tempted to buy these products
advertisements often show us images of the lifestyles of rich people and seldom show us the real-life situation
advertisements aim to get people to buy a particular brand
this means that often we see an advertisement we should want to buy the brand
advertising a product is a costly affair
it is therefore only large companies can advertise
small business cannot afford the cost of advertisement and therefore they sell their products in weekly markets and neighborhood shops
product a thing or a service that has been made for sale in the market
brand a special identification or name that is associated with a product
branding stamping a product with a particular name or sign
manufacturer one who is associated with the production of a thing or things
advertisement advertisement is a visual and verbal representation to provide a product among the masses
consumer the person for whom the goods or products have been made and who pays money to buy and use them
lifestyle the way of living
social advertisements these are made by the state or private agencies that have a larger message for society
it establishes a link between the producer and the consumer
there are different kinds of markets namely weekly market shops shopping complex or mall
the profit earned by different market varies
it depends on the type of investment made by seller and buying capacity of the customer
in present times goods are also sold by online marketing and home delivery
weekly market  a weekly market is so-called because it is held on a specific day of the week
 shops may be permanent or hawker type
they provide different goods and sometimes even on credit
 there are thousands of such markets in india
people come here for their everyday requirements
 traders set up shops for the day and then close them up in the evening
 many things are available in a weekly market at cheaper rates
 one advantage of weekly markets is that most of the things of need are available in one place
shops in the neighbourhood  there are many shops that sell goods and services in our neighborhood
 we may buy milk from the dairy grocery from the departmental stores etc
 these shops are useful as they are near our home and we can go there on any day of the week
shopping complexes  there are other markets in the urban area which have many shops at one place called a shopping complex
 in many urban areas we also have multi-storied air-conditioned buildings with shops on different floors as malls
 malls sell branded and non branded goods and invest a huge amount of money in their shops
chain of markets  the people in between the producer and the final consumer are traders
 the person who produces goods in the producer
the person who buys goods from him is the wholesaler
the wholesaler gives it to the traders who gives it to the consumer
 this trader is known as the retailer
 the retailer could be a trader in a weekly market a hawker neighborhood shop owner in the shopping complex etc
markets everywhere  all markets work in a space in a particular manner and time
 there are even markets we may not be aware of
this is because a large number of goods that we don’t use directly are also bought and sold
for example a car factory purchases engine parts gears petrol tanks axles wheels etc
we however do not get to know about either the manufacturers or the sellers involved in it
a market is a place where we go to buy many things such as rice toothpaste clothes notebooks bread etc
there are many kinds of markets—shops hawker’s stall in our neighborhood a weekly market shopping complex and mall
the weekly market is held on a specific day of the week
such markets do not have permanent shops
traders set up shops for the day and then close them up in the evening
things in weekly markets are available at cheaper rates
another feature of these markets is that most of the things that we need are available at one place
we also find shops in our neighborhoods
these shops sell things of daily use
we may buy milk from the dairy groceries from departmental stores stationery eatables or medicines from other shops
shops in the neighbourhood may be permanent and roadside stalls
neighborhood shops are very useful
as the buyer and seller know each other these shops also provide goods on credit
apart from these markets there are shopping complexes and malls too which are usually found in urban areas
these urban shops are large multi- storeyed air-conditioned buildings where one can get both branded and non-branded goods
branded goods are expensive and therefore a very small group of people can afford to buy them
these shops are usually not meant for the common people
however we don’t buy directly from the factory or from the farm
the producers are also not interested in selling us small quantities
the trader comes in between the consumer and the producer
the wholesale trader buys goods in huge quantities from the producer and then he sells these goods to the retailers
these retailers finally sell different articles to consumers
thus it is through these links of traders that goods reach far away places
this is the age of the internet
one of the major benefits of the internet is that we can buy things of our need without going to the market
we can place orders for a variety of things through the phone and the internet and the goods are delivered at our home
medical representatives are also engaged in the selling of goods
thus buying and selling take place in different ways
there are also markets that we may not be aware of
this is because a large number of goods are bought and sold that we don’t use directly
a car factory purchases engines gears petrol tanks wheels etc
we do not usually see these types of buying and selling
there is a great difference between the shop owners in a weekly market and those in a shopping complex
the shop owners in a weekly market are small traders with little money to run the shop but the owners of shopping complexes or malls are big businessman with a lot of money
one thing is clear that the weekly market trader earns little compared to the profit of a regular shop owner in a shopping complex
thus we don’t see equality in market places
there are many who are not able to afford to buy even the cheapest goods while others are busy shopping in beautiful malls
market a market is a place where buying and selling take place
weekly market it is held on a specific day of the week
such markets do not have permanent shops
mall it is a large multi-storeyed air-conditioned building with shops on different floors
malls are found in urban areas
chain of market a series of markets that are connected like links in a chain because goods or products pass from one market to another
wholesaler the trader who buys a product in huge quantities from the producers and sells this product to small traders i
retailers retailer the trader who buys goods from the wholesaler in small quantity and sells this to the consumer
 a small farmer grows cotton on his small piece of land
once the harvesting is done cotton balls are collected
 these are taken to the local trader as the farmer had borrowed money from the trader to buy seeds fertilisers etc
 even though the market price is high the trader buys it at a meagre price from the farmer
the cloth market of erode  the bi-weekly market of erode in tamil nadu is one of the biggest cloth markets in the world
 cloth made by weavers from all over comes here for sale
 instructions about the type of cloth to be made are given in advance
 the weavers get yam from the merchants and supply them the cloth
 the arrangement between the merchant and the weaver is termed as a putting-out system
 it saves money of the weavers as they do not have to buy yam
likewise the problem of selling the cloth is also taken care of
 since weavers do not know the price of the cloth they are at a loss and get a very small amount
the garment exporting factory near delhi  erode merchants send the cloth to garments export centre in delhi
 the garments factory makes shirts to be sold to the chain of business from the us and europe
 they set a standard of quality and time
 faced with the pressure the garment centre tries to extract maximum work from their workers of the lowest cost
the shirt in the us  the shirts sent from garments export centres are sold in dollars in the us
 the shirts sold at rs  by the garment export centre sell at rs  in the us
 thus a chain of markets links the producers of cotton to the buyers at the supermarket
market and equality  foreign businessmen make huge profits in the market
 garment manufacturers only make moderate profits
 weavers at erode market and small farmers don’t make a huge profit
 poor people have no option but to depend on the rich
 poor are exploited in the market
 laws should be made to protect the interest of weavers and small farmers
cultivation of cotton is a very complicated and difficult task
it is very expensive too because it requires high levels of inputs such as fertilisers and pesticides
farmers therefore have to incur heavy expenses for which they need to borrow money from the local traders
the local traders are very clever people
they give loan to such farmers and in turn make them promise to sell all their cotton to them
thus they take advantage of the poor financial condition of the farmers
here we can give an example of swapna who is also a cotton farmer and takes a loan from a local trader to meet all the expenses on cotton cultivation
as a result she has to sell all her cotton to that local trader a low price
thus farmers in spite of their hard labour never get a fair price
the cloth that is made by weavers is also brought here for sale
this cloth is bought by the cloth merchants and other traders
there are other weavers who make cloth under the instruction of the cloth merchants
these merchants supply cloth on order to garment manufacturers and exporters around the country
they purchase the yam and give instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth that is to be made
the weavers are happy because they do not have to spend their money on the purchase of yarn
they also get rid of the problem of selling the finished cloth
but at the same time they lose their freedom
they begin to depend on the merchants both for raw materials and markets
the arrangement between the merchant and the weavers is termed as the putting-out system
the erode merchant supplies the cotton cloth produced by the weavers to a garment-exporting factory near delhi
the garment exporting factory use the cloth to make shirts to export them to foreign buyers
these foreign buyers are powerful business persons
they demand the lowest price from the supplier
in addition they set high standards for quality of production and timely delivery
these conditions put the exporter in a light situation
still they accept the deal because they have nothing to do at the cost of their own benefit
they get the maximum work out of the workers at the lowest possible wages
thus their profit remains intact
the sufferers are always the workerslabourers who hardly fulfil their day-to-day needs
the weavers too are an exploited lot
thus everyone does not gain equality in the market
some make huge profits some make moderate profits
but nobody thinks about those who are working at the root level
they remain poor in spite of their hard labour
the cotton is pressed into bales which are sent for spinning into thread
putting-out system in this system the cloth merchant supplies the raw material to the weavers and receives the finished product
exporter one who sells goods in foreign countries
profit the amount that is left or gained from earnings after deducting all the costs
all adults in india have equal rights to vote during elections and this ‘power over the ballot box’ has been used by people to elect or replace their representatives for many years
however the feeling of equality on the basis of ‘one vote one person’ in reality does not extend to poor people face negligence and these people do not get justice in matters of health education etc
domestic helpers small farmers and many others are forced to work in hardships due to poverty a shortage of resources
people also face inequality on grounds of religion caste and gender in india
struggles for equality  poverty and discrimination have created inequalities in our society
 throughout the world people are fighting for their rights and equality trying to end the discriminator which they face
 women’s struggle and movements for equality was one such group fighting for equality
 the tawa matsya sangh in madhya pradesh is also an example of people coming together to fight an issue
 there are many other struggles such as those of beedi workers fishermen agricultural laborers si dwellers etc
who have been fighting for equality and justice
 with the beginning of the construction of tawa dam in  till its completion in  large parts the forest and agricultural areas were submerged
thus the forest dwellers had to suffer a set bad they earned very little
in response the government granted fish rights to the villagers in 
 with the tms taking over the fishery workers were able to increase their earnings substantially
the indian constitution as a living document  the foundation of all movements for justice and the inspiration for all the poetry and songs on equals is the recognition that all people are equal
 movements and struggle for equality in india promote equality
 indian constitution is a living document recognizing greater equality on existing and other issues
 it guarantees dignity self-respect and equality all of which are required in a democracy
india is a democracy and the soul of democracy is equality
but we do not see equality at any place except on the polling day on which every adult citizen of india enjoys the equal right to vote
these people have to face discriminations because they lack resources
others extend their support for the cause
in india there are several struggles in which people have come together to fight for issues that they believe are important
the methods used by the women’s movement to raise issues of equality can be mentioned here
another example can be given of the tawa matsya sangh in which people came together to fight for an issue
the tawa dam began to be built in  and was completed in 
it submerged large areas of forest and agricultural land
the forest dwellers were left with nothing
some of the displaced people began fishing in the reservoir
in  the government gave the eights for fishing in the tawa reservoir to private contractors
these contractors were not friendly
they began to push out the local people
the villagers now stood united and set up tawa matsya sangh tms to protect their rights
finally the government accepted their demand and from jan
  they began fishing
later on the tms set up a cooperative which would buy the catch from the fishworkers at a fair price
now they were able to earn three times more than they earned earlier
in a democracy there are always communities and individuals trying to expand the idea of democracy and push for greater recognition of equality on existing as well as new issues
thus issues of equality are central to democracy
the dignity and self-respect of each person can only be realized if heshe has adequate resources
reservoir an artificial lake where water is collected and kept in quantity for use
dam a dam is built across a river at sites where one can collect a lot of water
contractor one that contracts to perform work or provide supplies
creative expression writers singers dancers and artists have also been active against inequality
they use their pen or their voice or their ability to dance to draw attention to issues of inequality
this is known as creative expression
 we need a constitution  to provide a set of basic rules to allow minimal coordination amongst the members of a society
 to specify how the government would be constituted and who has power to make decisions in the society
 to lay some limitations on government’s power by guaranteeing rights to the citizens
 to enable the government to fulfill aspirations of a society and create conditions for a just society
 to express the fundamental identity of people

the judiciary has the power to enforce the fundamental rights but the directive principles of state are not enforceable by law

the legislature frames the laws and the executive enforces them to run the administration
in such a manner the legislature controls the executive and in turn it is controlled by the executive
different types of executives are parliamentary semi-presidential presidential monarchical or ceremonial etc
a distinction can be made between the parliamentary and the presidential executives
in a parliamentary system the real head of executive is the prime minister and the president is the nominal head
the prime minister is assisted by the council of ministers and advises the president
the president enjoys the right to be informed of all important matters and functioning of the council of ministers
the vice president is the ex-office chairman of rajya sabha and acts for the president when the office of the president falls vacant
the council of minister is responsible collectively to the house of the people and it shall not exceed % of total number of members of the house of the people

 there have been demands to bring reforms in the un
two demands have been raised i
 on the reform of structures and processes there has been the demand to increase the membership of permanent and non-permanent in un security council
 while some other countries want the role of un to be confined to development and humanitarian work
the resolution reflected three main complaints
 to look into the complaints over the restructuring of the un on st january  the un secretary general kofi arman initiated an inquiry into how the un should be reformed
 criteria for inclusion of a new member was decided
some of them were that a new member must be a major economic and military power a substantial contributor to the un budget etc
 different governments saw advantages in some criteria and disadvantages in others depending on their interests and aspirations
a demand to abolish the veto power altogether was also raised
many perceived the veto to be in conflict with the concept of democracy and sovereign equality in the un
 permanent members have two privileges i
veto power and permanency in the security council
 by veto power means that if a permanent member cast a veto in a negative manner then it may state the decision
 without veto power there is the danger that the great powers would lose interest in the world body and without their support the body would be ineffective
jurisdiction of the un  a meeting was held in september  to celebrate the th anniversary of the united nation and to review the situation
 the leaders in this meeting decided some steps that should be taken to make the un more relevant in the changing content
 steps include establishment of a human rights council creation of a democracy fund an agreement to wind up the trusteeship council etc
india and the un reforms  india has always supported the restructuring of the united nations
it believes that a strengthened and revitalised un is desirable in a changing world
it supports an increase in the number of both permanent and non-permanent members
 it also argues that an expanded council with more representative will enjoy greater support in the world community
 india itself wishes to be a permanent member in a restructured un
india is the world’s largest democracy and the second most populous country in the world
 the country’s economic emergence on the world stage is another factor that perhaps justifies india’s claim to a permanent seat in the security council
 despite india’s wish to be a permanent veto holding member of the un some countries question its inclusion
they are concerned about indo-pak relations india’s nuclear capabilities etc
the un in a unipolar world  it is believed by many countries that the reform and restructuring of the un could help the un cope better with a unipolar world in which the us was the most powerful country
 the us stands as the only superpower after the disintegration of ussr hence us power cannot be easily checked
 within the un the influence of the us is considerable
as the single largest contributor to the un the us has unmatched financial power
 the un is not therefore a great balance to the us
nevertheless in a unipolar world in which the us is dominant the un can and has served to bring the us and the rest of the world into discussions over various issues
 the un is an imperfect body but without it the world would be worse off
it has  member countries
the g-  members the us japan germany france uk italy canada russia china and saudi arabia have more than  per cent votes in imf
it provides loans and grants to the member countries especially developing countries

after the cold war some of the changes occurred which affected the functioning of the un i
collapse of soviet union emergence of china and india as rising powers entry of new members and confrontations with the challenges like genocide civil war ethnic conflict terrorism nuclear proliferation etc
they faced two kinds of reforms over the time i
in  the un general assembly adopted a resolution over the reform of un complaining no longer representation by contemporary powers dominance of few countries based on western values etc
following these in january  kofi annan un secretary general initiated on “how the un should be reformed” 
since  onwards a new member to be added to the un should fulfil the parameters of being a major economic and military power contributor to un budget a populous one should respect democracy and human rights and to make council more representative
in september  the heads of all member states of the un took the steps to make the un more relevant by creating peace building commissions human rights council agreement to achieve millennium development goals condemnation of terrorism creation of democracy fund and an agreement to wind up trusteeship council
india is a big supporter of restructuring of the un to promote development and cooperation among states to composition of security council arid to include more representation in council for its political support
being a citizen of india we would firmly support india’s candidature for the permanent membership of un security council on the grounds to be second most populous country largest democracy initiations in the un economic emergence and regular financial contributor to the un
some countries question india’s inclusion as permanent members in the security council on the basis of its troubled relationship with pakistan nuclear weapon capabilities and if india included some emerging powers brazil germany japan south africa will also be accommodated
france and the usa advocate that africa and south america must be represented for they do not have any representation in the present structure
despite the above mentioned strong activities of the us the un serves a purpose in bringing the world together in dealing with conflicts and social and economic issues
the un provides a space within which arguments against specific us attitude and policies are heard and compromised

the root of this danger is the other country which by threatening military action endangers the core values of sovereignty and independence
 there are three choices with the government in response to the threat of war
these choices are to surrender to prevent the other side from attack and to defend itself during the war and four components of traditional security i
deterrence defence balance of power and alliance building
 a good part of maintaining a balance of power is to build up one’s military power that coordinate their actions to deter or defend against military attack
 according to the traditional view of security most threats to a country’s security come from outside its borders
 within a country the threat of violence is regulated by an acknowledged central authority i
 but in world politics each country has to be responsible for its own security
traditional notions of internal security  traditional security must concern itself with internal security which has not been given so much importance due to various reasons
 after the second world war internal security was more or less assured to the powerful countries on the earth
 most of the european countries faced no serious threats from groups or communities living within those borders
hence these countries gave importance to external security
 the main concern for the external security was the era of cold war
both the superpowers were afraid of attacks from each other
 the colonies which became independent were under fear of conversion of cold war into a hot war
 the newly independent african and asian countries were more worried about the prospect of military conflict with neighbouring countries
 they were worried about internal threats from separatist movements which wanted to form independent countries
 traditional views of security also gives importance to other forms of cooperation like disarmament arms control and confidence building
 disarmament requires all states to give up certain kinds of weapons
 arms control regulates the acquisition or development of weapons e
united states and soviet union signed a number of other arms control treaties
 confidence building means a process in which countries share ideas and information with their rivals
 force is both the principle threat to security and the principle means of achieving security in traditional security
non-traditional notions  the non-traditional notions of security go beyond military threats to include a wide range of threats and dangers affecting the condition of human existence
 non-traditional views of security have been called ‘human security’ or ‘global security’
 by human security we mean the protection of people more than the protection of states
 proponents supporters of the ‘narrow concept’ of human security focus on violent threats to individuals
 on the other hand proponents of the ‘broad concept’ of human security argue that the threat agenda should include hunger disease and natural disaster
 the idea of global security emerged in the s in response to the global nature of threats such as global warming aids and so on
new sources of threats  some new sources of threats have emerged about which the world is concerned to a large extent
these includes terrorism human rights global poverty migration and health epidemics
 there are three types of human rights
the first is political rights second is economic and social rights and the third type is the rights of colonised people
 another type of insecurity is global poverty
rich states are becoming richer whereas poor states are getting poorer
 poverty in the south has also led to large scale migration to seek a better life especially better economic opportunities in the north
 health epidemics such as hv-aids bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars have been increasing across countries through migration
 it is important to understand that the expansion of the concept of security does not mean to include everything
 to qualify as a security problem an issue must share a minimum common criterion
cooperative security  dealing with certain issues of security require cooperation rather than military confrontation
military help can be taken to deal with terrorism but it will be of no use in dealing with issues like poverty migration and so on
 it becomes important to devise strategies that involve international cooperation which can be bilateral regional continental or global
 cooperative security may also involve a variety of other players both international and national
 but cooperative security may also involve the use of force as a last resort
the international community may have to sanction the use of force to deal with dictatorship
 the second component of india’s security strategy has been to strengthen international norms and international institutions to protect its security interests
 the third important component of india’s security strategy is geared towards meeting security challenges within the country
 the fourth component is to develop its economy in a way that the vast mass of citizens are lifted out of poverty and misery
‘security’ is freedom from ‘threats’ security protects core values from threatening by preventing limiting and ending the war
the notions of security can be grouped into two i
traditional concept and non-traditional concept
traditional notion includes both external and internal threats
external threats experience military war balance of power and alliance building threats whereas internal includes internal peace and order
the means of traditional security limit the violence upto maximum extent through disarmament arms-control and confidence building
disarmament bounds states to give up certain kinds of weapons
arms control regulates acquisition of weapons and confidence building share ideas and information with rival countries
non-traditional security focuses on human and global security by covering all of human kinds
human security in a narrow sense protects individuals from internal violence only whereas broadly it protects from hunger diseases and natural disasters
global security responds to threats like global warming international terrorism health epidemics like aids bird flue and so on
new sources of threats include terrorism human rights global poverty migration and health epidemics
terrorism refers to political violence targeting civilians deliberately and indiscriminately
human rights threats involve political rights economic and social rights as well as rights of colonised people and indigenous minorities
global poverty suffers from low per capita income and economic growth and high population migration creates international political friction as states pursue different rules for migrants and refugees
health epidemics cover hiv-aids bird flu and severe acute respiratory syndrome sars through migration business tourism and military operations
cooperative security is required to alleviate poverty manage migration refugee movements and control epidemics
cooperation may be bilateral regional continental or global depending on the nature of threat and willingness and ability of countries to respond either nationally or internationally
india has faced both traditional and non-traditional threats to its security
india’s security strategy has four broad components i
strengthening military capabilities to strength international norms and institutions to meet security challenges inside the border and to develop to lift citizens out of poverty missing and economic inequalities
security an essence for existence of human life to protect from threats either external or internal
arms control it regulates acquisition of weapon
disarmament it bounds states to give up certain kinds of weapons to avoid mass destruction
confidence building a process in which different countries share ideas and information with rival countries by intimating each other about their military plans
global poverty it refers to a country to be suffered from low incomes and less economic growth to be categorised as least developed or developing countries
migration it is the movement of human resources from one state to another due to some particular reasons

nieo new international economic order 
 there is a decline in the availability of cultivable land and a substantial portion of existing agricultural land is losing fertility
 billion people in developing countries have no access to safe water and 
 billion have no access to sanitation according to the human development report 
 the loss of biodiversity continues due to destruction of habitat in areas which are rich in species
the act of deforestation takes place for personal gains removing the natural inhabitants
 another danger to ecosystems and human health is a steady decline in the total amount of ozone in the earth’s stratosphere
even the coastal waters are becoming increasingly polluted due to land-based activities
 the environmental consequences of economic growth acquired an increasingly political character from the s onwards
 international agencies like the united nations environment programme unep started holding international conferences to deal with environment issues
the protection of global ‘commons’  commons’ are the resources shared by the community as a whole not individually
 in the world there are some areas which are located outside the sovereign jurisdiction of any one state and hence require common governance by the international community
this is known as global commons
they include earth’s atmosphere antarctica the ocean floor and outer space
 a number of agreements were signed which includes the antarctic treaty  the montreal protocol  and the antarctic environmental protocol 
 the history of outer space as a global commons shows that the management of these areas is thoroughly influenced by north-south inequalities
common but differentiated responsibilities  there were differences between the countries of the north and the south over environment issues
 the northern countries want everyone to be equaliy responsible for ecological conservation
 the developing countries of the south believes that the ecological degradation is the product of industrial development undertaken by the developed countries
 in the rio summit  it was accepted that special needs of the developing countries must be taken into account in the development and interpretation of rules of international environmental law
 the  united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc also provides that the parties should act on the basis of equity
 it was accepted that a large amount of greenhouse gas emission has originated in developed countries and per capita emissions in developing countries are relatively low
 the kyoto protocol is an international agreement setting targets for industrialised countries to cut their greenhouse gas emissions
commons property resources  it represents common property for the group but with a rule that members of the group have both rights and duties with respect to the nature levels of use of a given resource
 but issues like privatisation agricultural intensification population growth and ecosystem degradation have caused common property to dwindle in size
india’s stand on environmental issues  india has signed and ratified kyoto protocol  in august 
developing countries like india and china were exempt from the requirements of the kyoto protocol
 at the g- meeting in june  india pointed out that the per capita emission rates of the developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world
 the indian government is already participating in global efforts through a number of programmes like energy conservation act  electricity act of  and so on
 in  a review of the implementation of the agreements at the earth summit in rio was undertaken by india
 india suggested that the developing countries must get financial resources and clean technologies from the developed countries in order to meet unfccc commitments
environmental movements  some of the most significant responses to the challenge of environmental degradation has come from groups of environmentally conscious volunteers working in different parts of the world
 the forest movements of the south in mexico chile brazil malaysia indonesia continental africa and india are faced with enormous pressures regarding forest clearing
 another groups of movements are those involved in struggles against mega-dams
in india narmada bachao aandolan is one of the best known of these movements
resource geopolitics  resource geopolitics means who gets what when where and how
 throughout the cold war the industrialised countries of the north adopted a number of methods to ensure a steady flow of resources
 oil countries to be the most important resource in global strategy
the immense wealth associated with oil generates political struggles to control it
 west asia specifically the gulf region accounts for about  per cent of global oil production
 another important resource relevant to global politics is water
regional variations and scarcity of freshwater in some parts of the world is a leading source of conflicts in the st century
 a number of studies show that countries that share rivers and many countries do share rivers are involved in military conflicts with each other
the indigenous people and their rights  as per the united nations indigenous population comprises the descendants of peoples who inhabited the present territory of a country at the time when persons of a different culture arrived there from other parts of the world
 indigenous people voices in world politics to treat them equally with other communities
 the areas occupied by indigenous people include central and south america africa india and south-east asia
 the indigenous people appeal to governments to come to terms with the continuing existence of indigenous nations as enduring communities with an identity of their own
 issues related to the rights of the indigenous communities have been neglected in domestic and international politics for very long
environmental concerns in global politics cover losing fertility of agricultural land and grazing depletion of water resources as well as loss of bio-diversity real danger to eco-system and coastal pollution deteriorating of marine environment 
environmental consequences of economic growth acquired a political shape from s onwards following a book published in  namely limits to growth and initiatives taken by united nations environment programme unep to promote co-ordination and effective response on environment at global level
the earth summit held in rio-de-janerio brazil in  revealed different views i
global north the first world countries and global south the third world countries
global north was concerned with the issues of ozone depletion and global warming and global south focused on economic development and environment management by agenda 
global commons refer to the areas or regions which require common governance by international community on major problems of ecological issues i
discovery of ozone hole over antarctic earth’s atmosphere and ocean floor associated with technology and industrial development
the rio declaration at the earth summit in  adopted the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities ‘refering special needs of developing countries in the fields as development application and interpretation of rules of international environmental law to protect environment by both developing nations in a responsible manner
the  united nations framework convention on climate change unfccc also emphasised to protect the climate system on the basis of equity and in accordance with their common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities
example-largest and current global emissions of greenhouse gases originated in developed nations hence low emissioned developing countries like india and china have been exempted from kyoto protocol held in japan in 
common property resources refer to a group who have both rights and duties with respect to nature levels of use and the maintenance of a given resource with mutual understanding and practices i

 the policy of india was not ‘fleeing away’ but was in favour of actively intervening in world affairs to soften cold war rivalries

both the powers became reluctant to initiate war to protect world from large scale destruction as they were a
vare that it will not lead only political aim to them
the greed of expansion of their spheres of influence divided the world into alliances
the soviet unriri created eastern alliance known as warsaw pact
smaller states „maine either the alliance to get the promise of protection weapons and economic aid against their local rivals
superpower required them to gain on access to vital resources territory to launch weapons and troops to spy on each other and economic support
despite of occurring crisis in korea vietnam and afghanistan both the superpowers behaved rationally and responsibly

five founder members of nam were yugoslavia’s josip broz tito india’s jl nehru egypt’s leader gamal abdel nasser indonesia’s sukarno and ghana’s kwame nkrumah
the majority of nam members was categorised as least developed countries ldcs which initiated economic development under the head of new international economic order nieo
india responded to growth of cold war into two fold
first it stayed away from alliances and secondary it raised voice against newly decolonised countries becoming part of either the alliance
nam served india’s interests also to participate in international decisions and maintained balance between two superpowers
india’s policy was criticised on grounds of possessing contradictory postures i
signed treaty of friendship with the ussr in august  for  years and developed good relations with the us during bangladesh crisis
it is said that nam has lost its relevance after disintegration of ussr and end of cold war in 
nam is based on a resolve to democratise international system to redress existing inequities that poor and very small countries need not to follow any of the big powers instead they can pursue an independent foreign policy also
these core values make nam relevant even in today’s scenario as it has stood of adverse circumstances and served an important purpose of protecting the interests of third world countries

these were  internal weaknesses of soviet political and economic institutions failed to meet the aspirations of the people
 the economy of the soviet union became stagnant
the soviet economy used much of its resources in maintaining a nuclear and military arsenal
the soviet union too became stagnant due to rampant corruption the unwillingness to allow more openness in government and the centralisation of authority in a vast land
 a section of the society was not happy with the reforms of gorbachev
it was believed that the reforms introduced by gorbachev were at a very slow pace
 another reason for the collapse of ussr was the rise of nationalism and the desire for sovereignty within various republics including russia and the baltic republics
consequences of disintegration there are many consequences of the disintegration of ussr
they are as follows  it led to the end of cold war confrontations
there was no dispute of socialist ideology and capitalist ideology
 power relations in world politics changed and thus it led to change in the relative influence of ideas and institutions

 there was a need to make a total shift to a capitalist economy which meant rooting out completely any structures evolved during the soviet period
 shock therapy also involved a drastic change in the external orientation of these economics
 it also involved a break up of the existing
trade alliances among the countries of the soviet bloc

both the countries have collaborated over many scientific projects
the socialist revolution in russia in  gave birth to ussr with inspiration of socialism ensure a minimum standard of living for all its citizens and also the government subsidised basic necessities and productive assets were owned and controlled by the state
russia was the only republic among fifteen republics who dominates everything and people in the region
soviet union lagged behind the west in technology infrastructure and could not fulfil political aspirations of people
soviet invasion of afghanistan in  also weakened the system furthermore
mikhail gorbachev general secretary of communist party of soviet union in  initiated the policies of economic and political reforms to democratise the system which were opposed by leaders within communist party and contradictory view of people
the people of republic had been fed up with old style rule of soviet bloc and in dec  under the leadership of boris yeltsin an elected leader russia ukraine and baltics declared themselves independent

russia was accepted as successor state of soviet union by inheriting a soviet seat in un security council who accepted all international treaties and commitments of soviet union and carried out some nuclear disarmament measures with the us
now soviet union had been disintegrated on the grounds to maintain nuclear and military arsenals awareness of people of their backwardness than western capitalism as well as alienation of ordinary people who were exempted from any kind of privileges

shock therapy involved privatisation of property private firms emergence complete switch over to free trade and foreign direct investment financial opening up currency convertibility as well as break up of existing trade alliances among the countries of soviet bloc to maintain relations directly with the west
the constitution of newly democratic institutions was drafted in a hurry where strong executives appointed themselves as presidents due to weak parliament and lack of independent judiciary as in russia turkmenistan and uzbekistan
russia revived in  due to export of natural resources like oil natural gas and minerals which were available in abundance in azerbaijan kazakhstan russia turkmenistan and uzbekistan
and from where these pipelines crossed were paid on rent
most of the former soviet republics had civil wars and insurgencies as in russia two republics chechnya and dagestan had violent secessionist movements in central asia
czechoslovakia was also split into two

it remained with all its powers enhanced and intact
 kuwait was invaded by iraq in august  and was subsequently annexed
after a series of diplomatic attempts failed at convincing iraq to quit its aggression the united nations mandated the liberation of kuwait by force
’  the first gulf war took place in which iraq was defeated by a coalition force of  troops from  countries
it was known as ‘operation desert storm’ or ‘first gulf war’
 the war was overwhelmingly american
it revealed the vast technological gap that had opened up between the us military capability and other countries
 during this era it was believed that the us had withdrawn into its internal affairs and was not fully engaged in world politics
 still the us showed its military powers
firstly in  in response to yugoslavian actions against the pre-dominantly albanian population in the province of kosovo
secondly in response to the bombing of the us embassies in nairobi kenya and dar-es- salaam
 ‘operation infinite reach’ launched by the us was a series of cruise missile strikes on al-qaeda terrorist targets in sudan and afghanistan
 and the ‘global war on terror  on th september  four american commercial aircrafts were hijacked and flew into important buildings in the us
 the first and second airline crashed into the north and south towers of the world trade centre new york the third crashed into the pentagon building arlington virginia and the fourth aircraft came down in a field in pennsylvania
these attacks came to be known as ‘’
 the us response to  was swift and ferocious
 the us launched ‘operation enduring freedom’ as a part of its ‘global war on terror’
 the operation was against all those suspected to be behind the  attack mainly al- qaeda and the taliban regime in afghanistan
 arrests were made all over the world by the us forces often without the knowledge of the government of the persons being arrested
 these persons were transported across countries and detained in secret prisons
the iraq invasion  operation iraqi freedom’ was launched by the us on th march  and was joined by more than forty other countries
 the purpose of the invasion was to prevent iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction wmd
 the us invasion of iraq was both a military and political failure as around  us military personnel were lost and iraqi casualities were much higher
constraints on american power  there are three constraints on american power
the institutional architecture of the america is the first constraint
 the second constraint is domestic in nature and stems from the open nature of american society
there is a deep scepticism regarding the purposes and methods of government in american political culture
india’s relationship with the us  during the cold war india closest friendship was with the soviet union
 over the years india decided to liberalise its economy and integrate it with the global economy
this made india an attractive economic partner for a number of countries including the us
 two new factors emerged in indo-us relations in recent years
they include   technological dimension  the role of the indian-american diaspora
 there are three different strategies to decide what kind of relationship india should have with usa
they are as follows   those indian analysts who see international politics in terms of military power prefer that india should maintain its distance from us and should focus upon increasing its own national power
 a third group of analysts advocate that india should take the lead in establishing the coalition of countries from developing world
 indo-us relations are too difficult to manage by a sole strategy
there should be mixing of foreign policy strategies of deal with the us
meaning of hegemony  the word ‘hegemony’ means the leadership or predominance of one state over others by virtue of its military economic political power and cultural superiority
 politics is all about gaining power
in world politics countries and groups of countries are engaged in constantly trying to gain and retain power
 it is important to understand the distribution of power among the countries of the world in order to understand world politics
 during the cold war era there were two superpowers the us and the ussr
but after the disintegration of ussr only a single power was left i
 the international system dominated by a sole superpower or hyper-power is sometimes called a ‘unipolar system’
hegemony as hard power  hegemony relates to the relations patterns and balances of military capability between states
 the base of us power lies in the overwhelming superiority of its military power
it is both absolute and relative
 the military dominance of the us is not just based on higher military spending but on a qualitative gap
 but still the us invasion of iraq reveals weakness of american power as it was not able to force the iraqi people into submitting to the occupation forces of the us-led coalition
 in this sense hegemony is reflected in the role played by the us in providing global public goods
the best examples of global public goods are sea-lanes of communication slocs internet roads etc
 the economic preponderance of the us is inseparable from its structural power which is the power to shape the global economy in a particular way
 another example of the structural power of the us is the academic degree called the masters in business administration mba
the idea of teaching skills for business is uniquely american
hegemony as soft power  in this type of hegemony it implies class ascendancy in the social political and particularly ideological spheres
 it suggests that a dominant power not only possess military power but also ideological resources to shape the behaviour of competing and lesser powers
 the us predominance in the world is based not only on its military power and economic powers but on its cultural presence
 during the cold war the us scored notable victories in the area of structural power and soft power rather than hard power
overcoming the hegemony  it is important to understand that there is no single power to balance the us military
there are various strategies which can be helpful to overcome the hegemony
 according to the bandwagon strategy it is suggested that instead of engaging in activities opposed to the hegemonic power it is advisable to extract benefits by operating within the hegemonic system
 hide strategy implies staying as far removed from the dominant power as possible
china russia and the european union are many examples of this behaviour
america refers to the united states of america
it covers two continents—the north and the south america the us is only one of the countries of the continent which is a symbol of us hegemony
after the disintegration of ussr in  the first instance of us hegemony came into observation through operation desert storm by the un during first gulf war to retreat iraqi forces from kuwait
this operation was dominated and won by the us due to vast technological gap between the us military capability and other states
william jefferson bill clinton the newly elected president of the us in  and again in  focused on soft issues like democracy promotions climate change and world trade rather than of military power and security
the above mentioned policies of the us were contradicted in response to yugoslavian action against predominant albanian population in kosovo by targeting bombards through operation infinite against al-qaeda in response to the bombings of us embassies in nairobi kenya dar-es-salaam and tanzania in 
on  september  nineteen hijackers hailing from a number of arab countries took control of four commercial aircrafts shortly after take off and crushed into world trade centre in new york pentagon building in arlington
virginia us defence department and the capital building of the us congress in pennysylvania came to be known as event of  in the us
bush won the elections in the us succeeding bill clinton
the us launched operation enduring freedom against all those suspected behind attack in  mainly al-qaeda and taliban regime
the us forces made arrests all over the world transported and detained the persons in secret prisons like guantanamo bay a us navy base in cuba where the prisoners did not enjoy the protection of international law or the law of their own country or that of the us
even the un representatives were not allowed to meet these persons
on  march  the us launched operation iraqi freedom to prevent iraq from developing weapons of mass destruction wmd in the ostensible purpose to control oil fields and installing a regime in iraq friendly to us
hegemony is an international system with only one centre of power to be gained and retained in the form of military domination economic political chart and central superiority which was enjoyed only by the us after disintegration of soviet union
hegemony as hard power is based on military capabilities of a country and the us has proved it
the us today spends more on its military than the next  powers and even technologically no other power can match with the us
hegemony as structural power must sustain global structure in economic sense
the us has provided global public goods as sea lanes of communications slocs as well as accounts for  percent of world trade if eu is included and  per cent in world economy
the us has contributed basic economic structure in the form of bretton woods system and degree in mba
hegemony as soft power implies class ascendency in social political and ideological spheres which is more effective than coercion to more hand in hand and the us was proved ultimately triumphant in this
though the us has been a hegemonic power still it experiences some constraints in itself as institutional architecture division of power
after the collapse of soviet union india decided to liberalise its economy and integrate it with global economy
hence the us also found india an attractive economic partner due to technological dimension and the role of indian-american diaspora
india needs an appropriate mix of foreign policy strategies to deal with the us
either india should maintain aloofness from washington and comprehend its military power or to establish mutual convergences or to lead a coalition in weaning the hegemony assay from its dominance
russia china and european union have opted this policy
both the policies are known as bandwagon strategy and to hide respectively
america it covers two continents of north and south america and the us is only one of the countries of american continent that symbolises us hegemony
 to denote a series of attacks on the us by hijackers from arab countries on  sep 
it was the most disastrous attack on the us
guantanamo bay a naval base in cuba set up by the us where prisoners are forbidden of the protection of international law or law of their own country or that of the us
hegemony an international system to dominate world by only one superpower
qualitative gap it signifies us superiority in technology and no other power could dare to challenge the us
bandwagon strategy to extract benefits by operating within hegemonic system in place of opposing it
global village it refers to the us as the village headman and all the nations as its members are neighbours
manufacturing consent it refers to win the consent of countries to the dominating power in a manner favourable to ascendancy of the dominant class
bretton woods system a basic economic structure of world set up by the us after second world war
sea lanes of communication slocs it is the naval power of hegemony that underwrites the law of the sea and ensures freedom of navigation in international waters
these sea routes commonly waded by merchant ships

though eu bears common interests
still its member states have their own foreign relations and defence policies that are often at odds with each other i

many of them joined indian union
 travancore hyderabad kashmir and manipur initially refused to join indian union
government’s approach  the then interim government took a firm steps against the possible division of india into small principalities of different sizes
 the government’s approach was guided by three considerations  the people of most of the princely states clearly wanted to become part of the indian union
 the government was prepared to be flexible in giving autonomy to some regions
 consolidation of the territorial boundaries of the nation had assumed supreme importance
instrument of accession  the rulers of the most of the states signed a document called the ‘instrument of accession’ but accession of the junagarh hyderabad kashmir and manipur proved more difficult than the rest
 after initial resistance in september  hyderabad was merged with indian union by a military operation
the government did so without consulting the popularly elected legislative assembly of manipur
 after independence this idea was postponed because the memory of partition was still fresh and the fate of the princely states had not been decided
 after a long movement in december  andhra pradesh was created on linguistic basis
 this commission accepted that the boundaries of the state should reflect the boundaries of different languages
this led to the creation of  states and  union territories

public versus private sector  india adopted ‘mixed economy’ where elements of both public and private sector exist together
 critics argued that the planners refused to provide the private sector with enough space and the stimulus to grow
the enlarged public sector produced powerful vested interests that created enough hurdles for private capital

 the issue of reservations for ‘other backward classes’ became very controversial in bihar and following this the mandal commission was appointed by the janata party government at the centre
the non-congress parties opposed the congress due to personalisation of politics
the ‘marxist-leninist’ groups were strong in west-bengal which used arms and insurgent techniques to overthrow capitalist order to establish political system
but the state government took stringent measures to suppress them
he made people aware not to obey illegal and ‘immoral orders’ by a massive demonstration in delhi’s ramlila ground on june   as well as indira gandhi’s elections were also declared invalid on grounds to use government servants inter-election campaign on an election petition filed by raj narain a socialist leader
the government declared the strike illegal and deployed the territorial army to protect railway trades
thus strike was called off after twenty days without any settlement
before the declaration of emergency many differences arose between the government and the ruling party leading to a strain between judiciary legislature and executive on issues of intervention in constitutional provisions by government or parliament
it was proved in the case of keshavanand bharti where the judiciary declared that parliament cannot amend in constitutional basic features in a controversial manner
it mixed up constitutional interpretations and political ideologies rapidly
the proclamation of emergency in  had far reaching consequences and affected every spheres of life such as а lt affected civil liberties by making large-scale arrests as well as citizen’s right to life and liberty were also taken away
b it affected relationship between the executive and judiciary to bring new changes in the constitution by nd amendment like duration of legislatures elections can be postponed by one year during an emergency
c it affected mass media also i
after emergency was imposed question and debates arose either emergency was necessary or not
the government argued that opposition party must allow elected ruling party to govern according to its policies whereas critics argued that people had the right to publicly protest against the government
the state commission headed by j
shah was appointed in may  by janata party government to enquire into several aspects of allegations of abuse of authority excesses and malpractices committed and action taken in the wake of emergency and shah commission found out to be many excesses committed maximum arrests under preventive detention law illegal restrictions on press and verbal orders to cut electricity at  a
emergency taught many lessons firstly to be difficult to do away with democracy secondly necessary the advice to proclaim emergency in writing by president by council of ministers thirdly it made everyone more aware of the value of civil liberties
as soon as the emergency was over and the lok sabha elections were announced in  to be turned into a referendum
hence politics after emergency was characterised by two major developments a  elections defeated congress on people’s verdict against emergency and opposition fought on the slogan ‘save democracy’
bmidterm elections  were held due to janata party lacked direction leadership and a common programme as well as could not bring any fundamental change in policies pursued by congress
the legacy of emergency of  was felt in every spheres of life and the politics which can be described as a period of constitutional and political crisis to have its origin in constitutional battle over the jurisdiction of the parliament and the judiciary
emergency in an emergency the federal distribution of power remain practically suspended and all powers were concentrated in the hands of union government
press-censorship newspapers were supposed to get prior approval before publishing any material
preventive detention the people were arrested on the groundapprehension to commit any offence in future
marxist-leninist this group was strong in west bengal which had taken to arms and insurgent techniques for overthrow of capitalist order and established political system
twenty point programme it was announced by indira gandhi to bring law and order and restore efficiency including land reforms land redistribution eradication of bonded labour etc
satyagraha it emphasised on peaceful demonstration as if people are fighting for truthfulness and lawfulness no need to adopt violent methods against the government or entities
popular movements depict a very unusual form of collective action
from time to time many popular movements took place for protest
here some novel tactics for protest are used
 party based movements keep close association with political parties and follow their objectives and ideologies
non-party movements do not keep association with any political parties and independent from specific ideologies

 in the early s the women of dubagunta in nellore district of andhra pradesh had enrolled in the adult literacy drive on a large scale
 it is during the discussion in the class that women complained of increased consumption of a locally brewed alcohol-arrack-by men in their families
origin of anti-arrack movement can be traced here

these movements are either party based and non-party based movements
party based movements are supported by political parties trade union movement in kolkata kanpur bombay etc
 and non-party based movements are based on the loss of faith in existing democratic institutions or electoral politics students and youth from different sections merge themselves
non-party movements emerged due to disillusions among many sections of society failure of janata experiment a gulf between urban industrial sector political instability existence of social inequality and sense of injustice

it opposed the construction of multipurpose dam known as narmada sagar project questioned ongoing developmental projects also
nba was shifted from its initial demand for rehabilitation to total opposition to the dam

the movements are not only about rallies or protests but these involve a gradual process of coming together by making people aware of their rights and expectations to contribute in the expansion of democracy rather than causing disruptions
the movement for right to information started in  on demand of records of famine relief work and accounts of labourers by mazdoor kisan shakti sanghthan mkss

mkss it was mazdoor kisan shakti sangathan which demanded records of famine relief work and accounts of labourers
the nation would not mean the negation of the region
 the one basic principle of the indian approach to diversity is the indian nation shall not deny the rights of different regions and linguistic groups to retain their own culture
 india adopted a democratic approach to the question of diversity
democracy allows the political expressions of regional aspirations and does not look upon them as anti- national
 democratic politics also means that regional issues and problems will receive adequate attention and accommodation in the policy making process
 soon after independence jammu and kashmir and some parts of north-east faced mass agitations in many parts for separation from india
 these events were followed by mass movement in many parts for the formation of linguistic states such as andhra pradesh karnataka maharashtra and gujarat
 with the passage of time the challenge of diversity was met by redrawing the internal boundaries of the country
jammu and kashmir  the ‘kashmir issue’ is always seen as a major issue between india and pakistan
 jammu and kashmir comprises three social and political regions
jammu-a mix of foothills and plains kashmir- heart of kashmir region ladakh-mountainous region with very little population which is equally divided between buddhists and muslims
 before  jammu and kashmir was a princely state
the state was having majority population of muslims but hari singh was a hindu ruler of the state
 in october  pakistan sent tribal infiltrators from its side to capture kashmir
this forced hari singh to ask for indian military help
 indian army successfully drove out infiltrators from kashmir valley and hari singh signed an instrument of accession with the government of india
 it was agreed that once the situation will be normalised the views of the people of jammu and kashmir will be ascertained about their future and india agreed to maintain the autonomy of jammu and kashmir
external and internal disputes  externally pakistan has always claimed that kashmir valley should be part of pakistan
 pakistan sponsored a tribal invasion of the state of  and consequence of it a part of the state came under pakistani control
 india claims this area under illegal occupation whereas pakistan describes this area as ‘azad kashmir
’  internally there is a dispute about the status of kashmir within the indian union
state has its own constitution
 the special attention provokes two opposite reactions
 a section of people outside j&k feels that article  should therefore be revoked and j&k should be like any other state in india
 another section mostly kashmiries believe that autonomy conferred by article  is not enough
politics since   between  and  the congress party exercised a lot of influence on the politics of the state
 national conference remained in power with the active support of congress for some time but later it merged with the congress
thus congress gained direct control over the government of the state
 in  indira gandhi reached an agreement with sheikh abdullah and he became the chief minister of the state
 farooq abdullah succeeded after death of his father as chief minister in 
 farooq abdullah was soon dismissed by the governor his dismissal due to the intervention of the centre generated a feeling of resentment in kashmir
 ups and down in state politics continued till  when national conference agreed to have an electoral alliance with the congress
insurgency and effect  in  assembly election the national conference-congress alliance gained a massive victory and farooq abdullah returned as chief minister
 by  the state had come in grip of a militant movement mobilised around the cause of a separate kashmir nation
 in  j&k experienced a fair election in which national conference was replaced by people’s democratic party pdp-congress coalition government
separatism  separatism surfaced in kashmir ’rom  and is made up of various strands
 one strand of separatists wanted a separate kashmir nation independent of india and pakistan
 jammu and kashmir is one of th living examples of plural society and politics
 despite diversities and divergence on the one hand and the continued situation of conflict on the other the plural and secular culture of the state has remained largely intact
punjab  the decade of s witnessed major developments in the state of punjab
 social composition of the state was changed first with partition and later-after the carving out of haryam and himachal pradesh
 the akali dal which was formed in  as the political wing of the sikhs had led the movement for the formation of a ‘punjabi suba
 during the s a section of akalis began to demand political autonomy for the region
this was reflected in a resolution passed in a conference at anandpur sahib in 
 in june  the government of india carried out ‘operation blue star’ code name for army action in the golden temple in which the government could successfully flush out the militants
 in this operation temple was damaged which hurt the sikh sentiments and their faith was betrayed
 prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated on st october  outside her residence by her sikh bodyguards as a revenge of ‘operation blue star
’  in many parts of northern india violence broke give space out against sikh community and continued for almost a week which results in the killings of more than two thousand sikhs
road to peace  in  the new prime minister rajiv gandhi initiated a dialogue with moderate akali leaders and in july  a peace agreement was signed between rajiv gandhi and harchand singh longowal the president of akali dal
 the agreement known as rajiv gandhi- longowal accord or the punjab accord
 the cycle of violence continued nearly for a decade and peace returned to punjab by the middle of s
the alliance of akali dal badal and the bjp scored a major victory in  in the first normal elections in the state in the post militancy era
the north-east  the north-east region of the country now consists of seven states also referred to as the ‘seven sister
’  the region witnessed a lot of change in 
 the vast international border and weak communication between the north-east and the rest of india have added to the delicate nature of politics there
 there were opposition and protest riots throughout the state on various issues
 at different points of time the central government had to create meghalaya mizoram and arunachal pradesh out of assam
secessionist movements  for autonomy there were secessionist movements in north-east region like mizoram and nagaland etc
 after independence the mizo hills area was made an autonomous district within assam
 movement for secession gained popular support after the assam government ‘failed to respond adequately to great famine of  in mizo hills
’  mizo’s anger led to formation of mizo national front mnf under the leadership of laldenga
 mnf fought guerilla war got support from pakistani government and secured shelter in east pakistan
 in  a peace agreement was signed between rajiv gandhi and laldenga
 this accord granted mizoram as full fledged statehood with special powers and mnf agreed to give up secessionist struggle
 thus the accord turn mizoram as one of the most peaceful places in the region
 the story of nagaland is similar to mizoram except that started much earlier and had not yet such a happy ending
movements against outsiders  the large scale migration into the north-east gave rise to a special kind of problem that pitted the ‘local’ communities against people who were seen as ‘outsiders’ or migrants
 the issue has taken political and sometimes violent form in many states of north- east
 the assam movement from  to  is the best example of such movements against ‘outsiders’
 in  the all assam students’ union aasu a students’ group not affiliated to any party led an anti-foreigner movement
movement demanded outsiders who had entered the state after  should be sent back
’ sikkim’s merger  at the time of independence sikkim was a ‘protectorate a state that is controlled and protected by other of india
 in  sikkim was merged with india and it became the nd state of the indian union
accommodation and national integration  regional aspirations are very much a part of democratic politics
expression of regional issues is not an aberration or an abnormal phenomenon
 the best way to respond to regional aspirations is through democratic negotiations rather than through suppression
 regional imbalance in economic development contributes to the feeling of regional discrimination
 goa was liberated in  from portuguese by an army operation
goa daman and diu was declared an union territories
s may be seen as a period of rising regional aspirations creating various regional movements which conclude in a negotiated settlement or accords between the government’s groups
indian approach maintained a balance in the principles of unity and diversity even by redrawing the internal boundaries of country in response to preserve the culture of different regions and linguistic groups
jammu and kashmir issues political aspiration north-east had no consensus to be a part of india and dravidian movement briefly toyed with the idea of separate country
jammu and kashmir comprised of three social and political regions namely kashmir jammu and ladakh region
on the issue of regional autonomy accession was promised on reference of people
special federal status guaranteed by article  to protect regional autonomy
during most of the period between  to  congress exercised a lot of influence on the politics of jammu and kashmir
finally in  sheikh became chief minister of the state
except it from  separatist politics was also surfaced in kashmir with the stronger demand for intrastate autonomy rather than state autonomy
in present scenario most of separatist in dialogue are trying to re-negotiate a relationship of the state with india
in punjab anandpur sahib resolution was passed at the conference of akali dal at anandpur sahib in  to ascertain regional autonomy and to redefine centre-state relationship
it had a limited appeal and akali government was dismissed in 
afterwards the movement launched by akali dal took the form of armed insurgency and resolution became controversial
but peace did not come easily violence led many excesses and fragmentation of akali dal
hence it led to president’s rule in the state
in  first normal elections in punjab were held in post militancy era and alliance of akali dal and bjp scored a major victory
the north-east region consisted of seven states referred to as ‘seven sisters’
bodos karbis dimasas demanded separate state in assam and issues were resolved with the grant of some autonomy to these issues
even ‘assam accord’ was signed over the issue of‘outsiders’ in assam in 
the assam movement was combination of cultural pride and economic backwardness as it was against outsiders to maintain cultural integration and poverty unemployment also existed despite natural resources like oil tea and coal
regional aspirations range from demands of statehood and economic development to autonomy and separation were coming up which taught many lessons to us i
expression of regional issues is not abnormal phenomenon to respond through democratic negotiations power sharing among groups and parties economic development of region and flexible federal system
goa was under the portuguese along with daman and diu which expected freedom in  but portuguese refused
goa wanted to be merged with motherland and suppressed from religious conversions and civil rights known as ‘goa problem’

 the bjp continued to consolidate its position in the elections of  and  and it emerged as the largest party in the  election and was invited to form government
 with the elections of  a long phase of coalition politics began in india
since then there have been nine governments at the centre all of which have either been coalition governments or minority governments supported by other parties
political rise of other backward classes  when the support for the congress among many sections of the ‘backward castes’ had declined this created a space for non-congress parties to get their support
 many of the constituents of the janata party like the bhartiya kranti dal and the samyukta party had a powerful rural base among some sections of the obc
‘mandal’ implemented  the period of s-s saw the emergence of many parties that sought better opportunities for obcs in education and employment and also raised the question of the share of power enjoyed by the obcs

 in february-march  large-scale violence against muslims took place in gujarat
the violence began from godhra
 this incident alert us to the dangers involved in using religious sentiments for political purposes
emergence of a new consensus  analysis shows that since  election the votes polled by the two parties-congress and bjp do not add upto more than  per cent
 the political competition during the nineties is divided between the coalition led by bjp and the coalition led by the congress
growing consensus  after  a consensus appears to have emerged among most parties which consists of following elements  agreement on new economic policies

during the decade of eighties five developments took place in country with long lasting impact i
end of congress system in  mandal issues in  new economic reforms in  ayodhya dispute in  and assassination of rajiv gandhi in 
elections in  led an era of coalitions with the defeat of congress party and it emerged several parties when no single party secured a clear majority of seats in any lok sabha election held since  and in this era regional parties played a crucial role in forming ruling alliances
the nineties also saw the emergence of powerful parties and movements to represent the dalits and backward castes as well as regional assertions
now there have been nine governments at the centre which have either been coalition government or minority governments supported by other parties or regional parties only
the constituents of janata party like bharatiya kranti dal and the ‘samyukt socialist party’ had a powerful rural base among some sections of the obcs as well as bamcef i
backward and minority classes employees federation was formed in  taking strong position in favour of political power to bahujan—the sc st obcs and minorities

ayodhya issue was started with the demolition of the babri masjid in ayodhya in december  to symbolise various changes in politics and debates about indian nationalism and secularism
these developments are associated with the rise of bjp and politics of‘hindutva’
the political processes after the s showed the emergence of broadly four groups of parties i
parties in coalition with congress parties in alliance with bjp left front parties others who are not part of the rest to make political competition multi-concerned

human rights commission criticised gujarat government’s role in failing to control violence and showed that government machinery also becomes susceptible to passion and alert us to dangers involved in using religious sentiments for political purposes
in the midst of severe competition and many conflicts a consensus appears to have emerged among most parties consisting of main four elements i
agreement or new economic policies acceptance of political and social claims of backward classes acceptance of role of state level parties in governance of country and emphasis on pragmatic considerations rather than ideological positions and political alliances without ideological agreement
in coalition government several political parties cooperate reducing the dominance of any one party within that coalition
in it government is formed on the basis of common minimum programme
the main reason behind this arrangement is that no party gets majority on its own in the parliament
if a coalition collapses confidence vote is held or a motion of no-confidence is taken
coalition government in context of india from - and - respectively after the parliamentary elections in may  national democratic alliance nda came into power with mr
narendra modi as the prime minister
although the bjp had got full majority on its own
at the national level the first coalition government of india was formed under the prime ministership of morarji desai that existed from  march  to  july  headed by the janta party
this government could not complete its tenure
the first coalition government in india which successfully completed its  year term was the bharatiya janata party-led national democratic alliance with mr
atal behari vajpayee as prime minister from -

people belonging to an ethnic group need not have the same religion or nationality
majoritarianism a belief that the majority community should be able to rule a country in whichever way it wants by disregarding the wishes and needs of the minority is majoritarianism
power sharing in sri lanka two major social groups are a sri lankan tamils b indian tamils
sinhala-speaking  per cent — buddhism tamil-speaking  per cent—hindus or muslims sri lankan tamils  per cent indian tamils  per cent
establishment of sinhala supremacy sri lanka emerged as an independent country in 
the democratically elected government adopted a series of measures to establish sinhala supremacy 
in  an act was passed to make sinhala the official language
the government followed preferential policies favouring sinhala applicants for university positions and government jobs
the constitution provided for state protection and fostering of buddhism
the sri lankan tamils felt that none of the major political parties led by the buddhist sinhala leaders were sensitive to their language and culture and the government policies denied them equal political rights
the sri lankan tamils launched parties and struggles for the recognition of tamil for regional autonomy and equality of opportunity in every field
therefore the measures adopted by the government to establish sinhala supremacy led to civil war
ethnic composition of belgium belgium is a small country in europe having a population of a little over one crore
 per cent of the country’s total population lives in the flemish region and speak dutch language
another  per cent people live in wallonia region and speak french
remaining one per cent of the belgians speak german
whereas in the belgian capital brussels  per cent of the population is french-speaking and  per cent is dutch-speaking
belgian power-sharing model the power-sharing arrangements made by the belgian leaders were different and more innovative than any other country
to recognize the existence of regional differences and cultural diversities they amended their constitution four times between  and 
constitution prescribes that the number of dutch and french-speaking ministers shall be equal in the central government
no single community can take decisions unilaterally
the state governments are not subordinate to the central government
brussels the capital has a separate government where both the communities have equal representation
a third kind of government ‘community government’ is elected by people belonging to one language community — dutch french and german speaking—no matter where they live
this government can decide on cultural educational and language related issues
‘lebanon’—conflict related to power-sharing disputes were resolved by power sharing people from various communities lived in lebanon’s capital city beirut and fought a bitter civil war amongst themselves
as a result thousands of people of various communities were either killed or lost their livelihood
at the end of this civil war lebanon’s leaders came together and agreed to some basic rules for power-sharing among different communities
as per these rules it was agreed that  the president would be from maronite sect of catholic christians  the prime minister must be from the sunni muslim community  deputy prime minister would be from an orthodox christian sect  speaker—a shia muslim
as per the pact the christians agreed not to seek french protection and muslims agreed not to seek unification with the neighbouring state of syria
prudential reasons prudential reasons stress that power-sharing would bring out better outcomes by helping to reduce the possibility of any conflict between the social groups and power-sharing is a good way to ensure the stability of political order through unity of the nation
moral reasons moral reasons uphold power-sharing as the very spirit of democracy
a democratic rule involves sharing power with those affected by its exercise
people have the right to be consulted and have equal participation in the government
principles of a good democracy  that power of a government must not vest in one person or a group of persons
 that people are the source of all political power
 that due respect be given to diverse groups and everyone should have a voice in the shaping of public policies
in a democracy ministers and government officials exercise power
they are responsible to the parliament or state assemblies
the judges appointed by the executive can check the functioning of executive or laws made by the legislature
the horizontal distribution of power is also called a system of checks and balances
power-sharing in contemporary democracies in contemporary democracies power-sharing takes the form of competition among different parties
such competition ensures that power does not remain in one hand and is shared among different political parties representing different social groups and ideologies
this type of sharing often leads to the formation of an alliance between two or more parties which goes to form a coalition government
this vertical division of power among different levels of governments is referred to as federalism
federalism is one of the major forms of power-sharing in modem democracies
key features of federalism are 
two or more levels of government
different levels of government govern the same citizens where each level has its own jurisdiction in specific matters of legislation taxation and administration
existence and authority of each level of government is constitutionally governed
the fundamental provisions of the constitution cannot be unilaterally changed
such changes require the consent of both the levels of government
courts have the power to interpret the constitution
the highest court acts as the umpire if any dispute arises between different levels of governments
sources of revenue for each level of government are specified to ensure its financial autonomy
federal system has dual objectives to safeguard and promote unity of the country and to accommodate regional diversity
they are also called ‘centrally administered territories’
coalition government a government formed by coming together of at least two political parties
usually partners in a coalition form a political alliance and adopt a common programme
for example national democratic alliance nda the united progressive alliance upa and the left front
india a federal country the constitution declares india as a union of states
although the word ‘federation’ is not used the indian union is based on the principles of federation
the constitution originally provided for a two-tier system of government the union government or the central government representing union of india and the state governments
a third-tier of federation was added in the form of panchayats and municipalities
as in any federation these different tiers enjoy separate jurisdiction
the constitution provides for a three-fold distribution of legislative powers between the union government and state government
it contains three lists  union list  subjects  state list  subjects  concurrent list  subjects
since india is an example of ‘holding together’ federation where the central government is more powerful vis-a-vis the states some states for example enjoy a special status like jammu & kashmir which has its own constitution
‘coming together’ federations this agreement induces independent states coming together on their own to form a bigger unit so that by pooling sovereignty and retaining identity they can increase their security
examples are usa switzerland and australia
‘holding together’ federations in this agreement a large country decides to divide its power between the constituent states and the national government
the central governments tend to be more powerful vis-a-vis the states
often different constituent units of the federation have unequal powers
some units are granted special powers for example india spain belgium
sharing of power between the union government and state governments the sharing of power between the union government and the state governments is basic to the structure of the constitution
the parliament cannot on its own change this arrangement
any change has to be first passed by both the houses of the parliament with at least two-third majority
it has then to be ratified by the legislatures of at least half of the total states
in case of any dispute about the division of powers the high courts and the supreme court make a decision
 the creation of linguistic states
boundaries of several old states of india were changed in order to create new states
this was done to ensure that people who spoke the same language lived in the same state
 restricting of centre-state relations
language policy of india our constitution did not give the status of national language to any one language
the formation of linguistic states united the country and made administration easier
the leaders of our country adopted a very cautious attitude in spreading the use of hindi
hindi was identified as official language
besides hindi there are  other languages recognized as scheduled languages by the constitution
major steps towards decentralization taken in  are  now it is constitutionally mandatory to hold regular elections to local government bodies
 seats are reserved in elected bodies for scheduled castes scheduled tribes and other backward classes obcs
 atleast one-third of all positions are reserved for women
 the state election commission was created to conduct panchayat and municipal elections
 the state governments are required to share some powers and revenue with local government bodies
structure of the new panchayati raj institutions rural local government is known by the name of panchayati raj
 each village or group of villages has a gram panchayat
panch president or sarpanch are directly elected by all the adult population of the village and is the decision-making body
 the panchayat works under the supervision of gram sabha with all the voters as its members
the local structure goes up to the district level—a group of gram panchayats form a panchayat samiti or block or mandal
all the panchayat samitis or mandals together constitute the zilla parishad which consists of elected members
 lok sabha members local mlas and officers are also members of the zilla parishad
its chairperson is the political head of the parishad
urban areas local bodies municipalities are set up in towns
big cities are constituted into municipal corporations
both are controlled by elected bodies consisting of people’s representatives
municipal chairperson is the political head of the municipality
the head of municipal corporation is an officer called the mayor
‘migrant’ anybody who shifts from one region or country to another region within a country or to another country usually for work or other opportunities is called migrant
civil rights movement led by martin luther king jr
 this movement lasted from -
the movement refers to a set of events and reform movements aimed at abolishing legal racial discrimination against african-americans
this movement practiced non- violent methods of civil disobedience against racially discriminatory laws and practices
black power movement this movement emerged in  and lasted till 
it was a more militant and anti-racist movement
the black power movement advocated even violence if necessary to end racism in the us
incident of two us athletes who protested at mexico olympics in  tommie smith and john carlos the us athletes received their medals wearing only a pair of black socks with no shoes to represent black poverty
the black-gloved and raised clenched fists were meant to symbolize black power
they were responding to social divisions and social inequalities
with this gesture their intention was to draw international attention to racial discrimination in the united states
peter norman wore a human rights badge on his shirt during the ceremony to show his support to the two americans
the medals were taken back from tommie smith and john carlos because the international olympic association held both of them guilty of violating the olympic spirit by making a political statement
origins of social differences  accident of birth we don’t choose to belong to our community
we belong to it simply because we were born into it
we experience social differences based on accident of birth in our everyday lives
 based on choices some of the differences are based on our choices
they don’t believe in god or any religion
some people choose to follow a religion other than the one in which they were born
most of us choose to study a subject of our interest and an occupation where we can excel
all these lead to formation of social groups that are based on our choices
overlapping overlapping social differences create possibilities of deep social divisions and tensions
in overlapping one kind of social difference becomes more important than the other and the people start feeling that they belong to a different community
for example in northern ireland class and religion overlap each other
catholics and protestants have had conflicts in northern ireland
cross-cutting cross-cutting social differences are easier to accommodate
in cross-cutting groups that share a common interest on one issue are sometimes on different sides on different issues
for example in netherlands class and religion tend to cut across each other
catholics and protestants are about equally likely to be poor or rich
there are no conflicts in the netherlands
factors determining the outcome of politics of social divisions are  how people perceive their identities
if people see their identities in exclusive terms it becomes difficult to accommodate
as long as people in northern ireland saw themselves as only catholic or protestant their differences were difficult to reconcile
it is easier if identities are complimentary with national identity
this helps to stay together
 how political leaders raise demands of any community
it is easier to accommodate demands that are within the constitutional framework and are not at the cost of another community
the demand for ‘only sinhala’ was at the cost of the interest and identity of the tamil community in sri lanka
 how government reacts to demands of different groups
if the rulers are willing to share power and accommodate the reasonable demands of minority community as in belgium social divisions become less threatening for the country
but if the demand is suppressed in the name of national unity as in sri lanka the end result is quite opposite
such attempts at forced integration sow the seeds of disintegration
feminist movements are radical women’s movements aiming at attaining equality for women in personal and family life and public affairs
patriarchal society a patriarchal society is essentially male dominated
the line of descent is traced through the father
men are valued more in terms of work they do and the place they hold in society
this gives them more power than women
communal politics when the demands of one religious group are formed in opposition to another and when state power is used to establish domination of one religious group over the rest this manner of using religion in politics is called communal politics
a smaller proportion of girls gp for higher studies
 on an average a woman works more than an average man everyday
since much of her work is not paid for therefore often not valued
 the equal wages act provides for equal wages for equal work
but in almost all areas of work from sports to cinema from factories to fields women are comparatively paid less
 the child sex ratio number of girl children per thousand boys is very low
in india the national average is 
in some places it is as low as  or even  because parents prefer to have sons so they get the girl child aborted before her birth
 in urban areas women are unsafe
even in their homes they suffer from beating harassment and other forms of domestic violence
caste inequalities in india caste has not disappeared from contemporary india and caste division is special to india
even now most people marry within their own caste
the caste groups that had access to education under old system have done well whereas those groups that did not have access to education have lagged behind
there is a large presence of ‘upper taste’ among the urban middle classes in our country
caste continues to be linked to economic status as is evident from national sample survey
the average economic status of caste groups still follows the old hierarchy—the ‘upper’ castes are best off the dalits and adivasis are worst off and the backward classes are in between
the upper castes are heavily over represented among the rich while the lower castes are under-represented
the sc st and obc together account for about two-thirds of india’s population
status of women’s representation in india’s legislative bodies the one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is to have more women as elected representatives
to achieve this it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies
 panchayati raj in india has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women
 in india the proportion of women in legislature has been very low
the percentage of elected women members in lok sabha is not even  per cent and in state assemblies less than  per cent
only recently in march  the women’s reservation bill was passed in the rajya sabha ensuring % reservation to women in parliament and state legislative bodies
religion and politics in india gandhiji said “religion can never be separated from politics”
by religion he did not mean any particular religion like hinduism or islam but moral values and ethics drawn from religion to guide politics
religion in politics is not as dangerous as it may seem to us
ethical values of each religion can play a major role in politics
government can take special steps to protect them
these instances show a relationship between religion and politics
people should be able to express in politics their needs interests and demands as members of a religious community
thus it is the responsibility of those whose political power is able to regulate the practice of religion to prevent discrimination and oppression
reasons which have contributed to changes in caste system  efforts of political leaders and social reformers like gandhiji b
ambedkar who advocated and worked to establish a society in which caste inequalities are absent
 socio-economic changes such as urbanization growth of literacy and education occupational mobility weakening of landlord’s position in the village breaking down of caste hierarchy have greatly contributed
 the constitution of india prohibited any caste-based discrimination
 provision of fundamental rights has played a major role because these rights are provided to all citizens without any discrimination
a party that secures atleast  per cent of the total votes in an election to the legislative assembly of a state and wins atleast two seats is recognized as a ‘state party’
tabulate four national parties and four regional parties of india
national parties indian national congress bjp bharatiya janta party cpi communist party of india cpi m communist party of india —marxist
regional parties akali dal punjab dmk tamil nadu rjd rashtriya janta dal bihar shiv sena maharashtra
partisanship a partisan is a person who is strongly committed to a party group or faction
as parties political are about a part of the society they involve ‘partisanship’
role of an opposition party opposition parties mobilize opposition to the government
it puts forward its own views in parliament and criticizes the government for its failures
by doing this it keeps a check on the ruling party
source of inspiration of bharatiya janata party the source of inspiration of bharatiya janata party is the ancient indian culture and values
cultural nationalism hindutva is an important element in its conception of indian nationhood and politics
source of inspiration of bahujan samaj party the bahujan samaj party draws inspiration from the ideas and teachings of sahu maharaj mahatma phule periyar ramaswami naicker and babasaheb ambedkar
it stands for the interest and welfare of the dalits and other oppressed people
ideology of indian national congress under the leadership of jawaharlal nehru the indian national congress sought to build a modem secular democratic republic in india
the party propagates secularism and welfare of the weaker sections and minorities of society
it supports new economic reforms but with a human face
there are three kinds of party systems as given below 
in some countries only one party is allowed to control and run the government
for example in china only the communist party is allowed to rule
in this system several parties may exist contest the elections and win a few seats in the national legislatures
but only two main parties have a serious chance of winning majority of seats to form government
for example the usa and the uk
in this system the government is formed by various parties coming together in a coalition
when several parties in a multi-party system join hands for the purpose of contesting elections and winning power it is called an alliance or a front
for example in india there were three major alliances in  parliamentary elections—the national democratic alliance nda the united progressive alliance upa and the left front
efforts to reform political parties are 
the constitution has been amended to prevent elected mlas and mps from changing parties
now if any elected mla or mp changes his party heshe will lose hisher seat in the legislative assembly or parliament
this amended law has helped to bring down the number of defections
the supreme court has passed an order to reduce the influence of money and criminals
now it has become mandatory for every candidate who contests election to file an affidavit giving details of his assets and criminal cases pending against him
this has helped in making this information available to the public
role of money and muscle power grows during elections since focus of the parties is on winning elections they use short-cuts to win the elections
they nominate candidates who have or can raise lot of money
in some cases parties support criminals who can win elections
thus the role of rich people and big companies in the democratic process has been a cause of worry
dynastic succession most political parties do not practice open and transparent procedures for their functioning
so there are very few ways for an ordinary worker to rise to the top in a party
those who happen to be the leaders are in a position of unfair advantage as they favor people close to them or even their family members
in many parties the top positions are always controlled by members of a particular family which is unfair to other members of the party and bad for democracy
functions of political party  contesting elections
political parties put forward different policies and programmes so that the voters can choose from them
the policies and programmes of the ruling party are expected to be followed by
political parties play a decisive role in making laws for the country
political parties form and run governments
the executive body is formed by people from the ruling party
a party which does not get majority or come under the majority coalition needs to play the role of opposition
political parties shape public opinion
they do so by raising and highlighting issues in the legislature and in the media
political parties provide people access to government machinery and welfare schemes implemented by governments
when possible and necessary citizens should be able to participate in decision-making in a democracy
democracy ensures that decision-making is based on norms and procedures
a citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making
for a democracy to produce an accountable responsive and legitimate government it must ensure the following— regular free and fair elections open public debate on major policies and legislation’s citizens’ right to be informed about government policies a government free from corruption
two conditions necessary for a democracy to achieve harmonious society democracy must fulfill the following two conditions in order to achieve a harmonious social life 
majority and minority opinions are not permanent
democracy is not simply rule by majority opinion
the majority needs to work with the minority so that government may function to represent the general view
rule by majority does not become rule by majority community in terms of religion or race or linguistic groups etc
democracy remains democracy so long as every citizen has a chance of being in majority at some point of time
no individual should be debarred from participating in a democracy on the basis of religion caste community creed and other such factors
outcomes of democracy there are certain things that democracy must provide
in a democracy people have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over them
whenever possible and necessary citizens should be able to participate in decision¬making that affects them all
it is right to expect democracy to produce a government that follows procedures and is accountable to people
democratic government develops mechanisms for citizens—regular free and fair elections open public debate on major policies and legislation’s and citizens’ right to information about the government and its functioning
democracy is a better form of government than others  based on the idea of deliberation and negotiation
thus the necessary delay in implementation
 a citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of- decision-making
 democratic government is legitimate government people’s own government
 there is inability of democracy to achieve higher economic growth which is a cause of worry
 ability to handle differences decisions and conflicts is a positive point of democratic regimes
 democracy has strengthened the claims of the disadvantaged and discriminated castes for equal status and equal opportunity
dignity and freedom of citizens are best guaranteed in a democracy 
the one way to ensure that women related problems get adequate attention is to have more women as elected representatives
to achieve this it is legally binding to have a fair proportion of women in the elected bodies
panchayati raj in india has reserved one-third seats in local government bodies for women
in march  the women’s reservation bill was passed in the rajya sabha ensuring % reservation for women in parliament and state legislative bodies
democracy has strengthened the claims of disadvantaged and discriminated castes
when governments are formed political parties usually take care that representatives of different castes and tribes find a place in it
some political parties are known to favour some castes
democracy provides for equal status and opportunities for all castes
democracy transforms people from the status of a subject into that of a citizen
a democracy ensures that people will have the right to choose their rulers and people will have control over the rulers
a citizen has the right and the means to examine the process of decision-making
there is transparency in a democracy like india
in october  the right to information rti law was passed which ensures all its citizens the right to get all the information about the functions of the government departments
political reform all the suggestions or proposals about overcoming various challenges to democracy are called democratic reforms or political reforms challenges faced by countries which do not have a democratic form of government 
these countries face the foundation challenge of making the transition to democracy and then instituting democratic government
they also face the challenge of bringing down the existing non-democratic regime and keeping the military away from controlling the government
such countries have to make great efforts to establish a sovereign and functional state
three challenges faced by democracy  foundation challenge
it relates to making the transition to democracy and then instituting democratic government
it involves bringing down the existing non-democratic regime keeping military away from controlling government and establishing a sovereign and functional state
it involves applying the basic principle of democratic government across all the regions different social groups and various institutions
it pertains to ensuring greater power to local governments extension of federal principle to all the units of the federation inclusion of women and minority groups etc
 india and us face the challenge of expansion
 challenge of deepening of democracy
this challenge involves strengthening of the institutions and practices of democracy
it means strengthening those institutions that help people’s participation and control in the government
it aims at bringing down the control and influence of rich and powerful people in making governmental decisions
broad guidelines for political reforms 
as legal-constitutional changes by themselves cannot overcome challenges to democracy democratic reforms need to be carried out mainly by political activists parties movements and politically conscious citizens
any legal change must carefully look at what results it will have on politics
generally laws that seek a ban on something are rather counter-productive for example many states have debarred people who have more than two children from contesting panchayat elections
this has resulted in denial of democratic opportunity to many poor women which was not intended
the best laws are those which empower people to carry out democratic reforms for example the right to information act which acts as a watchdog of democracy by controlling corruption
democratic reforms are to be brought about principally through political parties
the most important concern should be to increase and improve the quality of political participation by ordinary citizens
any proposal for political reforms should think not only about what is a good solution but also about who will implement it and how
