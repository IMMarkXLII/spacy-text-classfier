in his name this country was named as bharat
according to some scholars bharat name was given according to a caste living in india in ancient times
the name ‘india’ was originated from indus valley civilization
huns egyptians persians and other countrymen used to enter india by crossing indus river
the word hindu originated from sindhu
people from these countries used to pronounce s as h and so they called sindhu as hindu
egyptians and romans used to call indus as sindhu valley and eastern part of it as india
india’s boundaries are clear from geographical point of viewt
there are great mountains on its north-east and north-west side and there are great ocean in its south-east and south-west sides
foreigners can enter india by crossing khyber and bolan straits
among all the living civilisation of the world india is probably the oldest
around - bc a group of food gatherers developed a highly developed civilization
with the destruction of harappa civilization a new civilization took birth in india
in  bc aryans came to india which gave birth to vedic culture
according to historians aryans had not come from some other place
they were divided in many castes
they kept roaming in persia in west ganga valley in the east and regions of caspian sea
by  bc aryans reached to the southern comer of india to tie india in a cultural knot
according to aryans the society was divided into four vama brahmin kshatriya vaishya and shudra
study of ved prayers etc were the responsibility of brahmins
saving people from enemies was the responsibility of kshatriyas
vaishyas used to take care of business activities and economy of the nation
shudra used to provide labour for different tasks
it was occupational classification on the basis of activity

it is the second most populous country after china in the world with a population of 
the mainland of india extends from kashmir in the north to kanniyakumari in the south and arunachal pradesh in the east to gujarat in the west
india extends from territorial limit further extends towards the sea upto  nautical miles about 
 km from the coast
india lies entirely in the northern hemisphere
the mainland extends between latitudes °′ n kanniyakumari cape caverian and ° ′ n indira col jammu and kashmir and longitudes ° ′ e dwarka gujarat and ° ′ e sadiya arimachal pradesh
longitudinal extent of india is ° ′ to ° ′ e-°
the latitudinal and longitudinal extent of india are roughly about  degrees whereas the actual distance measured from north to south extremity is  km and that from east to west is only  km
this difference is based on the fact that the distance between two longitudes decreases towards the poles whereas the distance between two latitudes remains the same everywhere
the southern part of the country lies within the tropics and the northern part lies in the sub¬tropical zone or the warm temperate zone
this location is responsible for large variations in landforms climate soil types and natural vegetation in the country
there is a variation of nearly  degrees from west to east in india which causes a time difference of nearly two hours between the easternmost and the westernmost parts of our country
that is why °′ e has been selected as the ‘standard meridian’ of india
indian standard time is ahead of greenwich mean time by  hours and  minutes
there are some countries where there are more than one standard meridian due to their vast east-to-west extent
for example the usa has seven time zones
the size of india has endowed her with great physical diversity
india is gifted with the presence of lofty mountains in the north large rivers such as ganga brahmaputra mahanadi krishna godavari and kaveri green forested hills in northeast and south india and the vast sandy expanse of marusthali
india has second position in terms of agrarian land after usa
it is bounded by the himalayas in the north hindukush and sulaiman ranges in the north-west purvachal hills in the north-east and by the large expanse of the indian ocean in the south it forms a great geographic entity known as the indian subcontinent
it includes the countries — pakistan nepal bhutan bangladesh and india
india’s land length is  km and it has a coastline of  km in the mainland and  km in the entire geographical coast of the mainland plus the island groups andaman and nicobar located in the bay of bengal and the lakshadweep in the arabian sea
thus india as a country is a physically diverse land providing occurrence of varied resources
india is located in the south-central part of the continent of asia bordering the indian ocean and its two arms extending in the form of bay of bengal and the arabian sea
this maritime location of peninsular india has provided links to its neighbouring regions through the sea and air routes
sri lanka and maldives are the two island countries located in the indian ocean which are our neighbours
sri lanka is separated from india by the gulf of mannar and palk strait
india has  states and  union territories
it is situated in the middle of western asia and eastern asia

the northern boundary of the peninsular block may be taken as an irregular line running from kachchh along the western flank of the aravali range near delhi and then roughly parallel to the yamuna and the ganga as far as the rajmahai hills and the ganga delta
apart from these the karbi anglong and the meghalaya plateau in the north-east and rajasthan in the west are also extensions of this block
the rift valleys of the narmada the tapi and the mahanadi and the satpura block mountains are some examples of it
the peninsula mostly consists of relict and residual mountains like the aravali hills the nallamala hills the javadi hills the veliconda hills the palkonda range and the mahendragiri hills etc
most of the east flowing rivers form deltas before entering into the bay of bengal
the deltas formed by the mahanadi the krishna the kaveri and the godavari are important examples
the himalayas along with other peninsular mountains are young weak and flexible in their geological structure unlike the rigid and stable peninsular block
consequently they are still subjected to the interplay of exogenic and endogenic forces resulting in the development of faults folds and thrust plains
the third geological division of india comprises the plains formed by the river indus the ganga and the brahmaputra
originally it was a geo-synclinal depression which attained its maximum development during the third phase of the himalayan mountain formation approximately about  million years ago
since then it has been gradually filled by the sediments brought by the himalayan and peninsular rivers
average depth of alluvial deposits in these plains ranges from - m
india can be divided into the following physio-graphic divisions  the northern and north-eastern mountains  the northern plain  the peninsular plateau  the indian desert  the coastal plains  the islands
the north and north-eastern mountains consist of the himalayas and the north-eastern hills
the himalayas consist of a series of parallel mountain ranges
the approximate length of the great himalayan range also known as the central axial range is  km from east to west and their width varies between - km from north to south
on the basis of relief alignment of ranges and other geomorphological features the himalayas can be divided into the following sub-divisions  kashmir or north-western himalayas
 himachal and uttaranchal himalayas
 darjeeling and sikkim himalayas
 eastern hills and mountains
kashmir or north-western himalayas comprise a series of ranges such as the karakoram ladakh zaskar and pir panjal
the north-eastern part of the kashmir himalayas is a cold desert which lies between the greater himalayas and the karakoram ranges
the word shiwalik has its origin in the geological formation found in and around a place called sivawala near dehra dun which was once a headquarter of the imperial survey and which subsequently established its permanent headquarters at dehra dun
the himachal and uttarakhand himalayas lies approximately between the ravi in the west and the kali a tributary of ghaghara in the east
in this section of lesser himalayas the altitude between - m specially attracted to the british colonial administration and subsequently some of the important hill stations such as dharamshala mussoorie shimla kaosani and the cantonment towns and health resorts such as shimla mussoorie kasauli almora lansdowne and ranikhet etc
were developed in this region
in the great himalayan range the valleys are mostly inhabited by the bhotia’s
these are nomadic groups who migrate to ‘bugyals’ the summer glass lands in the higher reaches during summer months and return to the valleys during winters
the famous ‘valley of flowers’ is also situated in this region
the places of pilgrimage such as the gangotri yamunotri kedarnath badrinath and hemkund sahib are also situated in this part
sikkim and darjeeling himalayas are also known for their scenic beauty and rich flora and fauna particularly various types of orchids
an important aspect of the arunachal himalayas is the numerous ethnic tribal community inhabiting in these areas
some of the prominent ones from west to east are the monpa daffla abor mishmi nishi and the nagas
most of these communities practise jhumming
it is also known as shifting or slash and burn cultivation
this region is rich in biodiversity which has been preserved by the indigenous communities
due to rugged topography the inter-valley transportation linkages are nominal
hence most of the interactions are carried through the duar region along the arunachal-assam border
the eastern hills and mountains are having their general alignment from the north to the south direction
they are known by different local names
in the north they are known as patkai bum naga hills the manipur hills and in the south as mizo or lushai hills
these are low hills inhabited by numerous tribal groups practising jhum cultivation
the northern plains are formed by the alluvial deposits broiight by the rivers – the indus the ganga and the brahmaputra
these plains extend approximately  km from the east to the west
the average width of these plains varies between - km
the maximum depth of alluvium deposits varies between - m
from the north to the south these can be divided into three major zones the bhabar the tarai and the alluvial plains
the alluvial plains can be further divided into the khadar and the bhangar
bhabar is a narrow belt ranging between - km parallel to the shiwalik foothills at the break-up of the slope
south of the bhabar is the tarai belt with an approximate width of - km where most of the streams and rivers re- emerge without having any properly demarcated channel thereby creating marshy and swampy conditions known as the tarai
northern plains is a featureless plain with a general elevation of - m above the mean sea level
the states of haryana and delhi form a water divide between the indus and the ganga river systems
rising from the height of  m above the river plains up to an elevation of - m is the irregular triangle known as the peninsular plateau
delhi ridge in the northwest extension of aravalis the rajmahal hills in the east gir range in the west and the cardamom hills in the south constitute the outer extent of the peninsular plateau
however an extension of this is also seen in the northeast in the form of shillong and karbi-anglong plateau
the peninsular india is made up of a series of patland plateaus such as the hazaribagh plateau the palamu plateau the ranchi plateau the malwa plateau the coimbatore plateau and the karnataka plateau etc
on the basis of the prominent relief features the peninsular plateau can be divided into three broad groups  the deccan plateau  the central highlands  the north-eastern plateau
the deccan plateau is bordered by the western ghats in the west eastern ghats in the east and the satpura maikal range and mahadeo hills in the north
western ghats are locally known by different names such as sahyadri in maharashtra nilgiri hills in karnataka and tamil nadu and anaimalai hills and cardamom hills in kerala
western ghats are comparatively higher in elevation and more continuous than the eastern ghats
their average elevation is about  m with the height increasing from north to south
‘anaimudi  m the highest peak of peninsular plateau is located on the anaimalai hills of the western ghats followed by dodabetta  m on the nilgiri hills
some of the important ranges in eastern ghats include the javadi hills the palconda
range the nallamala hills the mahendragiri hills etc
an extension of this is also seen in the karbi anglong hills of assam
to the north-west of the aravali hills lies the great indian desert
it is a land of undulating topography dotted with longitudinal dunes and barchans
this region receives low rainfall below  mm per year hence it has arid climate with low vegetation cover
on the basis of the location and active geomorphological processes it can be broadly divided into two  the western coastal plains  the eastern coastal plains
there are two major island groups in india – one in the bay of bengal and the other in the arabian sea
the bay of bengal island groups consist of about  islandsislets
these are situated roughly between °n-°n and °e -°e
the two principal groups of islets include the ritchie’s archipelago and the labrynth island
some important mountain peaks in andaman and nicobar islands are saddle peak north andaman –  m mount diavolo middle andaman –  m mount koyob south andaman –  m and mount thuiller great nicobar –  m
these islands are located at a distance of  km- km off the kerala coast
is built of coral deposits
there are approximately  islands of which  are inhabited
minicoy is the largest island with an area of  sq

nearly  per cent of the drainage area consisting of the ganga the brahmaputra the mahanadi the krishna etc
on the basis of the size of the watershed the drainage basins of india are grouped into three categories  major river basins with more than  sq
it includes  drainage basins such as the ganga the brahmaputra the krishna the tapi the narmada the mahi the penner the sabarmati the barak etc
 medium river basins with catchment area between - sq
km incorporating  river basins such as the kalindi the periyar the meghna etc
minor river basins with catchment area of less than  sq
km include fairly good number of rivers flowing in the area of low rainfall
the indus system is one of the largest river basins of the world covering an area of  sq
km in india it is   sq
km and a total length of  km and in india its length is  km
the jhelum an important tributary of the indus rises from a spring at verinag situated at the foot of the pir panjal in the south-eastern part of the valley of kashmir
it joins the chenab near jhang in pakistan
the chenab is the largest tributary of the indus
it is formed by two streams the chandra and the bhaga which join at tandi near keylong in himachal pradesh
hence it is also known as chandrabhaga
the ravi is another important tributary of the indus
it rises west of the rohtang pass in the kullu hills of himachal pradesh and flows through the chamba valley of the state
the beas is another important tributary of the indus originating from the beas kund near the rohtang pass at an elevation of  m above the mean sea level
it passes through the shipki la on the himalayan ranges and enters the punjab plains
it is an antecedent river
it is a very important tributary as it feeds the canal system of the bhakra nangal project
the ganga system rises in the gangotri glacier near gaumukh  m in the uttarkashi district of uttarakhand
here it is known as the bhagirathi
at devprayag the bhagirathi meets the alaknanda hereafter it is known as the ganga
the alaknanda has its source in the satopanth glacier above badrinath
the alaknanda consists of the dhauli and the vishnu ganga which meet at joshimath or vishnu prayag
the other tributaries of alaknanda such as the pindar joins it at kama prayag while mandakini or kali ganga meets it at rudra prayag
the ganga river has a length of  km
it is shared by uttarakhand  km and uttar pradesh  km bihar  km and west bengal  km
the ganga basin covers about 
km area in india alone
the ganga river system is the largest in india having a number of perennial and non- perennial rivers originating in the himalayas in the north and the peninsula in the south respectively
the son is its major right bank tributary
the important left bank tributaries are the ramganga the gomati the ghaghara the gandak the kosi and the mahananda
the yamuna is the western most and the longest tributary of the ganga
it has its source in the yamunotri glacier on the western slopes of banderpunch range  km
it joins the ganga at prayag in allahabad
join it on its left bank
from kota it traverses down to bundi sawai madhopur and dholpur and finally joins the yamuna
the gandak comprises two streams namely kaligandak and trishulganga

the brahmaputra is one of the largest rivers of the world
it has its origin in the chemayungdung glacier of the kailash range near the mansarovar lake
the brahmaputra receives numerous tributaries in its  km long journey through the assam valley
its major left bank tributaries are the burhi dihing and dhansari south whereas the important right bank tributaries are the subansiri kameng manas and sankosh
the subansiri which has its origin in tibet is an antecedent river
the peninsular drainage system is older than the himalayan one
this is evident from the broad largely-graded shallow valleys and the maturity of the rivers
most of the major peninsular rivers except narmada and tapi flow from west to east
the chambal the sind the betwa the ken the son originating in the northern part of the peninsula belong to the ganga river system
the other major river systems of the peninsular drainage are – the mahanadi the godavari the krishna and the kaveri
peninsular rivers are characterised by fixed course absence of meanders and non- perennial flow of water
 upheaval of the himalayas when the northern flank of the peninsular block was subjected to subsidence and the consequent trough faulting
 slight tilting of the peninsular block from north-west to the south- eastern direction gave orientation to the entire drainage system towards the bay of bengal during the same period
there are some problems in river water usage
some of these are  no availability in sufficient quantity
 load of silt in the river water
 uneven seasonal flow of water
 river water disputes between states
 shrinking of channels due to the extension of settlements towards the thalweg
important terms  drainage the flow of water through well-defined channels is known as ‘drainage
’  drainage system the network of drainage channels is called a ‘drainage system’
 dendritic drainage system the drainage pattern resembling the branches of a tree is known as “dendritic” the examples of which are the rivers of northern plain
 radial drainage system when the rivers originate from a hill and flow in all directions the drainage pattern is known as ‘radial’
the rivers originating from the amarkantak range present a good example of it
 trellis when the primary tributaries of rivers flow parallel to each other and secondary tributaries join them at right angles the pattern is known as ‘trellis’
 catchment area a river drains the water collected from a specific area which is called its ‘catchment area’
 drainage basin an area drained by a river and its tributaries is called a drainage basin
 watershed the boundary line separating one drainage basin from the other is known as the watershed

 river system a river or a river system is a body of water flowing in a channel through the surface of the earth
it consists of four important parts river course river source tributaries and river mouth
 river source a place at which begins or originates
this is usually found in mountainous areas
the source may be melting snow from the top of a mountain on a lake with stream flowing out of it
a river flow downhill from its source due to the force of gravity  river course the path on which the river flows along
 singi khamban or lion’s mouth kailash mountain range is known as ‘singi khamban or lion’s mouth in tibet

 cumecs it stands for cubic metres per second
weather changes quickly may be within a day or week but climate changes imperceptively and may be noted after  years or even more
india has hot monsoonal climate which is the prevalent climate in south and south-east asia
while in the summer the mercury occasionally touches °c in the western rajasthan it drops down to as low as minus °c in winter around leh
churu in rajasthan may record a temperature of °c or more on a june day while the mercury hardly touches °c in tawang arunachal pradesh on the same day
on a december night temperature in drass jammu and kashmir may drop down to minus °c while thiruvananthapuram or chennai on the same night records °c or °c
in kerala and in the andaman islands the difference between day and night temperatures may be hardly seven or eight degree celsius
but in the thar desert if the day temperature is around °c at night it may drop down considerably upto °-°c
while snowfall occurs in the himalayas it only rains over the rest of the country
similarly variations are noticeable not only in the type of precipitation but also in its amount
while cherrapunji and mawsynram in the khasi hills of meghalaya receive rainfall over  cm in a year jaisalmer in rajasthan rarely gets more than  cm of rainfall during the same period
tura situated in the garo hills of meghalaya may receive an amount of rainfall in a single day which is equal to  years of rainfall at jaisalmer
the ganga delta and the coastal plains of orissa are hit by strong rain-bearing storms almost every third or fifth day in july and august while the coromandal coast a thousand km to the south goes generally dry during these months
most parts of the country get rainfall during june-september but on the coastal areas of tamil nadu it rains in the beginning of the winter season
in spite of these differences and variations the climate of india is monsoonal in rhythm and character
with a long coastline large coastal areas have an equable climate
areas in the interior of india are far away from the moderating influence of the sea
such areas have extremes of climate
due to thin air places in the mountains are cooler than places on the plains
with increase in height by  metres temperature decreases by one degree celcius
agra and darjiling are located on the same latitude but temperature of january in agra is °c whereas it is only °c in darjiling
an easterly jet stream flows over the southern part of the peninsula in june and has a maximum speed of  km per hour
in august it is confined to °n latitude and in september up to °n latitudes
the easterlies normally do not extend to the north of °n latitude in the upper atmosphere
the monsoon may burst in the first week of june in the coastal areas of kerala karnataka goa and maharashtra while in the interior parts of the country it may be delayed to the first week of july
the day temperature registers a decline of °c to °c between mid- june and mid-july
the mean daily temperature remains below °c over most parts of northern india
the night temperature may be quite low sometimes going below freezing point in punjab and rajasthan
the mean maximum temperature for january at thiruvananthapuram is as high as °c and for june it is 
temperatures at the hills of western ghats remain comparatively low
april may and june are the months of summer in north india
in most parts of india temperatures recorded are between °-°c
the average annual rainfall in india is about  cm but it has great spatial variations
the highest rainfall occurs along the west coast on the western ghats as well as in the sub-himalayan areas in the north-east and the hills of meghalaya
here the rainfall exceeds  cm
in some parts of khasi and jaintia hills the rainfall exceeds  cm
in the brahmaputra valley and the adjoining hills the rainfall is less then  cm
rainfall between - cm is received in the southern parts of gujarat east tamil nadu north-eastern peninsula covering odisha jharkhand bihar eastern madhya pradesh northern ganga plain along the sub-himalayas and the cachar valley and manipur
areas of low rainfall western uttar pradesh delhi haryana punjab jammu and kashmir eastern rajasthan gujarat and deccan plateau receive rainfall between - cm
areas of inadequate rainfall parts of the peninsula especially in andhra pradesh karnataka and maharashtra ladakh and most of western rajasthan receive rainfall below  cm
snowfall is restricted to the himalayan region
the mean annual surface temperature of the earth in the past  years has increased
it is projected that by the year  global temperature will increase by about °c
this rise in temperature will cause many other changes one of these is a rise in sea level as a result of melting of glaciers and sea-ice due to warming

they are highly developed in the andaman and nicobar islands and the sunderbans of west bengal
other areas of significance are the mahanadi the godavari and the krishna deltas
these forests too are being encroached upon and hence need conservation
according to state records the forest area covers

these are urban forestry rural forestry and farm forestry
urban forestry pertains to the raising and management of trees on public and privately owned lands in and around urban centres such as green belts parks roadside avenues industrial and commercial green belts etc
rural forestry lays emphasis on promotion of agro-forestry and community- forestry
it combines forestry with agriculture thus altering the simultaneous production of food fodder fuel timber and fruits
in  a comprehensive wildlife act was enacted which provides the main legal framework for conservation and protection of wildlife in india
now there are  national parks and  wildlife sanctuaries covering an area of about 
 million hectares in the country
special schemes like project tiger and project elephant have been launched to conserve these species and their habitat in a sustainable manner
project elephant has been implemented since 
under project tiger launched on  april   tiger reserves have been set up in  states covering an area of about  sq
there are  biosphere reserves in india
nine of them are recognized by unesco
they are   nilgiri  nanda devi  sunderbans  gulf of mannar  great nicobar  pachmarhi  amarkantak  norkek  simlipal
out of a total of  districts  have been identified as tribal districts
the tribal districts account for about 
 per cent of the total forest cover of the country whereas the geographical area of  tribal districts forms only 
 per cent of the total geographical area of the country
 planted vegetation it refers to planting of trees under human supervision
 international convention an international convention is an agreement among member states of the united nations
 forest area the forest area is the area notified and recorded as the forest land irrespective of the existence of trees
it is based on the records of the state revenue department
 actual forest cover the actual forest cover is the area occupied by forests with canopy
it is based on aerial photographs and satellite imageries
 social forestry social forestry means the management and protection of forests and afforestation on barren lands with the purpose of helping in the environmental social and rural development
 community forestry it involves the raising of trees on public or community land such as the village pasture and temple land roadside canal bank strips along railway lines and schools etc
 rural forestry it lays emphasis on promotion of agro-forestry and community-forestry
agro-forestry is the raising of trees and agriculture crops on the same land inclusive of the waste patches
 biosphere reserve a biosphere reserve is a unique and representative ecosystem of terrestrial and coastal areas which are internationally recognised within the framework of unesco’s man and biosphere mab programme
 national park a national park is an area which is strictly reserved for the protection of the wildlife and where activities such as forestry grazing or cultivation are not allowed
in protected forests all activities are prohibited unless permitted
 protected forest an area notified under the provisions of indian forest act or the state forest acts having limited degree of protection
in protected forests all activities are permitted unless prohibited
 sanctuary a sanctuary is an area which is reserved for the conservation of animals only and operations such as harvesting of timber collection of minor forest products are allowed so long as they do not affect the animals adversely
 unclassed forest an area recorded as forest but not included in reserved or protected forest category
ownership status of such forests varies from state to state
 conservation the protection of natural environment and natural resources for the future is called conservation
it includes the management of minerals landscape soil and forests to prevent their destruction and over exploitation
the major factors affecting the formation of soil are relief parent material climate vegetation and other life-forms and time
besides these human activities also influence it to a large extent
components of the soil are mineral particles humus water and air
the actual amount of each of these depends upon the type of soil
soil is bifurcated into three layers called horizons
‘horizon b’ is a transition zone between the ‘horizon a’ and ‘horizon c’ and contains matter derived from below as well as from above
this layer is the first stage in the soil formation process and eventually forms the above two layers
in ancient times soils used to be classified into twro main groups – urvara and usara which were fertile and sterile respectively
in the th century a
 soils were classified on the basis of their inherent characteristics and external features such as texture colour slope of land and moisture content in the soil
based on texture main soil types were identified as sandy clayey silty and loamy etc
on the basis of colour they wrere red yellow black etc
on the basis of genesis colour composition and location the soils of india have been classified into  alluvial soils  black soils  red and yellow soils  laterite soils  arid soils  saline soils  peaty soils  forest soils
alluvial soils are widespread in the northern plains and the river valleys
these soils cover about  per cent of the total area of the country
they are depositional soils transported and deposited by rivers and streams
the alluvial soils vary in nature from sandy loam to clay
they are generally rich in potash but poor in phosphorous
in the upper and middle ganga plain two different types of alluvial soils have developed viz
khadar is the new alluvium and is deposited by floods annually which enriches the soil by depositing fine silts
bhangar represents a system of older alluvium deposited away from the flood plains
andhra pradesh and some parts of tamil nadu
in the upper reaches of the godavari and the krishna and the north western part of the deccan plateau the black soil is very deep
red soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern part of the deccan plateau
along the piedmont zone of the western ghat long stretch of area is occupied by red loamy soil
laterite has been derived from the latin word ‘later’ which means brick
the laterite soils develop in areas with high temperature and high rainfall
these are the result of intense leaching due to tropical rains
with rain lime and silica are leached away and soils rich in iron oxide and aluminium compound are left behind
arid soils range from red to brown in colour
they are generally sandy in structure and saline in nature
in some areas the salt content is so high that common salt is obtained by evaporating the saline water
due to the dry climate high temperature and accelerated evaporation they lack moisture and humus
saline soils are also known as usara soils
saline soils contain a larger proportion of sodium potassium and magnesium and thus they are infertile and do not support any vegetative growth
they have more salts largely because of dry climate and poor drainage
they occur in arid and semi-arid regions and in waterlogged and swampy areas
peaty soils are found in the areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity where there is a good growth of vegetation
forest soils are formed in the forest areas where sufficient rainfall is available
the soils vary in structure and texture depending on the mountain environment where they are formed
they are loamy and silty on valley sides and coarse-grained in the upper slopes
soil degradation can be defined as the decline in soil fertility when the nutritional status declines and depth of the soil goes down due to erosion and misuse
the degree of soil degradation varies from place to place according to the topography wind velocity and amount of the rainfall
the destruction of the soil cover is described as soil erosion
forest and other natural vegetation are removed for human settlement for cultivation for grazing animals and for various other needs
wind and water are powerful agents of soil erosion because of their ability to remove soil and transport it
soil erosion is a serious problem for indian agriculture and its negative eff ects are seen in other spheres also
eroded materials are carried down to rivers and they lower down their carrying capacity and cause frequent floods and damage to agricultural lands
deforestation is one of the major causes of soil erosion
plants keep soils bound in locks of roots and thus prevent erosion
they also add humus to the soil by shedding leaves and twigs
the salt lodged in the lower profiles of the soil comes up to the surface and destroys its fertility
if soil erosion and exhaustion are caused by humans by corollary they can also be prevented by humans
contour bunding contour terracing regulated forestry controlled grazing cover cropping mixed farming and crop rotation are some of the remedial measures which are often adopted to reduce soil erosion
experiments have been made to stabilize sand dunes in western rajasthan by the central arid zone research institute cazri
the central soil conservation board set up by the government of india has prepared a number of plans for soil conservation in different parts of the country
 bad land topography a region with a large number of deep gullies or ravines is called a bad land topography
 horizons when we dig a pit on land and look at the soil we find that it consists of three layers
 horizon b it is a transition zone between the ‘horizon a’ and ‘horizon c’ and contains matter derived from below as well as from above
 horizon c it is composed of the loose parent material
this layer is the first stage in the soil formation process and eventually forms the above two layers
 soil profile the arrangement of layers in three horizons a b and c is known as the soil profile
 parent rock underneath the three horizons there is the rock which is known as the parent rock or the bedrock
 gully erosion it is the erosion of the soil and rock by the concentration of runoff into gullies
 khadar khadar is the new alluvium and is deposited by floods annually which enriches the soil by depositing fine silts
 bhangar bhangar represents a system of older alluvium deposited away from the flood plains
 alluvial soil they are depositional soils transported and deposited by rivers and streams
 laterite soil laterite has been derived from the latin word ‘later’ which means brick
the laterite soils develop in areas with high temperature and high rainfall
 black soil these soils are made from volcanoes
these soils are also known as the ‘regursoil’ or the ‘black cotton soil’
 forest soils forest soils are formed in the forest areas where sufficient rainfall is available
 peaty soils they are found in the areas of heavy rainfall and high humidity where there is a good growth of vegetation
 soil erosion the destruction of the soil cover is described as soil erosion
 soil degradation soil degradation can be defined as the decline in soil fertility when the nutritional status declines and depth of the soil goes down due to erosion and misuse
soil degradation is the main factor leading to the depleting soil resource base in india
 soil conservation soil conservation is a methodology to maintain soil fertility prevent soil erosion and exhaustion and improve the degraded condition of the soil
change is the law of nature
it is a process present everywhere with variations in terms of magnitude intensity and scale
change can be as sudden and swift as volcanic eruptions tsunamis earthquakes and lightening etc
disasters are also caused by some human activities
there are some activities carried by human beings that are directly responsible for disasters
bhopal gas tragedy chernobyl nuclear disaster wars release of cfcs chlorofluorocarbons and increase of green house gases environmental pollutions like noise air water and soil are some of the examples
establishment of national institute of disaster management india earth summit at rio de janeiro brazil  and the world conference on disaster management in may  at yokohama japan etc
are some of the concrete steps towards disaster management initiated at different levels
disaster management issue was raised at the u
general assembly in  and it was finally formalised at the world conference on disaster management in may  at yokohama japan
this was subsequently called the yokohama strategy and plan of action for a safer world
cyclones originate between °-° north latitudes during the monsoon season
in bay of bengal cyclones mostly develop during the months of october and november
here they originate between °-° n latitudes and to the west of ° e
by july the place of origin of these storms shifts to around ° n latitude and west of °e near the sunderban delta
floods occur commonly when water in the form of surface run-off exceeds the carrying capacity of the river channels and streams and flows into the neighbouring low-lying flood plains
rashtriya barh ayog national flood commission identified  million hectares of land as flood-prone in india
according to some estimates nearly  per cent of the total geographical area of the country and  per cent of its total population suffer due to drought every year
about  per cent of the country’s total area is identified as drought prone affecting around  million people
 natural hazards natural hazards are elements of circumstances in the natural environment that have the potential to cause harm to people or property or both
 drought the term ‘drought’ is applied to an extended period when there is a shortage of water availability due to inadequate precipitation excessive rate of evaporation and over¬utilisation of water from the reservoirs and other storages including the ground water
 landslide a form of mass movement in which rock and debris moves rapidly downslope under the influence of gravity as a result of failure along a shear plane
 flood when a river bursts its banks and the water spills out onto the floodplain it is called flood
 meteorological drought when there is a prolonged period of inadequate rainfall marked with mal-distribution of the same over time and space it is called meterological drought
 agricultural drought when there is by low soil moisture that is necessary to support the crops thereby resulting in crop failures it is called agricultural drought
 a tropical cyclone or hurricane it is like a heat engine that is energised by the release of latent heat on account of the condensation of moisture that the wind gathers after moving over the oceans and seas
 hydrological drought it results when the availability of water in different storages and reservoirs like aquifers lakes reservoirs etc
falls below what the precipitation can replenish
 ecological drought when the productivity of a natural ecosystem fails due to shortage of water and as a consequence of ecological distress damages are induced in the ecosystem
it is called ecological drought
 eye of the storm the centre of the cyclone is mostly a warm and low- pressure cloudless core
it is known as eye of the storm
 storm surge abnormal rise in the sea level is known as storm surge
 famine extreme scarcity of food as a result of drought is called famine
 earthquake an earthquake also known as a quake tremor or temblor is the result of a sudden release of energy in the earth’s crust that creates seismic waves
 seismicity the seismicity seismism or seismic activity of an area refers to the frequency type and size of earthquakes experienced over a period of time
the sun  the sun is in the center of the solar system
 it is made up of extremely hot gases
 the sun is about  million km away from the earth
planets  there are nine planets in our solar system
 the nine planets are mercury venus earth mars jupiter uranus neptune and pluto
 planets move around the sun in a fixed orbit
 mercury is the nearest planet
 pluto is the farthest planet
 a new planet  ub has been discovered
it is bigger than pluto and is farthest from the sun
earth  it is the third nearest planet to the sun and fifth largest planet of our solar system
 the earth is a unique planet because it supports life
 it is also called the blue planet
 its shape is geoid
the moon  it is the only satellite of the earth
‘  it is about 
 km away from us
 it moves around the earth in about  days
 only one side of the moon is visible to us on the earth
 no life exists on moon as it has neither water nor air
asteroids  they are numerous tiny bodies which move around the sun between the orbits of mars and jupiter
 the largest asteroid is the ceres
meteoroids  the small pieces of rocks which move around the sun are called meteoroids
 our solar system is a part of the milky way galaxy
 milky way galaxy was named akash ganga
 there are millions of galaxies that make the universe
the stars and the moon are celestial bodies which are visible only at night in the sky
during daytime the power of the sun’s light renders them invisible
the moon appears differently on different nights—like the full moon only once a month on the poornima night whereas on the fifteenth night after that there is no moon in the sky amavasya
some celestial bodies are big and hot since they are made of gases
the sun is also a star
we do not feel the heat and light of the stars other than the sun since they are very far away from us
groups of stars that are visible in definite patterns are called constellations
ursa major the big bear the small bear saptarishi etc are some well-known constellations
it is also called the north star since it helps in knowing the north direction
there are celestial bodies that do not have their own heat and light
they reflect the light they get from stars
such bodies are the planets
we live on the earth a planet
most planets have satellites which are celestial bodies that revolve around a particular planet
the moon is the only satellite of the earth
the earth and moon are part of a bigger system or family of celestial- bodies called the solar system
the sun is the “head” of this system and is present at its centre
the planets revolve around the sun while the satellite revolves around the placets
the planets in addition to revolving around the sun also rotate about their own axis
the sun is made of extremely hot gases and it provides heat and light to the rest of the solar system
it is about  million kilometres away from the earth
but it is now recognised as a “dwarf planet”
the shape of the earth is called a geoid
this means it is not perfectly spherical since it is flattened at the poles
the earth is probably the only planet that can support life
this is because its temperature resources like water and oxygen etc are present in the proportions appropriate for life
the earth with its  rd of surface covered with water appears blue from space and is called blue planet
the moon’s diameter is  th of that of the earth
it is  km away from earth
it completes a revolution around the earth in about  days
incidentally it also takes around the same time for a rotation about its own axis
it does not support life
there are several other tiny bodies in space the asteroids that move around the sun
there is a “belt” of such objects called the asteroid belt between mars and jupiter
there exist small pieces of rocks meteroids which also move around the sun
the milky way is the galaxy a huge system of billions of stars we live in
examples are sun earth moon stars etc
star a celestial body that is characterized by being very hot and big and made of gases is a star
a star typically has its own heat and light
full moon night a night when the moon is visible from the earth as a full sphere is called the full moon night and it occurs once a month
new moon night the fifteenth night after the full moon night when the moon is not visible at all in the sky is called the new moon night
constellation a group of several stars which can usually be recognized by a definite pattern is called a constellation
an example is ursa major
planets a celestial body which revolves around a particular star in an orbit and gets all its light from that star is called a planet
satellites a celestial body which revolves around a planet in a particular orbit is called a satellite
the moon is a satellite of the earth
sun the sun is a star that acts as the “head” of the solar system and around which all planets revolve note that the sun is not at the center of the orbit instead it is like in the figure above
inner planets the inner planets are the planets that orbit around the sun between the sun and the asteroid belt that is are close to the sun
these are mercury venus earth and mars
outer planets the outer planets are the planets that orbit the sun beyond the asteroid belt that is are very far away from the sun
these are jupiter saturn uranus and neptune
geoid the shape of the earth is called a geoid
a geoid is spherical except for the flattening at two places diametrically opposite to each other
poles the two places diametrically opposite to each other and which lie on the axis about which a spherical body rotates are called poles
meteoroid small pieces of rocks which move around the sun are called meteoroids
galaxy a galaxy is a collection of innumerable stars
most stars have their own families like the solar system
the milky way is the galaxy in which we live
universe the universe is the largest unit in which we live
it is a collection of galaxies
there is only one universe and everything that exists in this universe itself
a needle is fixed through the globe in a tilted manner which is called its axis
the imaginary line running on the globe divides it into equal parts
this line is known as the equator
all parallel circles from the equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitude
latitude is measured in degrees
as we move away from the equator the size of the parallels of latitude decreases
the four important parallels of latitude are   tropic of cancer  °n  tropic of capricorn  °s  arctic of circle  °n  antarctic circle  °s heat zones of the earth  torrid zone receives the maximum heat
 the temperate zone has a moderate temperature
 the frigid zone has a cold climate as the sun rays are always slanting
 the distance between them is measured in ‘degrees of longitude’
 all meridians are of equal length
 the meridian which passes through greenwich where the british royal observatory is located is called the prime meridian
 the value of prime meridian is ° longitude and from it we count ° eastward as well as ° westward
 prime meridian divides the earth into two equal halves the eastern hemisphere and the western hemisphere
 ° east and ° west meridians are on the same line
 we can locate any point on the globe if we know its latitude and longitude
longitude and time  as the earth rotates from west to east those places east of greenwich will be ahead of greenwich time and those to the west will be behind it
 the earth rotates ° in about  hours
 at any place a watch can be adjusted to read at  o’clock when the sun is at the highest point in the sky
standard time  the local time various places are different so it is necessary to adopt the local time of some central meridian of a country as the standard time
  °e is treated as the standard meridian of india
the local time at this meridian is known as the indian standard time ist
 india located east of greenwich at ° ’e is  hours and  minutes ahead of gmt
 some countries have a great longitudinal extent and so they have adopted more than one standard time
the globe is a true model of the earth in a small form
a needle called the axis is fixed through the globe in a tilted manner
this axis is shown in the form of a needle on the globe
the real earth has no such axis
the circle passing through the centre of the earth and perpendicular to the axis is called the equator
it divides the earth into two hemispheres the northern and the southern
we can imagine a number of more circles parallel to the equator having their centres on the axis and having different radii
these circles are called parallels of latitudes
the parallels are identified with the help of degrees
the equator represents the zero degrees latitude
the latitudes in the northern hemisphere are designated as degrees north °n e
°n °n and so on till °n which is the north pole
similarly the latitudes in the southern hemisphere are designated as degrees south °s and °s is the south pole
the circle passing through greenwich in britain and perpendicular to the equator and parallel to the axis is called the prime meridian
it divides the earth into two hemispheres the eastern and the western
together the equator and the prime meridian divide the earth into four equal parts
we can imagine a number of more circles parallel to the prime meridian having their centre at the centre of the earth and having equal radii
these circles are called degrees of longitudes
the longitudes are identified with the help of degrees
the prime meridian represents the zero degrees longitude
the longitudes in the eastern hemisphere are designated as degrees east °e e
°e °e and so on till °
similar is the case with the western hemisphere
degrees are further divided into minutes and minutes into seconds
note that the symbol for a minute is an apostrophe ‘ and that for a second is a double apostrophe “
′  minutes make up a degree and ″  seconds make up a minute
so ’ means half a degree and ” means two-thirds of a minute
also two distant points may lie on the same longitude
but only one point lief on a particular pair of latitude and longitude
so latitudes and longitudes are helpful in locating a point on earth
the tropic of cancer and the arctic circle are studied as special latitudes in the northern hemisphere
they are at  ° n and  ° n respectively
the tropic of capricorn and the antarctic circle are studied as special latitudes in the southern hemisphere
they are at  ° s and  ° s respectively
the area between the tropic of cancer and the tropic of capricorn receive maximum heat from the sun and this region is called the torrid zone
these regions are the temperate zones
the area north to the arctic circle and that south to the antarctic circle is close to the poles and receive the sunlight of very low intensity
so it is very cold here
these regions are called the frigid zones
the frigid zones the temperate zones and the torrid zone are called the heat zones
the sun does not shine equally on all longitudes at a time
when it is  noon at a time it means that the sun is not at all visible at the place on the other side of the earth
‘so it must be midnight there
in fact we can say that the time difference is  hours at  degrees longitudes apart
so every longitude brings a difference of  minutes
this gives us the concept of time zones
two consecutive time zones differ by an hour
the time at a particular place is said to be the local time
russia extends over eleven time zones
india actually extends over a range of a - hour time difference
but this is not too much so for convenience and for uniformity we have a standard meridian set at allahabad ° ’ which gives the time for all over india
this time is called the indian standard time ist
globe the globe is a model of the earth as it is but in a very small and convenient form
it shows all continents countries and oceans labeled
axis the imaginary line about which the earth rotates once in  hours is called its axis
poles the two extreme points of the axis are called the poles
one of them is the north pole and the other is the south pole
equator the circle passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the axis is called the equator
prime meridian the circle passing through greenwich in britain and perpendicular to the equator and parallel to the axis is called the prime meridian
latitude one of the imaginary circles parallel to the equator is called latitude
the latitudes have their centers on one common line and they have different radii
longitude one of the imaginary circles parallel to the prime meridian is called longitude
the longitudes have their centers at the center of the earth and have the same radius as the earth
hemisphere one of the two equal halves of the earth’s spherical shape is called a hemisphere
if the earth is halved along the equator we get the northern and the southern hemispheres
if we halve it perpendicular to the equator we get the eastern and the western hemispheres
these zones are called the torrid zone the two temperate zones and the two frigid zones
greenwich greenwich is a place in the united kingdom near london whose time is used as a standard all over the world
the prime meridian passes through this place and so it is the place which divides the earth into the eastern and the western hemispheres
standard time standard time of a country or region is the time regarded as a standard for that place despite the fact that there exists time difference geographically across that region
it is used only for convenience
 the axis of the earth which is an imaginary line makes an angle of ° with its orbital plane
 the portion facing the sun experiences day while the other half away from the sun experiences night
 the circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called the circle of illumination
 the earth takes about  hrs to complete one rotation around its axis it is known as earthday
revolution  the movement of the earth around the sun in a fixed path or orbit is called revolution
 earth takes  days to revolve around the sun
 every fourth year february is of  days instead of  days
such a year with  days is called a leap year
 earth is going around the sun in an elliptical-orbit
 seasons change due to change in the position of the earth around the sun
 summer solstice is the position of the earth when the northern hemisphere has the longest day and the shortest night
it  occurs on st june
 in the southern hemisphere it is winter season at this time
the days are short and the nights are long
 winter solstice is the position of the earth when southern hemisphere has long days and shorter nights
in the northern  hemisphere the days are short and the nights are long
it occurs on nd december
this is called an equinox
the earth has two types of motions—rotation and revolution
rotation is the movement of the earth on its axis
in revolution the earth moves around the sun in a fixed path or orbit
the axis of the earth is an imaginary line
the earth receives light from the sun
as the shape of the earth is spherical only half of it gets light from the sun at a time
the other half remains dark
in this way day and night are caused
the earth completes one rotation around its axis in about  hours
this rotation is the daily motion of the earth
the earth takes   days or one year to complete one revolution around the sun
there are four seasons in a year—summer winter spring and autumn
seasons change due to the change in the position of the earth around the sun
the rays of sun fall directly on the tropic of cancer
hence these areas are hot
• the areas near the poles receive less heat as the rays of the sun are slanting
in the northern hemisphere the longest day and the shortest night occur on st june
in the southern hemisphere the shortest day and the longest night occur on this day
this position of the earth is known as the summer solstice
in the northern hemisphere the shortest day and the longest night occur on nd december
in the southern hemisphere the longest day and the shortest night occur on this day
this position of the earth is known as the winter solstice
on st march and september rd the whole earth experiences equal’days and equal nights
this is phenomenon is known as equinox
on rd september it is autumn in the northern hemisphere and spring in the sourthern hemisphere
on st march it is spring in the northern hemisphere and autumn in the sourthern hemisphere
days and nights occur due to rotation while changes in seasons occur due to revolution
rotation the movement of the earth on its axis is known as rotation
revolution the movement of the earth around the sun in a fixed path or orbit is known as revolution
orbital plane the plane formed by the orbit is known as the orbital plane
circle of illumination the circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called the circle of illumination
leap year the year in which february is of  days instead of  days is called a leap year
in the southern hemisphere the shortest day and the longest night occur on this day
this position of the earth is called summer solstice
winter solstice in the northern hemisphere the shortest day and the longest night occur on nd december
in the southern hemisphere the longest day and the shortest night occur on this day
this position of the earth is called winter solstice
equinox on st march and september rd the entire earth experiences equal days and equal nights
this is known as the equinox
a map is a representation or a drawing of the earth’s surface or a part of it drawn on a flat surface according to a scale
when many maps are put together we get an atlas
physical maps show natural features of the earth
political maps show different boundaries of different countries and states
thematic maps focus on specific information
there are three components of maps—distance direction and symbol
distance  the scale is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map
 if you know the scale you will be able to calculate the distance between any two places on a map
 when large areas like continents or countries are to be shown on paper then we use a small scale map
 when a small area like your village or town is to be shown on paper then we use a large scale map
direction  there are four major directions north south east and west
they are called cardinal points
 we can find out the direction of a place with the help of a magnetic compass
 the blue colour is used for showing water bodies brown for mountains yellow for plateau and green is used for plains
sketch  a sketch is a drawing mainly based on memory and spot observation and not to scale
 a rough drawing is drawn without scale is called a sketch map
plan  a plan is a drawing of a small area on a large scale
 there are certain things which we may sometimes want to know for example the length and breadth of a room
a map is a representation or a drawing of the earth’s surface or a part of it drawn on a flat surface according to a scale
maps are of different types—physical maps political maps and thematic maps
physical maps show natural features of the earth political maps show cities towns countries etc
with their boundaries and thematic maps focus on some particular information such as maps showing distribution of population
the three components of maps are distance direction and symbol
a scale is needed to represent a small distance on paper for a large distance on the ground
thus scale is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map
a small scale map is used to show large areas like continents or countries on a paper
there are four major directions—north south east and west known as cardinal points
there are four intermediate directions—north-east ne south-east se south-west sw and north-west nw
symbols are used to show features like buildings roads bridges etc
by using symbols we make the map very informative
maps have a universal language
there is an international agreement regarding the use of these symbols
these are called conventional symbols
a sketch map is a rough drawing without scale
a plan is a drawing of a small area on a large scale
map it is a representation or a drawing of the earth’s surface or a part of it drawn on a flat surface according to a scale
scale it is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map
cardinal points the four directions—north south east and west—are called cardinal points
symbols to represent buildings roads bridges etc
on the map we use symbols
these symbols are of universal significance
sketch a sketch is a drawing mainly based on memory and spot observation and not to scale
the solid portion of the earth on which we live is called the lithosphere
the gaseous layer that surrounds the earth is the atmosphere
the area covered by water is called hydrosphere
the zone which contains all forms of life is called biosphere
lithosphere  it comprises the rocks of the earth’s crust and the thin layers of soil
 there are two main divisions of the earth’s surface
 the large landmasses are known as the continents
 the huge water bodies are called the ocean basins
continents  there are seven major continents

 africa is the second largest continent
it is the only continent through which the tropic of cancer the equator and the tropic of capricorn pass
 north america is the third largest continent of the world
 south america and north america are linked by a very narrow strip of land called the isthmus of panama
it is also called an island continent
 antarctica is permanently covered with thick ice sheets
  india has a research station named as maitri and dakshin gangotri at antarctica
hydrosphere  more than  % per cent of the earth is covered with water therefore the earth is called the blue planet
 more than % of the earth’s water is found in the oceans
oceans  the four major oceans are the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the indian ocean and the arctic ocean
 the pacific ocean is the largest ocean
 the atlantic ocean is the second largest ocean
 the indian ocean is the only ocean named after a country that is india
 the arctic ocean is located within the arctic circle
atmosphere  the atmosphere protects us from the harmful effects of the sun’s rays
 the atmosphere extends up to a height of about  kilometres
 the atmosphere is divided into five layers—the troposphere the stratosphere the mesosphere the thermosphere and the exosphere
 the atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen
biosphere – the domain of life  the biosphere is the narrow zone of contact between the land water and air
 increase in the amount of c leads to an increase in global temperature
this is termed as global warming
the earth is the only planet where human beings find three life sustaining elements— land water and air
the surface of the earth is a complex zone
here three main components of the environment—lithosphere atmosphere and hydrosphere meet overlap and interact
the lithosphere refers to the solid portion of the earth where we live
the atmosphere refers to the gaseous layers which surrounding the earth
the hydrosphere refers to the water bodies that exist on the earth’s surface
the biosphere is the narrow zone where we find land water and air together
the earth’s surface is divided into continents and ocean basins
continents are large landmasses of the earth while ocean basins are huge water bodies
mount everest is the highest mountain peak
its height is  metres above the sea level
the greatest depth of  metres is recorded at mariana trench in the pacific ocean
there are seven continents—asia europe africa north america south america australia and antarctica
antarctica is permanently covered with thick ice sheets
hence it is not suitable for human settlement
more than % of the earth is covered with water and % is with land
more than % of the earth’s water is found in the oceans
it is of no human use
a large proportion of the rest of the water is in the form of ice sheets and glaciers or under the ground
% of water is available as fresh water which is usable by human beings
there are four major oceans—the pacific ocean the atlantic ocean the indian ocean and the arctic ocean in order of their size
the indian ocean is the only ocean named after a country i
the atmosphere is divided into five layers
these layer starting from earth’s surface are—the troposphere the stratosphere the mesosphere the thermosphere and the exosphere
the atmosphere is composed of several gases—nitrogen % oxygen % other gases like carbondioxide argon and others comprise %
oxygen is essential for our life
we can not live without it
carbon dioxide absorbs heat radiated by the earth and in this way it keeps the earth warm
it is also essential for plants
the biosphere is the zone where life exists
from tiny microbes and bacteria to huge mammals are found in the biosphere
the three domains of the earth interact with each other and affect each other
for example emission from industries pollute the air
increase in the amount of co leads to an increase in global temperatures which is known as global warming
lithosphere the solid portion of the earth on which we live is termed as the lithosphere
atmosphere the gaseous layers that surround the earth is known as the atmosphere
hydrosphere the water bodies on the earth’s surface is known as hydrosphere
biosphere it is the narrow zone where land water and air together are found
all forms of life exists here
continents the large landmasses are called continents
ocean basins the huge water bodies are called the ocean basins
strait it is a narrow passage of water connecting two large water bodies like seas and oceans
isthmus it is a narrow strip of land joining two landmasses
plant kingdom the part of biosphere consisting of plants and trees
animal kingdom the part of biosphere consisting of an animal
this is known as global warming

 location of india  size of india  india and the world  neighbours of india
location india lies entirely in the northern hemisphere
india’s mainland extends between °’n and °’n latitudes and °’e and °’e longitudes
the tropic of cancer °’n divides india into two almost equal parts
the northernmost point of india which is under indian administration is near indira col siachen glacier
the southernmost point in india is indira point on nicobar island
size covering an area of 
 million square kilometres india’s total area is 
% of the total geographical area of the world
india’s east-west extent appears to be smaller than the north-south extent
india and the world the indian landmass is centrally located between west and east asia
india’s protruding deccan peninsula helped india to establish close contacts with west asia africa and europe south-east and east asia
india’s contacts with the world via land routes are much more than its maritime contacts
india has contributed a lot to the world in forms of ideas philosophies upanishads ramayana panchtantra and in mathematics indian numerals and decimal system algebra trigonometry and calculus
in exchange india’s architecture was influenced by greek sculpture and architectural styles from west asia
india’s neighbours india has an important position in south asia and has  states and  union territories
india shares its boundaries with pakistan afghanistan china nepal bangladesh myanmar and bhutan
the southern neighbours across the sea consist of the two island countries namely maldives and sri lanka
india stands apart from the rest of asia and is called a sub-continent
location india has all major physical features of the earth i
 mountains plains deserts plateaus and islands
in india the soil colour varies from place to place as it is formed from different types of rocks
india has varied physical features whose formation can be explained on the basis of the ‘theory of plate tectonics’
according to the theory of plate tectonics the seven major and minor plates that form the earth’s crust keep moving causing stress and thus leading to folding faulting and volcanic activity
the himalayas are  km long  km to  km wide from kashmir to arunachal pradesh respectively
the himalayas have three parallel ranges in the longitudinal extent namely   great or inner himalayas also called himadri
 middle himalayas or himachal
 outer himalayas or shiwaliks
the himalayas can be divided into four sections   punjab himalayas – between indus and satluj
 kumaon himalayas – between satluj and kali
 nepal himalayas – between kali and the tista
 assam himalayas eastern himalayas – between tista and the dibang tsangpo
the northern plains the northern plains spread over an area of  lakh sq
km  km long and  km to  km broad
the rivers that flow to the plains from the mountains are involved in depositional work
the difference in relief causes the northern plains to have four regions
 bhabar – adjacent to the foothills of shiwaliks a narrow  to  km wide belt of pebbles and boulders
 bangar – older alluvial plain which rises above the level of the flood plains
 khadar – newer and younger alluvial of the flood plains deposited by the rivers flowing down the plain
 tarai – lies adjacent to bhabar region composed of newer alluvium and is thickly forested
the plateau consists of two broad divisions namely the central highlands and the deccan plateau
the eastward extensions of peninsular plateau are locally known as bundelkhand and baghelkhand
the chhota nagpur plateau marks the further eastward extension drained by the damodar river
the deccan plateau a triangular mass lies to the south of the river narmada
the western and eastern edges of the deccan plateau are marked by the western ghats and the eastern ghats respectively
the western ghats are higher than the eastern ghats
the malwa plateau is spread across rajasthan madhya pradesh and gujarat and slopes towards the north
a distinct feature of the peninsular plateau is the black soil area known as deccan trap
the indian desert the undulating sandy plain covered with sand dunes towards the western margins of the aravalli hills is the indian desert
crescent-shaped dunes called barchans cover large parts of the indian desert
luni is the only large river that flouts in this region
the coastal plains the narrow’ coastal strips flank the peninsular plateau
on the east the coastal strip is divided into northern circar and the coromandel coast from northern to southern part
the islands the lakshadweep islands group in the arabian sea is close to kerala
the andaman and nicobar islands are the two island groups
andaman island consists of  small islands
india’s only active volcano barren island is situated here
 drainage patterns  various river basin system  pollution of rivers
drainage’ is a term signifying the river system of an area
a drainage basin or river basin is an area w’hich is drained by a single river system
an upland that separates two drainage systems that are next to each other is called a water divide
on the basis of origin there are two river systems of india — the himalayan rivers and the peninsular rivers
himalayan rivers are rainfed and snowfed so they have water in them throughout the year i
 they are perennial and thus navigable
himalayan rivers create meanders oxbow lakes and other depositional features on their course
peninsular rivers are seasonal mostly depending on rainfall and thus non-navigable
most of the rivers of peninsular india originate in the western ghats and flow’ towards the bay of bengal
the himalayan rivers a river along with its tributaries may be called a river system
the major himalayan rivers are the indus the ganga and the brahmaputra
the indus river system rising near lake mansarovar in tibet the indus enters india in the ladakh district of jammu and kashmir
with a total length of  km the indus is one of the longest rivers of the world
the ganga river system the headwaters of the ganga are called ‘bhagirathi’
bhagirathi is fed by the gangotri glacier and joined by the alaknanda at devprayag
ganga meets the tributaries from the himalayas such as ghaghara gandak kosi and the yamuna
a major river yamuna arising from yamunotri glader in the himalayas joins ganga at allahabad
other tributaries — chambal betwa and son — come from peninsular uplands to join ganga
ganga is joined by the brahmaputra and flows through bangladesh to reach the bay of bengal
the delta formed when the ganga and the brahmaputra flow into the bay of bengal is known as the sunderban delta
the length of the ganga is over  km and it develops large meanders
the brahmaputra river system originating in tibet very close to the sources of indus and satluj brahmaputra enters india in arunachal pradesh and flows to assam joined by many tributaries
the tributaries that join the brahmaputra are dibang lohit and kenula
the brahmaputra has a braided channel in its entire length in assam to form many riverine islands
unlike other north indian rivers the brahmaputra is marked by huge deposits of silt on its bed causing the riverbed to rise
the thai and narmada are the only rivers which flow west to make estuaries and drain into the arabian sea
the drainage basins of the peninsular rivers are comparatively small in size
the godavari basin the godavari begins in nasik district of maharashtra
it is the largest peninsular river
its large basin covers most parts of maharashtra madhya pradesh orissa and andhra pradesh
the tributaries which join the godavari include purna wardha pranhita manjra wainganga and penganga
because of its length and the area it covers the godavari is also known as the dakshin ganga
the godavari drains into the bay of bengal
the mahanadi basin the mahanadi a  km long river rises in chhattisgarh to flow through orissa to reach the bay of bengal
principal tributaries of mahanadi river are sheonath jonk hasdeo mand lb ong and tel
mahanadi river basin is shared by maharashtra orissa jharkhand and chhattisgarh
is is one of the major east flowing peninsular rivers draining into bay of bengal
the krishna basin the  km long krishna river rises from a spring in the mahadev range near mahabaleshwar and falls into the bay of bengal
the tributaries of krishna include bhima musi ghatprabha koyana and tungabhadra
the krishna basin is shared by maharashtra karnataka and andhra pradesh
narmada flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting
• narmada river has  tributaries
the important ones are barna ganjal chhota tawa hiran janatara kolar orsang sher
the tapi basin originating in betul madhya pradesh the tapi flows through a basin that covers madhya pradesh gujarat and maharashtra
the main west flowing rivers are sabarmati mahi bharatpuzha and periyar
the entire tapi basin can be divided into three sub-basins upper middle and lower and into two well- defined physical regions viz the hilly regions and the plains or tapi basin
the kaveri basin originating in the brahmagiri range of the western ghats the kaveri reaches the bay of bengal at kaveripatnam sharing its basin with karnataka tamil nadu kerala and puducherry or pondicherry
the main soil types found in the basin are red and yellow soils
lakes most lakes are permanent while others contain water only during the rainy season
some lakes are the result of the glacial action and ice sheets and some may have been formed by wind river action and human activities
a river meandering across a floodplain forms cut-offs that later develop into oxbow lakes
glacial lakes are formed when glaciers dig out a basin which is later filled with snowmelt
some lakes like wular lake in jammu and kashmir result from tectonic activity
lakes help to regulate river water flow prevent flooding aid to develop hydel power moderate climate maintain aquatic ecosystem enhance natural beauty develop tourism and provide recreation
role of rivers in the economy rivers are a natural source of water
it forms the main backbone for agriculture
settlements on the river banks have developed into cities
rivers are used for irrigation navigation hydropower generation all vital for india and agricultural economy
river pollution quality of river water is affected by the growing domestic municipal iftdustrial and agricultural demand
a heavy load of untreated sewage and industrial effluents are emptied into the river affecting the river’s self-cleansing property
concern over rising pollution in our rivers led to the launching of various action plans to clean the rivers like narmada bachao movement
the weather conditions including variations over a large area for a long period of time more than thirty years
the term weather refers to the state of the atmosphere at a place and time with reference to the following elements  temperature humidity  air pressure  cloudiness or sunshine  precipitation rainfall or snowfall  wind the weather conditions fluctuate very often within a day
based on the generalised fhonthly atmospheric conditions the year is divided into seasons such as winter summer and rainy seasons
the world is divided into a number of climatic regions
in asia india and other south and south-eastern countries have monsoon type of climate
the word monsoon is derived from the arabic word ‘mausim’ which literally means season
‘monsoon’ refers to the seasonal reversal in the wind direction during a year
regional climatic variation in india although there is an overall unity in the general climatic pattern in india there are some perceptible regional variations
temperature the temperature in the winter in north-western mountainous regions can go down to – ° c at drass in jammu and kashmir while it is °c in thiruvananthapuram in kerala
similarly it can go up to °c in summer in some parts of western rajasthan and °c in shillong
in many areas there is a wide variation between day and night temperatures
in the thar desert the day temperature may rise up to °c and drop down to near °c the same night
on the other hand there is hardly any difference in day and night temperatures in the andaman and nicobar islands or in kerala
precipitation there is a wide variation observed in its amount and seasonal distribution
precipitation in the form of snowfall occurs only in upper parts of himalayas the rest of the country receives rainfall
a typical example the annual precipitation varies from over  cm in meghalaya to less than  cm in ladakh and western rajasthan
coastal regions experience different weather conditions from the interior regions
for example temperature and seasonal contrast are relatively mild
the rainfall also decreases from east to west
such differences help to create a variety in lives of people— the food they eat the clothes they wear the kind of houses they used for living and so on
climatic controls permanent factors which govern the general nature of the climate of any location on the earth are called factors of climatic controls
the factors of climatic controls are m latitude the angular distance of a location from the equator in north-south direction is called latitude
due to the curvature of the earth latitude changes the amount of solar energy received
as a result air temperature decreases from the equator towards the poles
altitude it refers to the height above mean sea level
with increase of height from the earth surface the temperature decreases and air becomes less dense
therefore hilly regions are cooler in summer
pressure and wind system it depends on the latitude and altitude of a place
thus it influences the temperature and rainfall pattern of the area
continentality or distance from the sea the sea exerts a moderating influence on the climate
as the distance from the sea increases the weather conditions become more extreme high temperature and rainfall variation between seasons
ocean currents along with onshore winds the ocean currents warm or cold affect the climate of coastal areas
for example cold onshore currents bring coolness in coastal areas
relief features high mountains stop cold or hot winds from reaching a location
it can also cause rain or snow if the place is on the windward side of the mountains
the leeward side of the mountains are
factors affecting india’s climatic latitude the tropic of cancer ° cv n divides the country into the tropical zone south of this line and the sub-tropical zone north of this line
the line runs from the
rann of kuchchh west to mizoram east
all the remaining area north of tropic lies in sub-tropics
so india’s climate has characteristics of tropical as well as sub-tropical climates
the indian sub-continent experiences milder winters as compared to central asia because of the himalayas which prevent the cold winds from entering the sub-continent
pressure and winds the following atmospheric conditions govern the climate and associated weather conditions in india  pressure and surface winds  upper air circulation  western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones pressure and surface winds india lies in the region of north-easterly surface winds
these winds originate during winter from the sub-tropical high-pressure belt of the northern hemisphere
these winds blow south get deflected to the right due to the coriolis force and move towards the equatorial-low pressure region
these winds originate and blow over land and hence carry very little moisture
therefore they bring no rain or very little rain
the unique feature of indian pressure and wind conditions is its complete reversal
during winter high- pressure areas develop over the areas north of himalayas
this causes cold dry winds blow from the area towards low-pressure area over the oceans to the south
in summer due to high temperature low-pressure area develops over interior asia and over north-western india
air from high-pressure areas blow towards this region resulting in complete reversal of wind direction
as these winds from high pressure area of southern indian ocean crosses the equator and turns right towards low pressure areas of indian sub-continent
these winds gather large moisture while moving over the warm ocean and bring widespread rainfall over the mainland of india
these winds are known as the south-west monsoon winds
upper air circulation and western cyclonic disturbances the upper air circulation of the region indian subcontinent is dominated by a westerly flow which is governed by jet stream
due to their location over °-° n latitude these jet streams are known as sub-tropical westerly jet streams
they blow south of the himalayas throughout the year except in summer
western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclones the western cyclonic disturbances are weather phenomena of the winter months brought in by the westerly flow from the mediterranean region
they usually influence the weather of the north and north-western regions of india
these disturbances affect ti e coastal regions of the country
the westerly flow brings the western cyclonic disturbances in the north and north-western india
in summer the sub-tropical westerly jet stream moves north of the himalayas due to apparent shifting of the sun
an easterly jet stream called sub-tropical easterly jet stream blows over peninsular india approximately over ° n during the summer months
this is known as ferrel’s law
this law states that a wind in any direction tends to deflect towards right west to east in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere with a force that is directly proportional to the mass of the wind in question its velocity the sine of the latitude and the angular velocity of the earth’s rotation
jet stream these are a narrow belt of high altitude above  m westerly winds’in the troposphere
their speed varies from about  kmh in summer to about  kmh in winter
a number of separate jet streams have been identified
the most constant are the mid-latitude and the subtropical jet stream
the indian monsoon monsoon winds strongly influence climate of india
the monsoons are experienced in the tropical area roughly between ° n and ° s
this is the equatorial trough normally positioned about °n of the equator
it is also known as the ‘monsoon trough’ during the monsoon season
the presence of the high-pressure area east of madagascar approximately °s over the indian ocean
the intensity and position of this high-pressure area affect the indian monsoon
the tibetan plateau gets intensely heated during summer which results in strong vertical air currents and the formation of low pressure over the plateau at about  km above sea level
the movement of the westerly jet stream to the north of the himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the indian peninsula during summer
apart from the given facts it has been noticed that changes in the pressure conditions over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons
normally when the tropical eastern south pacific ocean experiences high pressure the tropical eastern indian ocean experiences low pressure
but in past a few years there is a reversal in the pressure conditions and the eastern pacific has lower pressure in comparison to the eastern indian ocean
this periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the southern oscillation so
el nino southern oscillations enso the difference in pressure over tahiti pacific ocean °s°w and darwin in northern australia indian ocean °’s°e is computed to predict the intensity of the monsoons
if the pressure differences were negative it would mean below average and late monsoons
the el nino phenomenon is a feature connected with the southern oscillation
in this a warm ocean current flows past the peruvian coast in place of the cold peruvian current
it occurs at the interval of  to  years
the changes in pressure conditions are connected to the el nino
hence the phenomenon is referred to as enso el nino southern oscillations
the onset and withdrawal of the monsoon the trade winds are steady but the monsoon winds are pulsating in nature
they are affected by different atmospheric conditions encountered by it on its way over the warm tropical area
starting from early june in the southern part of the indian peninsula the monsoon lasts between  and  days withdrawing by mid-september
this phenomenon is called as burst of monsoon
it is different from pre-monsoon showers
afterwards it alternates with wet and dry spells
onset of monsoon monsoon generally reaches the southern tip of the peninsula during the first week of june
after striking the southern tip it branches into two parts- the arabian sea branch and the bay of bengal branch both branches move rapidly
the arabian sea branch advances north along the western ghats reaching mumbai by about th of june and soon covers the saurashtra-kuchchh and central most part of the deccan plateau also
the bay of bengal branch reaches assam in the first week of june and gets deflected towards the west by the mountain ranges thus giving rainfall to the ganga plains
both the branches again merge over the north-western part of the ganga plains
delhi receives rainfall from bay of bengal branch by the end of june tentative date is th june and by the first-week of july monsoon covers western uttar pradesh punjab haryana and eastern rajasthan
withdrawal of monsoon withdrawal or the retreat of the monsoon is a more gradual process
the process begins by early september in north-western states
by mid-october it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula
the withdrawal from the southern half of the peninsula is fairly rapid
by early december the » monsoon has withdrawn from the rest of the country
onset and withdrawal of monsoon in the indian islands the islands receive the very first monsoon showers from the last week of april to the first week of may
the withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south in reverse direction from the first week of december to the first week of january
by this time the rest of the country is already under the influence of the winter monsoon
important features of monsoon the important features of monsoon are as follows  the monsoon is also known for its uncertainties
 there is an alteration of dry and wet spells which vary in intensity frequency and duration
 while it causes heavy floods in one part it may be responsible for drought in other parts
 its irregular arrival and retreat sometimes due to the effect of el nino causing disruption
of farming schedules and causing droughts in certain areas of the country
the weather conditions in india greatly change from one season to another
these changes are particularly noticeable in the interior parts of the country
the coastal areas do not experience much variation in temperature though there is variation in rainfall pattern
there are basically four seasons identified in india
the cold weather season winter the cold weather season begins from mid-november and stays till february in northern parts of india with december and january as the coldest months
the temperature decreases from south to north
for instance the average temperature of chennai on the eastern coast is between °— °c while in northern plains it ranges between °—°c
during this season days are warm and nights are cold
frost occurs in the northern plains and snow falls in the high mountainous regions of himalayas
as the north-east trade winds blow during this period most of the country remains dry as they blow from land towards sea
the only rain occurs in tamil nadu and southern andhra pradesh due to these winds picking up moisture from the bay of bengal
features of cold weather season the characteristic features of cold weather season are a feeble weak high pressure region develops in the northern part of the country
influenced by the relief the light winds moving outwards from this area blow through the ganga valley from the west and the north-west
clear sky low temperature and humidity and feeble variable winds are the characteristics of the weather during the period
there is an inflow of cyclonic disturbances from the west and the north-west which have originated over the mediterranean sea and western asia
they cause winter rains over the plains and snowfall in the mountains
this winter rainfall though in small amount is locally known as mahawat
it is useful for cultivation of the rabi crops
the peninsular region has moderating effect from sea and hence it doesn’t have well defined cold seasons
also there is hardly any noticeable change in temperature pattern
the hot weather seasonsummer the hot weather season starts with the apparent movement of the sun towards the north
it leads to the northward movement of global heat belt
the hot weather season starts in march and lasts upto the end of may
the summer months experience rising temperature and falling air pressure
towards the end of may an elongated low-pressure area develops in the region extending from thar desert in north-west to patna and chotanagpur plateau in the east and south-east
this results into beginning of air circulation around this trough
a hot gusty and dry wind locally known as loo blows
during this season over the north and north-western india and can cause even death if persons are exposed to it for a long time
dust storms are very common in north india in the month of may
they bring temporary relief from the heat by lowering the temperature and may also cause light rain and cold breeze
localised thunderstorms also occur during summer which may have high speed winds and even precipitate hail
such thunderstorms are called kaal baisakhi in west bengal
near the end of summer there may be pre-monsoon showers
these are called mango showers in kerala and karnataka as they help in the early ripening of the mango fruit
temperature variation during hot weather the influence of the shifting of heat belt can be seen from temperature recordings taken during march to may at different latitudes
in march the highest temperature is about °c recorded in deccan plateau
temperature in gujarat and madhya pradesh is around °c in the month of april
in may north-western parts of the country experience temperature around °
due to moderating influence of the oceans temperature remains lower in peninsular india
advancing monsoon the rainy season the low-pressure area over the northern plains intensifies by mid-june and attracts the trade winds
these trade winds originate over the warm tropical ocean in the southern hemisphere
after crossing equator these blow in the south-west direction entering peninsula as south- west monsoon
they cover the entire subcontinent except extreme north-west in just over one month
maximum rainfall due to these winds occurs in north-eastern india mainly meghalaya and assam and the windward side of the western ghats thiruvananthapuram to mumbai as these winds bring abundant moisture to the sub-continent at a velocity of  kmph
rainfall in the western ghats and deccan plateau the monsoon winds cover the country in about a month
a total change in weather is brought up in india by the inflow of the south-west monsoon in india
the windward side of the western ghats receives very heavy rainfall more than  cm in the early season
inspite lying in the rain shadow area the deccan plateau and parts of madhya pradesh also receive some amount of rainfall
the highest average rainfall in the world falls at mawsynram in the southern ranges of the khasi hills in meghalaya
in the northern plains precipitation decreases from east to west with western parts of rajasthan and northern parts of gujarat getting the least rainfall
features of advancing monsoon features of advancing monsoon are as follows wet and dry spells monsoon in india does not bring continuous rainfall
it has wet and dry spells i
these breaks in monsoon are related to the movement of monsoon trough
the axis of the monsoon trough in the northern plains keeps moving north to south and back causing periodic breaks in rainfall
due to this it has wet and dry spells
the monsoon rains take place only for a few days at a time
they are interspersed as rainless intervals
monsoon trough the trough and its axis keep on moving northward or southward which determines the spatial distribution of rainfall
when the axis of the trough lies over the plains the region gets good rainfall
with the northward movement of axis the himalayan region gets widespread rain which is the catchment area of various rivers
this causes devastating floods in the plains causing heavy damage to life and property
tropical depression another phenomenon which determines amount and suration of the monsoon is the frequency and intensity of tropical depression which form at the head of the bay of bengal and cross over to mainland
these depressions follow the axis of the ‘monsoon trough of low pressure’
retreatingpost monsoon season the transition season the sun starts shifting towards the south during october-november
during this time the low pressure trough over the northern plains weakens and is replaced gradually by a high- pressure system
this is followed by the south-west monsoon winds
by the beginning of october the monsoon withdraws from the northern plains
the months of october-november form a transition period from hot rainy to dry winter conditions
features of retreating monsoon the characteristic features of retreating monsoon are the period is marked by clear skies and rise in temperature
the day temperatures are high but nights are cool and pleasant
due to the temperature still remaining high and humidity not reducing the heat is oppressive
this phenomenon is also called october heat
cyclonic depression and tropical cyclone by early november cyclonic depressions originate over the andaman sea
these cyclones generally cross the eastern coast of india causing heavy and widespread rain
often they cause a lot of destruction
sometimes these cyclones arrive at the coasts of odisha west bengal and bangladesh
these cyclones frequently strike the populated deltas of the godavari krishna and kaveri
the coromandel coast gets its monsoon rainfall mostly during october and november from the cyclones and due to the retreating monsoon picking up moisture over the bay of bengal
however it is less than  cm in western rajasthan and adjoining parts of gujarat haryana and punjab
rainfall is equally low in the interior of the deccan plateau and east of the sahyadris
a third area of low precipitation is around leh in jammu and kashmir
the rest of the country receives moderate rainfall
snowfall is restricted to the himalayan region
owing to the nature of monsoons the annual rainfall is highly variable from year to year
variability is high in the regions of low rainfall such as parts of rajasthan gujarat and the leeward side of the western ghats
due to this the areas of high rainfall are liable to be affected by floods whereas areas of low rainfall are drought-prone
monsoon as a unifying bond northern india has comparatively higher temperatures than other areas of the world at a similar latitude due to the himalayas protecting it from the cold central asian winds
the peninsular plateau has moderate temperatures due to the influence of the sea on three sides
the monsoon provides a great variation despite such moderating influences
however the monsoon unites the land like no other force because it provides a rhythmic cycle of seasons
the vegetation animal life and agricultural activities are all revolving around the effects of the monsoon
the life of the people their celebration of festivals and other activities all are geared to the monsoon as india is still primarily an agricultural nation
the monsoon provides the water to set agricultural activities in motion and hence the arrival of the monsoon is awaited eagerly
the river valleys which carry this water also unite as single river valley unit
weather is the state of the atmosphere over an area at any point of time
various elements of weather and climate are temperature atmospheric pressure wind humidity and precipitation
india along with south and south-east asia has monsoon type of climate
the climate of any place is controlled by latitude altitude pressure and wind system distance from the sea ocean currents and relief features
high mountain by blocking the rain-bearing winds helps in causing rainfall in windward side of mountain
the atmospheric conditions which govern the climate and weather condition of india are- pressure and surface winds upper air circulation western cyclonic disturbances and tropical cyclone
coriolis force which is generated by the rotation of the earth is responsible for deflecting winds towards the right in northern hemisphere and towards the left in southern hemisphere
south-west monsoon winds are south-east trade winds of southern hemisphere which after crossing equator become south-western trade winds due to rightward deflection by coriolis force
as they blow over warm ocean they cause rainfall in indian sub-continent
jet streams are fast blowing winds moving in the upper atmosphere
they are located at about °-° north latitude
shallow cyclonic depressions originating over the mediterranean sea are known as western disturbances
they cause winter rainfall in-north western parts of india
monsoon is derived from arabic word ‘mausim’
it refers to the reasonal reversal in wind direction throughout the year
the inter tropical convergence zone itcz is a broad trough of low pressure in equatorial latitude
in itcz there is convergence of north-east and south-east trade wind
southern oscillation so is the reversal of pressure conditions and vice-versa in southern pacific ocean and eastern indian ocean
the changes in pressure conditions are connected to el nino hence the phenomenon is referred to as enso
monsoons are pubating in nature and are affected by different atmospheric conditions
the arabian sea branch of monsoon causes rainfall in western ghat mumbai gujarat and central india
the bay of bengal branch of monsoon causes rainfall in north-east india and ganga plain
the sudden and continuous rain associated with violent thunder and lightning is called burst of monsoon
it occurs around the time of arrival of monsoon
arabian sea branch and bay of bengal branch are the two branches of south-west monsoon in india
el nino is a warm ocean current that flows past the peruvian coast in place of cold peruvian current every  to  years
’ cold weather hot weather advancing monsoon and retreating monsoon are four-main seasons in india
the cold weather season is associated with clear sky low temperature low humidity and feeble variable wind
due to the moderating influence of sea the peninsular region does not have a well defined cold season
loo is hot and dry winds blowing during the day over the north and north-western india in the summer season
kaal baisakhi is a pre-monsoon shower in west bengal
this localised thunderstorm of the summer season is associated with violent winds torrential downpours and is often accompanied by hail
world’s highest rainfall occurs in mawsynram
it is located in southern range of khasi hills in meghalaya
monsoon occurs in dry and wet spells
the rainless intervals interspersing the monsoon rain is called ‘breaks in monsoon
’ the monsoon trough is the intense and elongated low-pressure area which develops over north-western india
it extends from the thar desert in west to chota nagpur plateau in east
it helps in early ripening of mangoes
the hot and humid condition which makes the weather oppressive is called october heat
it occurs towards the end of retreating monsoon in the month of october
with a rhythmic cycle of seasons in which people celebrate many festivals and do other activities the monsoon unites the indian sub-continent and acts as a unifying bond
they are a group of countries that have the majority of the earth’s species and therefore considered extremely bio-diverse
being a vast country india having  plant species out of which  are flowering plants i
 per cent in the world occupies th position worldwide and th in asia
non- flowering plants such as ferns algae and fungi also grow here
it also has around  species of animals including marine and water fishes and insects
natural vegetation natural or virgin vegetation means the plant community which has grown naturally without any human intervention for a long time
that natural vegetation which are left undisturbed over a long period of time are called virgin vegetation
virgin vegetation are of two types  endemic species those plant species which originated from the country are termed as endemic species
 exotic species those plant species which originated outside the country are termed as exotic species
factors affecting diversity factors which influence the variety of flora and fauna include relief land and soil climate temperature photoperiod and precipitation and the ecosystem
these are as follows relief it includes land and soil
land it affects the natural vegetation both directly and indirectly
the nature of the land i
whether it is plain hilly or a plateau determines the kind of vegetation which will grow in it
fertile lands are used for growing crops vegetables and fruits
undulating wavy and rough surfaces generally develop either into grasslands or woodlands forests
different types of land accordingly sustain and provide shelter to different kinds of wildlife
soil the soils also vary place to place
different kinds of soils provide different kinds of vegetation
the sandy soils of desert sustain thorny bushes
note animals and birds also inhabit locations based on relief
for example migratory birds like the siberian cranes and flamingoes are found to nest in the wetlands of the rann of kuchchh where the desert merges with the sea
climate it includes temperature photoperiod and precipitation
temperature the temperature along with the humidity in the air and precipitation determine the character of vegetation and its extent
as the climate gets colder either by increase in altitude above m or by going away from the equator the vegetation will change from tropical to sub-tropical temperate and then alpine
for example on the slopes of the himalayas and hills of the peninsula the fall in temperature affects the type of vegetation and its growth
photoperiod sunlight the amount and duration of sunlight is known as photoperiod
the difference in latitude altitude and season brings variation in duration of sunlight in different places
in warmer regions and climates plant growth is faster due to longer duration of sunlight especially with availability of adequate moisture
an instance is the fact that the southern slopes of the himalayas are covered with thicker vegetation than the northern slopes
precipitation advancing south-west monsoon june to september and retreating north-east october- november monsoons bring almost all the rainfall in india
areas of heavy rainfall always have denser vegetation than other areas with lesser rainfall
the south-west monsoon rains on the windward side of the western ghats thus cause a heavy growth of tropical evergreen forests there whereas the leeward side does not have any such forests
to a large extent its nature determines the animal life in that area
all the plants and animals in an area are interdependent on each other in their physical environment and form an ecosystem
biome it is a major community of plants and animals having similar life forms existing under similar environmental conditions
a biome is identified on the basis of plant existing there
it is also termed as ‘major life zone’
human influence in an ecosystem human beings influence ecosystem in the following manner  they utilise the vegetation and wildlife
 the greed of human beings leads to over utilisation of natural resources
 human beings cut the trees and kill the animals creating ecological imbalance
 due to the activities of human beings some of the ‘ plants and animals have reached the verge of extinction
importance of forests forests are advantageous for the environment
they influence climate reduce soil erosion regulate stream flow provide raw material for industries and livelihood for many etc
they control wind force and temperature and cause rainfall
they also provide shelter to various animal species
change in nature of vegetation in india factors like growing demand for cultivated land development of industries and mining urbanisation have changed natural vegetation
the vegetation cover of india in large parts is no more natural in the real sense except in some inaccessible regions like the himalayas the hilly region of central india and the marusthali
in most of the places it is either modified replaced or degraded by human interference
types of vegetation relief and climatic factors develop different types of vegetation
based on the major forest types india has following types of vegetation
tropical thorn forests and scrubs 
% in the year 
tropical evergreen forests these are also called tropical rainforests
they cover about % of the total forested areas of india
they are found in areas where the annual rainfall is over  cm
characteristics of tropical evergreen forest  as these areas are warm and wet almost throughout the year they have abundant vegetation with tall trees up to  m creepers and bushes
 the vegetation occurred in a multilayered structure
 these appear green throughout the year as the trees shed their leaves at different times
flora and fauna ebony mahogany cinchona rubber and rosewood trees are useful commercial trees found here
animals found here include rhinoceros elephants various species of monkey lemur deer many bird varieties bats sloth scorpions and snails
tropical deciduous forests these cover about % of the fetal forested areas of the country and are the most abundant variety of forests in india
these are also called monsoon forests and also spread over the region receiving rainfall between  to  cm
trees of this forest type shed their leaves for about  to  weeks in dry summer
types of tropical deciduous forest on the basis of the availability of water these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous
they cover about % of the country’s forested area
they are found mostly in the eastern part of the country such as north-eastern states west odisha jharkhand chhattisgarh foothills of the himalayas and the leeward side of the western ghats
teak dominant species bamboo sal shisham sandalwood khair kusum arjun and mulberry trees are found in these forests
dry deciduous forests growing in annual rainfall areas between  and ‘ cm are classified as dry deciduous
they cover about % of the country’s forested area
these are found in rainier parts of the peninsular plateau and the plains of uttar pradesh and bihar
teak sal peepal and neem trees grow in these areas
many parts of these areas have been cleared for agricultural activities and for grazing
besides lions tigers elephants pigs and deer many varieties of birds lizards snakes and tortoises are found in these forests
tropical thorn forests and scrubs these cover about % of the total forested areas of india
these are found in areas where the annual rainfall is less than  cm
region of occurrence these are found in north-western part of the country including semi-arid areas of gujarat rajasthan some areas of uttar pradesh chattisgarh haryana and madhya pradesh as well as parts of the deccan plateau
characteristics of tropical thorn forests and scrubs the trees found in tropical thorn forest and scrubs are scattered
other such plants which have long roots succulent stems and small thick leaves are also found here
all these characteristics have developed to minimise evaporation and conserve moisture
only scrubs are found in desert areas with the least rainfall
flora and fauna trees like acacia palm euphorbia and cactus found in these areas
fox wolf rats and mice wild ass horses tiger lion camels and similar animals are found in these areas
montane forests these forests cover about % of the total forested areas of india and are found in mountainous areas of jammu and kashmir himachal pradesh uttarakhand sikkim and arunachal pradesh
natural vegetation changes with corresponding change in temperature with increasing altitude in the mountainous region
these succession of natural vegetation belts is same as in the order from tropical to tundra vegetation
 temperate forest at the altitude between - m temperate forests containing coniferous trees like pine deodar silver fir spruce and cedar are found
these forests cover mostly the southern slopes of the himalayas places having high altitude in southern and north-east india
 temperate grasslands these are found at higher elevations
at high altitude above  m temprate forest and grasslands give way to the alpine vegetation
 alpine vegetation this vegetation through shrubs and scrubs merge into alpine grasslands
these area extensively used by nomadic tribes like gujjars and bakarwals for grazing
 tundra vegetation mosses and lichens are part of tundra vegetation are found at higher altitudes
flora and fauna kashmir stag spotted dear wild sheep jack rabbit tibetan antelope yak snow leopard squirrels shaggy horn wild ibex bear and rare red panda sheep and goats with thick hair are found here
silver firs pines junipers birches etc are trees common here
mangrove forests these are found in coastal delta areas influenced by sea tides
due to this fact they are also called tidal forests
the roots of the predominate mangroves are submerged under water
such forests are found in the delta areas of rivers oh the east coast of india ganga brahmaputra mahanadi godavari krishna and kaveri due to mud and silt brought down by the rivers
flora and fauna  in the ganga-brahmaputra delta sundari trees providing durable timber are prominent
other trees are palm coconut keora and agar
 animals found here include the royal bengal tigers snakes turtles gharials and crocodiles
wildlife india is also rich in its fauna animal life same as in flora plant life
it has approximately  animal species and  species of birds
they constitute % of the total world’s stock
there are  species of fish which account for nearly % of the world’s stock
it also shares between  and  % of the world’s amphibians reptiles and mammals
the existence of animals in our country varies place to place
distribution of wildlife in india the elephants are the most majestic animals among the mammals
they are found in the hot wet forests of assam karnataka and kerala
arid areas of the rann of kachchh and the thar desert are the habitat for wild ass and camels respectively
india is the only country in the world that has both tigers and lions
the natural habitat of the indian lion is the gir forest in gujarat
tigers are found in the forests of madhya pradesh the sunderbans of west bengal and the himalayan region
leopards too are members of the cat family
they are important among animals of prey
the himalayas harbour a hardy range of animals which survive in extreme cold
ladakh’s freezing high altitudes are a home to yak the shaggy horned wild ox weighing around  tonne the tibetan antelope the bharal blue sheep wild sheep and the kiang tibetan wild ass
the ibex bear snow-leopard and very rare red panda are found in certain pockets
in the rivers lakes and coastal areas turtles crocodiles and gharials are found
the gharial is the only representative of a variety of crocodile found in the world today
birdlife in india is colourful
peacocks pheasants ducks parakeets cranes and pigeons are some of the birds inhabiting the forests and wetlands of the country
indian bison nilgai blue bull chousingha four homed antelope gazel and different species of deer are some other animals found in india in different places
it also has several species of monkeys
note the gir forest is the last remaining habitat of the asiatic lion
wildlife protection act was implemented in  in india
migratory birds some of the wetlands of india are popular with migratory birds
during winter birds such as siberian crane come in large numbers
one such place favourable with birds is the rann of kutch
at a place where the desert merges with the sea flamingo with their brilliant pink plumage come in thousands to build nest mounds from the salty mud and raise their young ones
it is one among many extraordinary sights in the country
need of environment conservation our crops consist of edible plants from a bio-diverse environment
the animals were selected from large stock provided by nature as milch animal
they also provided us draught power transportation meat eggs
the fish provide nutritive food
many insects help in pollination of crops and fruit trees
they also exert biological control on such insects which are harmful
thus it can be said that every species has a role to play in the ecosystem
so its conservation is essential
due to excessive exploitation of the plants and animal resources by human beings the ecosystem has been disturbed
about  plant species are endangered and  species are extinct
quite a few animal species are also endangered and some have become extinct
summary india is one of the twelve mega biodiverse countries in the world
natural vegetation which are left undisturbed by human for a long time is termed as virgin vegetation
the type of virgin vegetation which are purely indian are called endemic or indigenous species
the virgin vegetation which comes from outside the country are called exotic species
variousrelief and climatic factors are responsible for distribution of natural vegetation
land and soil are the relief factors affecting the type of vegetation
temperature photoperiod and precipitation are the climatic factor affecting vegetation of a region
based on temperature vegetation zones are divided into tropical sub-tropical temperate and alpine type
forest are renewable resources and play major role in enhancing quality of environment
most of india’s natural vegetation are found in himalayas hilly regions of central india and in desert
biomes are very large ecosystem on land and have distinct types of vegetation and animal life
major vegetation types identified in india are tropical evergreen forests tropical deciduous forests tropical thorn forest and scrubs montane forests and mangrove forests
tropical evergreen forest is found in region of very high rainfall
tropical deciduous forest or monsoon forests are the most widespread forests of india
the thorn forest and scrubs are found in region with less that  cm rainfall
montane forests are high altitude alpine vegetation
mangroves are tidal vegetation found along the coastal region
sundari is an important mangrove tree
india has % of the world’s total bird species and % fish stocks
the wildlife protection act in india was implemented in 
the excessive exploitation of the plants and animal resources by human beings led them to become endangered and extinct
hunting pollution the introduction of alien plant and animal species deforestation are major threats for the ecosystem
government of india has taken many steps to protect plant and animals such as – setting up of national parks biosphere reserves etc the introduction of different projects to conserve critically endangered species e
project tiger project rhino etc
we all should be aware of the fact that a natural ecosystem is very important for our survival
a well-educated healthy population provides potential power to the nation
the people are important to develop the economy and society they make resources and use them
the people are themselves a resource with varying qualities
a census is an official enumeration numbering of population done periodically
the first census in india partial was done in 
while the first complete census was done in 
it is done every  years
the recent census was done in 
the census of india provides information regaling the population
the three aspects concerned about population are as follows  size and distribution of population it refers to the total number of people in the country and where they are located
 population growth and process of population change it refers to how the population has grown and changes in its composition
 characteristics of qualifies of life population it refers to age sex-ratio literacy levels occupational structure health conditions of people
population size and distribution hie arrangement or a spread of people of a country in different places is catted population distribution
size of population and its distribution can be studied under two heads- one population size and distribution by numbers and other in population distribution by density
india’s population size and distribution by numbers as per  census population of india stood at  million which is 
% of the total world population
it is unevenly distributed over the various states with uttar pradesh having the highest population  million accounts for about 
 per cent of the countries population and sikkim the lowest population 
 million accounts for about 
 per cent of the country’s population
among union territories delhi has the highest 
 million and lakshadweep the lowest  population
pradesh while rajasthan being largest state accounted for only % of the total population
india’s population distribution by density the uneven population distribution can be better judged by the population density in the various states
the number of people living per unit area sq
km in an area state or country is called population density of that area
india is one of the most destiny populated countries in the world
after bangladesh and japan it is the third most densely populated country
india’s population density in  was  persons per sq km this increased to  persons per sq km in the  census with west bengal having the highest density of  persons per sq km and arunachal pradesh the lowest with only  persons per sq
according to  census bihar has the highest population density  persons per sq km and arunachal pradesh having the lowest population density of  persons per sq km
on the basis of population density inhale country is divided in to three regions high population density states these states are characterised by flat plains with fertile soils and abundant rainfall e
states of northern plains and kerala
assam and most of the peninsular states
low population density states states with – low population density below  person per sq
km are characterised by rugged terrain mountainous and desert and unfavourable climatic condition e
arunachal pradesh sikkim and jammu and kashmir etc
 population growth and processes of population change due to births deaths and migrations the number distribution and composition of population change continuously
usually it is mostly calculated at the interval of  years
the change can be expressed either in terms of absolute numbers or in terms of annual growth rate
absolute increase of population it means the absolute numbers added each year or in each decade in the population
it is obtained by simply subtracting the earlier population e
that of  from the later population e
annual growth rate of population the rate at which the number of individuals in a population increase in  year as a fraction of the initial population is called annual growth rate of population
it is expressed in terms of per cent per annum
for example a rate of increase of % per annum means that there was an increase of  persons for every  persons in the initial population
population growth rate since independence india’s annual growth rate of population increased steadily till 
since then the annual rate of population growth started declining
still the population growth of india in s was  million in terms of number
this addition of people was larger than ever before
inspite of decreasing annual growth rate in percent the largest addition in peoplein terms of number is due to the large population of the country
a low growth rate results a large absolute increase due to very high population
however the declining growth rate is a positive indicator for the efforts of birth control but the total additions to the population continue to grow
if this rate of increase continues then india will surpass china by  to become the most populous country in the world
the natural increase of population or the growth rate is the difference between birth rates and death rates
birth rate the number of live births per thousand persons in a year is called birth rate
the birth rate is a major component of population growth as in india it has been always higher than the death rate
death rate the number of deaths per thousand persons in a year is called death rate
the main cause of the rate of growth of the indian population has been the rapid decline in death rates
there has been a rapid decline in death rates during the last  years due to better healthcare and nutrition which have made this factor also important for growth of population
the trend of population growth due to birth rate and death rate high birth rates and declining death rates were the phenomena till  which resulted date of birth population growth
after that due to government efforts and increased awareness the birth fate also started to decline resulting in gradual decline in the population growth rate
migration it is the movement of people across regions and territories
the movement of people within the country from one place to another is called internal migration
it does not change the population size but it changes the population distribution of an area
the movement of people from one country to other is called international migration
it changes population size of the country as well as population distribution
migration pattern in india in india most of the recent migrations have been from rural areas to urban areas
this is due to poverty and unemployment in rural areas push factors and increased employment opportunity and better living conditions in urban places pull factors
the urban population has increased from 
% of the total population in  to 
there has been a significant increase in the number of million plus cities from  to  in just a decade i
characteristics or qualities of the population age composition the number of people in different age groups in a country is called its age composition
it is one of the most basic characteristics of a population
the age of a person influences his needs purchases his capacity to perform
generally in india people are classified into the following three age groups
ii working age - years they are economically and biologically reproductive
they comprise the working population
the working age group is an economically productive group
in  this group comprised 
% of the population while children made up 
 % and the aged only 
iii aged above  years they can be economically productive though they may have retired
they may be working voluntarily but they are not available for employment through recruitment
dependent population the population of children and aged people together constitute the dependent population
they are termed dependent because they are not producers
sex ratio the sex ratio is the number of females per  males in the population
it is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females in a society at a given time
in india the sex ratio has always been unfavourable to females due to reasons of tradition and unscrupulous actions of people
certain states which are progressive like kerala have a very favourable sex ratio
as per census  the sex ratio of kerala is  compared to  for all of india
puducherry has  females for every  males while delhi has only  females p*r thousand males and haryana has just  females per thousand
the total percentage of the population of an area at a particular time aged seven years or above who can read and write with understanding is called literacy rate
although there has been a regular increase in literacy rates in the country rural literacy lags behind urban literacy significantly and female literacy lags behind male literacy by a huge margin
according to census  literacy rate in the country is 
it has revealed that urban literacy rate was 
 % while that in the rural areas was only 
similarly female literacy was only 
 % while that for males was 
occupational structure occupational structure referred to as the distribution’^ population according to various types of occupation
economically active population percentage is an important index of development
there is a large variety of occupation in the country
the occupations are usually categorised into primary secondary and tertiary occupations
primary occupations are those in which natural resources are extracted from the earth
these include agriculture fishery forestry mining quarrying etc
secondary occupations are those in which the extracted natural resources are processed into products for use
these include manufacturing refining construction etc
this transportation communications commerce administration legal services etc
the pattern of the working population the proportion of people working in different activities vary in developed and developing countries
the developing countries have more of their population working in primary occupations whereas the developed nations have more of their population working in secondary and tertiary occupations
in india half of the population is engaged in agriculture alone
however due to industrialisation and urbanisation in recent times there has occurred a significant shift towards secondary and tertiary occupations which earlier stood about % and % respectively
health health is an important component of population composition
it affects its development significantly
due to the sustained efforts of government healthcare programmes life expectancy at birth has improved from 
 years in  to 
the death rate has declined from  per  persons in  to 
however healthcare and nutrition are still major issues
malnutrition in children afflicts a large percentage of the population
availability of safe drinking -water and proper sanitation are major problems in rural areas and need urgent action
only one-third of the rural population has these basic amenities
the level of nutrition and per capital calorie consumption is much below the recommended level
this can be reduced by appropriate policy on population
adolescent population adolescents are population aged from  to  years
they currently comprise about % of india’s population and are an important future resource for the country
their nutritional requirements are more than that of either adults or younger children but it our country the diet available for them is usually inadequate for their requirements which leads to deficiency and stunted growth
many adolescent girls suffer from anaemia and they must be made aware of their requirements through better education and literacy they confront
national population policy after recognising that the family planning would improve individual health and welfare the government of india initiated its first family planning programme in 
this promoted responsible and planned parenthood on a voluntary basis
 reducing infant mortality rate to below  per  live births
 achieving universal immunisation of children against all vaccine-preventable diseases
 promoting delayed marriage for girls
 making family welfare a people-centred programme
npp  and adolescents national population policy npp  identified adolescents as one of the major sections of the population that need greater attention
npp  put greater emphasis on the important needs of adolescents including protection from unwanted pregnancies’ sexually transmitted diseases stds and risks of unprotected sex
it focussed on programmes that aim towards encouraging delayed marriage and childbearing education of adolescents providing food supplements and nutritional services etc
summary human beings are important resources who not only utilise resources and but also create social and cultural environment
‘resources’ ‘calamities’ and disasters’ becomes meaningful when taken in relation to a human being
the number distribution growth and characteristics of human beings provide basic background for understanding and appreciating various aspects of the environment
the census is official information about the population of a country done at regular interval mostly  year period
india has huge population of over a billion and the population is distributed unevenly throughout the country
the uneven distribution of population can be known by calculating population density of an area which is the number of people per unit area
more than half of india’s population resides in five states of uttar pradesh maharashtra bihar west bengal and andhra pradesh
india has the third highest population density in the world which is just after bangladesh and japan
rugged terrain and unfavourableclimatic condition are reason for sparse population in some regions such as arunachal pradesh
the high population density in india is found in the northern plain and kerala
the flat plain area with fertile soils and abundant rainfall are major factors contributing to high population density
the change in the number of inhabitants of a country at a particular period of time is called growth of population
growth of the population is affected by births deaths and migration
the increase in the population calculated by subtracting the earlier population from the later is known as absolute increase in population
the rate of increase of population per year is measured in terms of per cent per annum and known as the annual growth rate of population
although india’s population is steadily increasing from  but since  the rate of growth has started to decline gradually
the difference between birth rate and death rate gives a natural increase in population
the number of live birth per thousand persons per year is termed as birth rate
the number of deaths per thousand of persons per year is termed as death rate
migration is the third component of population growth which represent the movement of people from one place to another
when the movement of people occurs within a country it constitutes internal migration but when the movement is between the country it constitutes external or international migration
most migration in india takes place from rural areas to urban areas due to push and pull factors
adverse condition poverty unemployment in rural areas are push factor of migration
greater employment opportunities better living conditioks in the cities are pull factor of migration
the age composition of population of nation is grouped into  categories  children - years adult - years and aged  – above
the number of females per  males in the population is called sex ratio and is an important social indicator to measure the extent of equality between males and females
state of kerala and union territory of puducherry has favourable sex ratio where as delhi and haryana has very adverse sex ratio
a person of  years or above who can read and write and understand any one language is termed as literate
agriculture animal husbandry forestry fishing mining and quarrying are primary occupation
the manufacturing industry building and construction work etc
transport communication commerce administration and other services are tertiary occupations
adolescents constitute one-fifth of the total population of india and adequate attention has to be paid on their nutrition requirements
comprehensive family planning programme in india was started in  and the national population policy npp  is a part of it
npp aims to impart free and compulsory education up to  years reduce the infant mortality rate deal with adolescent-specific problems etc
in india spatial pattern of population distribution is very uneven
as some areas are sparsely populated whereas others are denses
these states can be categorised into three categories  state with high population uttar pradesh highest population maharashtra bihar west bengal madhya pradesh tamil nadu rajasthan karnataka gujarat and andhra pradesh
these states together account for % of population
 states with moderate population assam haryana jharkhand chhattisgarh kerala punjab goa
 states with low population hilly and tribal areas like jammu and kashmir uttarakhand himachal pradesh all north-eastern state except assam and union territories excluding delhi
density of population population density means number of person living in per unit area
according to  census in india  person live in per sq km of area
over the last  years the population density has recorded an increase of about  persons per sq km as ranging from  personssq km in  to  personssq km in 
spatial pattern of population density in india spatial pattern of population density is also uneven in india
for example statesuts having high density of population states bihar  highest west bengal  kerala  uttar pradesh  uts delhi  highest chandigrah 
statesuts having moderate density of population haryana  tamil nadu  punjab  jharkhand  assam  goa  maharashtra  tripura 
uts dadra andnagar haveli 
statesuts having low density of population states arunachal pradesh  lowest mizoram  jammu and kashmir  sikkim  nagaland 
uts andaman and nicobar islands  lowest
its rate is expressed in percentage
two components in population growth afe as follows natural growth it means the change occuring by the births and deaths in any area
induced growth it means the changes occurred by the volume of inward and outward movement in an area
phases of population growth there are four different phases of population growth phase-i - it is stagnant or stationary phase because of very low growth rate
phase-ii - it is the period of steady population growth
phase-iii - this period is known as the period of population explosion in india
rapid fall in death rate and high fertility rate were the main causes of this explosion
phase-iv post  till present growth rate has started down gradually because of downward trend in birth rate
but in developing countries like india growth rate is still high
according to world development report by  indian population will surpass the figure of  million
regional variation in population growth the spatial pattern of population growth in india is very uneven
% negative in nagaland to 
% in dadra and nagar haveli
statesuts having high growth rate of population states meghalaya 
% jammu and kashmir 
uts dadra and nagar haveli 
% daman and diu 
statesuts having moderate growth rate of population chhattisgarh 
statesuts having low growth rate of population states nagaland -
% andaman and nicobar islands 
growth of adolescent population the united nation considers person aged - year as adolescents population
since  the proportion of adolescent population has remained around %
the decadal growth rate of adolescent population of india is 
% as per census 
india is on th place in adolescent population - years after pakistan nigeria and bangladesh
adolescent population has increased from  million in  to 
sex-ratio of adolescent population of india is  females per  males
the government of india has taken many steps by some policies like national youth policy  for channelisation and proper utilisation of adolescents by giving them proper education
rural-urban composition in india its 
% of total population lives in rural villages by 
according to census  india has  villages
percentage of rural population is high in himachal pradesh 
% highest and bihar 
% and low in goa 
delhi has the least rural population 
rural population in indian states states having high proportion of rural population himachal pradesh 
states having moderate proportion of rural population meghalaya 
states having low proportion of rural population states goa 
urban population in indian states regions having high degree of urbanisation states goa 
regions having low degree of urbanisation himachal pradesh 
linguistic composition india is a land of linguistic diversity
according to grierson linguistic survey of india - there were  languages and as many as  dialects in india
but now there are  scheduled languages and number of non-scheduled languages
linguistic classification the speakers of major indian languages belong to four language families which have their sub-families and branches or groups
indo-european aryan-% religious compositions all india religion census data  composition of working population the proportion of working population to total population is called work participation rate
the population of india according to their economic status is divided into three groups like main workers a person who works atleast  days in a year
marginal workers a person who works for less than  days in a year
non-workers a person who does not work and depends upon working class
according to  census it is observed that the proportion of workers both main and marginal is only 
% leaving a vast majority of about % as non-workers
occupational categories the  census has divided the working population of india into four major categories 
as per census  this group reported  million persons % and as per  this group reported 
 migrant by place of last residence if a person’s place of last residence is different from the place of enumeration then he is known as migrant by place of last residence
as per census  this group reported  million migrants  percent
according to  census £
 crore migrants % and settled in a place different from their last residence
streams or types of migration in general there are two types of migration internal migration it refers to the movement of people within a country or nation
this can be intra-state and inter-state migration
there are four streams of migration identified under the internal migration 
rural to rural r-r 
rural to urban r-u 
urban to urban u-u 
urban to rural u-r women migrants are highest in both intra-state and inter-state migration short distance rural to rural migration stream because of their marriage
whereas male migrants are highest in rural to urban streams of inter-state migration due to the economic reasons
international migration it refers to the movement of people out of the country or out of the geopolitical border
india experiences large number of international migration mostly from neighboring countries
as per census  there were more than  million persons reported from other countries in india
 million pakistan – 
 million nepal – 
 million spatial variation in migration in india there is an uneven spatial variation in migration in terms of in-migration and out-migration
states receiving high number of in-migrants maharashtra is the largest migrants receiving state 
besides this delhi gujarat haryana and other urbanised areas attract high number of migrants
states with high out-migrants uttar pradesh -
 million and some other backward states have largest number of net out
urban agglomerations are largely expanding because of high intra-state immigration
greater mumbai received the highest number of in-migrants
causes of migration the reasonscauses of migration can be put under two categories push factors these are factors which urges people to leave their place of residence or origin
some of them are as follows 
natural disaster like flood drought cyclonic storms earthquake tsunami etc
poverty lack of employment opportunities
high population pressure on land
lack of basic infrastructural facilities like health care education etc
pull factors these refers to factors which attract the people from different places
some of them are as follows 
according to an estimation about % males migrate for work and employment whereas only % female migrate for the same reason
but according to census  there is a downfall of 
% as compared to  census
% according to  census of women migrate because of marriage whereas only % males migrate  for the same reason
this migration of males marriage is higher in meghalaya
consequences of migration migration is a consequence of the uneven – distribution of opportunities over space
people  tends to move from place of low opportunity and low safety to the place of higher opportunity and  better safety
results can be observed in i economic social cultural political and demographic terms
economic consequences these consequences are positive as well as negative positive remittances are important for economy of a country
as migrants sent remittances to their family members for food repayment of loansdebts treatment marriages children’s education agricultural inputs construction of houses etc
green revolution in the rural areas of punjab haryana western uttar pradesh was a success because of the migrants from rural areas of ‘ eastern uttar pradesh bihar madhya pradesh and odisha
negative over crowding due to unregulated migration
development of unhygienic slums in industrially developed states like maharashtra gujarat karnataka tamil nadu and delhi
demographic consequences these consequences can be both positive or negative positive redistributing of population within a country
the process of urbanisation is dependent on rural-urban migration
negative imbalance in demographic structure
age and skill selective out migration created an imbalance in demographic structure of rural areas
age and sex-composition is seriously affected in states of uttarakhand rajasthan madhya pradesh and eastern maharashtra due to migration
the same situation happens in the recipient states
social consequences these consequences are both positive as well as negative positive migrants work as an agent of social change
they diffuse new ideas of science and technology family planning girls education etc from one place to another place
people also bring different cultures with them which help to break the narrow considerations and broaden up the mental horizon of the people
negative anonymity increases and creates social vacuum and feeling of ejection
this feeling ultimately results in anti-social activities such as crime drug abuse theft etc
it also results in unplanned and haphazard growth of cities in which slums and shanty colonies are very common
overcrowding is also related to over-exploitation of natural resources and cities are facing serious problems of water shortage air and water pollution problem of sewage disposal and management of solid wastes
other consequences  when male migrants leave their wives in rural areas this puts extra physical and mental pressure on women
the distribution of available opportunities is uneven
a small section of population enjoys all the available modern facilities
on the other hand the marginalised sections include scheduled castes scheduled tribes landless agricultural labourers poor farmers slum dwellers and others which do not have basic amenities even potable water education and health facilities
among all sections women are the most marginalised
with the increasing developmental activities these marginalised sections are becoming even more marginalised and hence are forced to live under abject poverty and sub-human conditions
there is another inter-related aspect of development that has direct role in making human life uncomfortable and cause environmental pollution e
air water soil and noise pollutions
these are leading to the tragedy of commons and threatening the existence of human society
consequently the poor are being subjected to three inter-related processes of declining capabilities they are  social capabilities due to displacement and weakening social ties  environmental capabilities due to increasing in pollution
 personal capabilities due to increasing incidence of diseases and accidents
thus in turn this has adverse effects on their quality of life and human development
human development after seeing the inability of the western or euro-centric view of development to handle the existing issues the concept of human development is brought against this concept
thus human development is a process of widening and providing more choices to people providing them more opportunities for education health care empowerment income and covering all the choices from a healthy physical environment to economic social and political freedom
the first systematic effort in enhancing the human development was made by united nations development programme undp by publishing the first human development report in 
now it is regularity published
undp is responsible for making and amending the indicators to decide the human development of a country
it gives ranks to all member countries on the basis of calculated scores by using indicators and publish them in the report
human development in india according to human development report hdr of  india ranks th with the composite hdi value of 
 medium human development among  member countries of the world
there are many socio-cultural and historical factors which are responsible for the low score condition of human development in india
these are  historical factors these include colonisation imperialism and neo-imperialism
 socio-cultural factors these include violation of human rights social discriminations like race religion gender and caste based discriminations social problems of crimes terrorism and war
 political factors these include political stability and nature of state forms of government level of empowerment etc
planning commission of india also prepares the human development report hdr for india and takes the states and union territories as units for analysis
further the states take districts as their units of analysis
planning commission in its human development report takes the given indicators selected by undp along with other indicators like economic attainment social empowerment social distributive justice accessibility of opportunities hygiene and welfare policies made by the states
indicators of economic attainment economic productivity forms an integral part of human development thus
gross national product gnp and per capita availability are taken as measures to assess the resources baseendowment of any country
on one side india’s gdp at current prices ₹  thousand crores  and its per capita income ₹  are showing an impressive development in india in terms of resource base
but on the other side the existence of poverty deprivation malnutrition illiteracy and different prejudices like caste religion and gender discrimination are showing a different face of economic achievements
variation in per capita income the spatial pattern of per capita income is uneven
 states having low per capita income  less than ₹  per year uttar pradesh bihar odisha madhya pradesh assam jammu and kashmir etc
variation in per capita consumption  there are large regional disparities in terms of per capita consumption
 developed states having high per capita consumption more than ₹  per month are kerala punjab haryana maharashtra gujarat etc
 poor states having low per capita consumption less than ₹  per month are uttar pradesh bihar odisha and madhya pradesh etc
 these variations in both per capita income and consumption are showing some serious problems like poverty unemployment and under-employment
poverty  poverty is a state of deprivation
in absolute terms it reflects the inability of an individual to satisfy certain basic needs for a sustained healthy and reasonably productive living
 in india poverty varies among different states
bihar and odisha population living below poverty line recorded more than % poverty while madhya pradesh sikkim assam tripura arunachal pradesh meghalaya and nagaland recorded more than % of poverty
union territories record poverty less than % are chandigarh daman and diu and delhi
 employment rate for educated youth is only %
jobless growth and rampant unemployment are some of the major causes responsible for poverty in india
indicators of healthy life healthy and long life is important for everyone and it is measured by availability of adequate health facilities to decrease infant deaths post delivery deaths of mothers old age health care proper nutrition and safety of people
the health indicators are  mortality rate india has been successful in declining mortality rate from 
 per thousand in  to 
 per thousand in 
infant mortality rate is also declined from  per thousand in  to  per thousand in 
 average life expectancy rate it is increased from 
 years for males 
 for females during -
 in  to 
but it is still higher as compared to developed countries
 sex-ratio sex-ratio in india is declining after every decade
according to  census the findings are very disturbing particularly in case of child sex ratio between - age group
except kerala highest sex-ratio all the states have the declining trend in child-sex ratio
for example haryana and punjab have the child sex ratio below  female children on per thousand male children according to  census child sex ratio decline against  from  to 
indicators of social empowerment  freedom from hunger poverty servitude bondage ignorance illiteracy and other forms of domination is the key to human development
 empowerment and participation of the people by using their capabilities and choices in the society leads to actual freedom
 people can use their capabilities and choices by understanding the society and environment
this can happen through literacy as it opens the door of a world of knowledge and freedom
literacy in india  according to  census india’s literacy is about 
% while its female literacy is 
% according to  
% is total literacy rate of these 
% are males and females respectively
 percentage of total literacy and female literacy are higher than the national average in most of the southern states
 literacy rate is low in bihar 
% and high in kerala 
it shows a large regional disparities in context of literacy in india
 literacy rate is low in rural areas in some marginalised sections of our society like females schedule castes schedule tribes agricultural labourers etc
inspite of having some improved condition in literacy rate in these section there is still a wide gap between the rich and the marginalised sections
human development index in india human development report in india is prepared annually by the institute of applied manpower research in the supervision of planning commission by taking states and union territories as the unit of study
states with high hdi value are kerala highest hdi among indian states i
 delhi himachal pradesh goa and punjab whereas chhattisgarh odisha and bihar lowest hdi among indian states with 
 recorded as lowest hdi value
higher number of literates is the main reason for kerala having high hdi value
on the other hand bihar odisha madhya pradesh assam and uttar pradesh have low composite value of hdi because of their lowest literacy rate
economic development also has very important role in hdi
economically developed states like maharastatra tamil nadu and punjab have higher value of hdi as compared to states like chhattisgarh bihar madhya pradesh
historical reasons are also responsible for having high or low human development e
regional imbalances and social disparities which emerged under the british period are still crucial in determining the level of development because they are still affecting the political economical and social system in india
despite of having planned development by the government the most important goals are still far away from the ideal level
population environment and development development is important because it improves quality of life but simultaneously brought many problems like regional disparities social inequalities discriminations deprivations displacement of people violation of human rights and declining human values and environmental degradation
undp in its human development report of  tried to amend these issues and found an important role of civil societies in bringing about peace and human development
these civil societies can help by building up opinion for reduction in military expenditure demobilisation of armed forces transition from defense to production of basic goods and services and reduction in the nuclear weapons in developed countries
the view of these approaches are presented by neomalthusians environmentalists and radical ecologists
these thinkers argued to maintain a balance between population and resources before starting any developmental activity
sir robert malthus was the first scholar who drew the attention towards the imbalance between population and resources
along with the problem of the scarcity of resources and growing population there was another problem of unevenly distributed resources over the space and their accessibility only by few rich countries and people
so there were conflicts between rich and poor countries for these unevenly distributed resources
along with malthus mahatama gandhi was also a supporter of balance and harmony between population and resources
according to him industrialisation has institutionalised the loss of morality spirituality self-reliance non-violence and mutual co-operation and environment
further gandhiji says that higher goals in the life of a person or by a nation can be achieved through the austerity for individual trusteeship of social wealth and non-violence
the people of these settlements are mainly engaged in primary activities like agriculture fishing mining etc e
people surviving in hamlets and villages
factors determining the rural settlements there are various factors and conditions responsible for having different types of rural settlements in india
these are  physical features these include nature of terrain altitude climate and availability of water
 cultural and ethnic factors these include social structure caste and religion
 security factors these include defence against thefts and robberies
types of rural settlements types of the rural settlements are determined by the above determinants as well as by the extent of the built up area and inter-house distance
in india rural settlements can broadly divided into four types  clustered agglomerated or nucleated  semi-dustered or fragmented  hamleted and  dispersed or isolated clustered settlements  the houses in this settlement are closely spaced or have no space between houses
 the living place is distinct and separated from the surrounding farms bams and pastures
 the settlement sometimes present distinct patterns or geometrical shapes like rectangular radial linear etc which are recognisable in fertile alluvial plains and north-eastern states
 this type of settlement is built due to various reasons e
in bundelkhand and nagaland people live in these settlements for defence and security purposes in rajasthan these settlements are built around near water resources due to water scarcity
 here a dominant community captures the most important part in main village and force other communities to live away
plains of gujarat and rajasthan
hamleted settlement  this type of settlement is formed due to social or ethnic factors and thus known for different identity and name like panna para nagla dhani etc
 each hamlet is a unit and has a number of houses
 several units of hamlets collectively form a village
middle and lower ganga plain chhattisgarh and lower valleys of himalayas
dispersed settlements  isolated huts or hamlets of few huts in remote jungles or on small hills with farms or pastures are characteristics of dispersed type of settlement
 these houses may be of temporary use
it is found in meghalaya uttaranchal himachal pradesh kerala etc
urban settlements  unlike rural settlement urban settlement are usually more dense compact and larger in size
 here people are mostly engaged in non-agricultural activities i
industries services administrative functions etc
 cities and towns both are connected directly or indirectly with villages and also with each other and exchange goods services and also commute
evolution of towns in india the evolution of towns started in india from prehistoric times e
harappa mohenjodaro towns european colonies of modern period etc
indian towns may be classified into three groups on the basis of their evolution in different periods ancient towns these towns were developed over  years ago by the various kings as religious and cultural centres e
varanasi prayag allahabad pataliputra patna madurai etc
 these towns are about  in numbers and were generally fort towns which came up on the ruins of ancient towns
 for example delhi hyderabad jaipur lucknow agra and nagpur
modern towns these towns were developed by the britishers and other europeans in india
these are further divided into the following groups  port towns these are located on the coastal areas of india i
surat daman goa puducherry etc
 administrative towns these were developed for the administrative purposes e
mumbai bombay chennai madras and kolkata calcutta
 industrial towns after  these towns were developed like jamshedpur
 some other towns of european styles these towns include hill stations for summer resorts military towns and small towns for administrative purposes
towns after independence after independence some towns were also developed like  administrative headquarters or capital of states these towns include chandigarh bhubaneshwar gandhinagar and dispur etc
 industrial townscentres these towns include durgapur bhilai sindri barani etc
 satellite towns these were old towns which developed around metropolitan cities such as ghaziabad rohtak gurgaon gurugram etc
 medium and small towns these are developed due to increasing investment in rural areas
urbanisation in india  urbanisation is the transition of rural population into urban population
 it is measured by the percentage of urban population into total population
in india the level of urbanisation is very low as it was just % in 
 developed countries have a higher level of urbanisation than india
 although urbanisation in india is increasing with high rate as it increased  times dining twentieth century but this process is comparatively slow during recent two decades
cities and urban areas are classified into six classes by census of india
urban areas use their population size as base
thus an urban area that have population of more than one lakh is considered as city or class i town
cities that have population more than one million but less than  million are considered as metropolitan or metro city
cities that have population more than  million are considered as ‘megacities’ or ‘megalopolis’
the six classes of towns are given below apart from these cities there is also a concept of urban agglomeration in india
according to census of india an urban agglomeration may have to fulfil anyone of the following conditions 
a town and its adjoining urban out growths
two or more contiguous towns with or without their outgrowths
a city and one or more adjoining towns with their outgrowths together forming a contiguous spread
examples of these outgrowth may be in the form of railway colonies university campus part area military cantonment etc
according to the given table class iv cities are highest in number but larger proportion of urban population lives in class i cities 
besides these towns india has  cities
among them  cities or urban agglomeration are metropolitan cities
six of them are mega cities with population over  million each
greater mumbai being the largest urban agglomeration with 
 million population followed by kolkata delhi chennai bengaluru and hyderabad
government offices and departments etc are mainly concentrated in these cities
chandigarh new delhi bhopal shilong guwahati imphal srinagar gandhinagar jaipur and chennai etc
 industrial towns these towns cities mainly dominated by industries
jamshedpur bhilai durgapur madurai mumbai etc
 transport cities transportation is the main function of these cities
port towns are examples of these towns that are always busy in transporting commodities to other cities
kandla kochchi kozhikode visakhapatnam etc
there are some cities which are hubs of inland transport such as agra dhulia mughal sarai itarsi katni etc
 commercial towns the important functions of these towns are trade and commerce
 mining towns these towns have developed in mineral rich areas
raniganj jharia digboi ankaleshwar singrauli etc
 garrison cantonment towns these towns are meant for the army or defence purpose
ambala jalandhar mhow babina udhampur etc
 educational towns initially these towns were important education centres but later they emerged as major campus towns
roorkee varanasi aligarh pilani allahabad etc
 religious and cultural towns these towns are famous for pilgrimage religious worship or old cultures
varanasi mathura amritsar madurai pune ajmer tirupati kurukshetra haridwar ujjain etc
 tourists towns these towns are famous for attracting wide range of tourists from india and all over the world
nainital mussoorie shimla pachmarhi jodhpur jaisalmer udagamandalam ooty mount abu etc
the functions of these cities are not fix and change with the time as cities are dynamic in nature
with increase in population cities become metropolis and multi-functional i
industry business administration transport etc
thus classification of these cities on the basis of specialised function is impossible as all the functions are interlinked
under the land revenue records land use categories are as follows 
land put to non-agricultural uses
area under permanent pastures and grazing lands
area under miscellaneous tree crops and groves
net sown area land use changes in india unlike other natural resources land is fixed it does not change by size or area
economic activities are the major causes that affect land use
the three main economic changes that changes the land use are 
the size of the economy
the composition of an economy proportion of different sectors
increasing pressure on agricultural lands
during the period of - to - some land use changes are worth mentioning which show an increase and decrease in these categories area records increase in land use  area under forest
 area under non-agricultural use
area records decrease in land use  barren and wasteland
 fallow other than current fallow
on the basis of ownership land can be classified into two categories private land owned by individual or group of individuals
common property resources cprs available for all and can be used by any person
it provides fodder for the livestock and fuel for the households
in rural areas such land is of particular relevance for livelihood of the landless and marginal farmers
agricultural land use in india most of the indians are dependent on agriculture directly or indirectly for their subsistence
agriculture is mainly land-based activity unlike secondary and tertiary sectors
the role of quality of land is important in agriculture
the more the land is fertile the more it gives outputproduction
ownership of land resource is considered as a social status in rural areas
it is also seen as security for credit natural hazards or life contingencies
availability of total resources for agricultural uses is calculated by adding up net sown area all fallow lands and culturable wastelands
cropping intensity cl’is calculated as follows cropping intensity in percentage = gca gross cropped areansa net sown area x  cropping seasons in india types of farming in india farming is classified on the basis of moisture available for crops  irrigated farming the main source of moisture for this farming is irrigation by various methods i
two types are protective and productive farming
 rainfed farming barani the main source of moisture for this farming is rainfall
two types are dryland farming and wetland farming
these regions grows hardy and drought resistant crops such as ragi bajra moong gram and gaur
on the other hand in wetland farming the rainfall is in excess of soil moisture requirement of plants during rainy season
such regions may face flood and soil erosion hazards
these areas grow various water intensive crops such as rice jute and sugercane
cropping pattern food grains foodgrains are important for agriculture economy which constitute about two-third of total cropped area in the country
the foodgrains are classified on the basis of structure of grains cereals india ranks rd in the production of cereals after china and usa
india produces % of the world and covers about % of the total cropped area in india
these cereals are  rice it is the most important food crop of india which feeds more than half of our population
india ranked second with the production nearly % after china in the world
states like west bengal punjab and uttar pradesh were major rice producing states in india
himalyas regions it is grown as a kharif crop whereas in west bengal farmers grow three crops of rice called ‘aus’ ‘aman’ and ‘boro’
 wheat india share % of total wheat production of the world
it is cultivated on about % of the total cropped area
about % of this area comes under the indo-gangetic plain malwa plateau and himalayas in north and central parts of the country
the major wheat producing states of india are uttar pradesh punjab haryana rajasthan and madhya pradesh bihar and jammu and kashmir
coarse grains these crops are grown in almost 
% of total cropped area in the country
% of total cropped area
maharashtra is the largest producer of jowar in india
the major producer of jowar are central and southern states i
karnataka madhya pradesh and andhra pradesh
 bajra it is grown in about 
% of the total cropped area in the country
the major producers of bajra are maharashtra gujarat uttar pradesh rajasthan and haryana
 maize it is grown in about 
% of total cropped area in the country
there is no particular region under maize
it is sown all over india except eastern and north eastern regions
the leading producers are madhya pradesh andhra pradesh telangana karnataka rajasthan and uttar pradesh
india is one of the largest producers of pulses as it cultivates about % pulses of the world
these are largely confined to the drylands of deccan and central plateaus and north- western parts of the country
 gram it is grown in 
% of the total cropped area
the major producers are madhya pradesh uttar pradesh maharashtra andhra pradesh and rajasthan
 tur arhar this is grown in % of the total cropped area of india
it is the second important pulse crop in the country
maharashtra is the leading producer of tur which produces about % of tur in india
it is also called as red gram or pigeon pea
 oil seeds oil seeds are produced for extracting edible oils
oil seeds include groundnut 
% rapeseed and mustard 
these different oilseeds are grown in india about % of total cropped area in the country
drylands of malwa plateau maharashtra gujarat rajasthan telangana and rayalseema of andhra pradesh and karnataka plateau are leading producers of oilseeds
soybean and sunflower are other important oil seeds grown in india
fibre crops fibre crops are one which provides fibre for preparing cloth
these includes  cotton india grows both short staple indian cotton as well as long staple american cotton
% of the world’s cotton
this makes india the fourth largest producer of cotton after china usa and pakistan
largest producers of cotton in india are maharashtra gujarat andhra pradesh punjab and haryana
 jute india accounts for about % of the world’s jute production
west bengal % is the largest producer of jute in the country
other producers are bihar and assam
other crops  sugarcane it is an important cash crop in india
india’s sugarcane production is about % of the world’s total production which makes india the nd largest producer after brazil
major producers are uttar pradesh maharashtra and gujarat
uttar pradesh accounts  percent of sugarcane production and secures a position of the largest producer of india
% is the largest producer of tea in india
other states are west bengal and tamil nadu
 coffee india is the th largest producer of coffee in the world which accounts about 
karnataka is the largest producer of coffee that produces more than % of india’s total coffee
% of population is engaged in agricultural activity
according to census  and about % of its land is used for cultivation of various crops in india whereas world average is only about %
 the land-human ratio in india is only 
 hectare whereas the world is almost double of this figure i
strategy of development before independence indian agriculture was largely subsistence in nature this period was frequently witnessed severe droughts famines and food shortage
about lrd of the irrigated area went to pakistan
consequently government took several steps to increase the production of food grains
following three strategies were adopted to achieve this goal 
switching over from cash crops to food crops
intensification of cropping over already cultivated land
increasing cultivated area by bringing cultivable and fallow land under plough
however indian agriculture could not progress much then government introduced modem technology into agriculture
these were  high yielding variety hyv of seeds  fertilisers  mechanisation  improved irrigation and credit marketing facilities
 intensive area development programme all the above inputs were the main components of what is known as green revolution
this strategy of agricultural development in the country made the country self-reliant in foodgrain production
but green revolution was initially confined to irrigated areas only
this led to regional disparities in agricultural development in the country till the seventies
consequently planning commission prepared plans to solve the problems of agriculture in rainfed areas in s
it initiated agro- climate planning in  to induce regional balance
growth of agricultural output and technology  since independence there has been improvement in technologies used for agricultural production
as a result increase in agricultural production has been recorded
 india is now became st largest producer of pulses and jute and nd largest in rice wheat groundnut sugarcane and vegetables
hyv seeds chemical fertilisers raised  folds since mid s
problems of indian agriculture these problems are  dependence on erratic monsoon there is only % cultivated area is under irrigation
the nature of south-west monsoon is very fluctuating which causes flood and drought situation in india
 low productivity india also lag behind in terms of per hectare production and per person production and also behind at international level
this low productivity is a result of high population which creates a heavy pressure on available land resources
 constraints of financial resources and indebtedness lack of money and financial resources are the major constraints to the development of agriculture in india
as majority of farmers are small marginal and poor they cannot afford highly expensive inputs to increase their production
 lack of land reforms lack of land reforms and unequal distribution of land resources led to the worst condition of poor and marginal farmers and also become constraint in the development of agriculture in india
 small farm size and fragmentation of landholdings ‘inheritance law’ is mainly responsible for small and fragmented farm size
 lack of commercialisation as most of the farmers are poor and marginal farmers practice subsistence agriculture for their living
 vast under-employment there is seasonal unemployment in agricultural sector
there is no income during ploughing field to harvesting crops
 degradation of cultivable land after green revolution degradation has started in india
excessive use of irrigation chemical fertilizers etc created problems of water lodging and solemnization
fertility of land is also decreasing day by day
% world’s geographical area the % of the world’s water resources and about % of world population
 cubic km and surface and groundwater sources i
but only %  cubic km from these two sources of water are beneficial and usable
surface water resources  river lakes ponds and tanks are four main sources of surface water resources in india
 about  number of river and tributaries existed here and each tributary is more than 
 the mean annual flow in all the river basin in india is estimated to be  cubic km
but only about  cubic km or % of these water can be utilised due to topographical hydrological and other constraints
 size of catchment areariver basin and rainfall in its catchment area control the flow of water in a river
water availability in rivers is more during monsoon than other seasons in india
 in india ganga brahmaputra and indus have large catchment area
catchment areas of ganga and brahmaputra and barak rivers fall into the high rainfall receiving area thus have % of total water resources and have only % of the surface areas in india but most of the water is not utilised
 on the other hand in the peninsular rivers like godavari krishna kaveri etc mean annual flow of water is less but much of their water resources has been utilised
groundwater resources  there is about  cubic km of total replenishable ground water resources available in india
ganga and brahmaputra basins have about % of the total replenishable groundwater resources
 the level of groundwater utilisation is relatively high in the river basins of north¬western parts and southern parts of india
 states having very high utilisation of groundwater are punjab haryana rajasthan and tamil nadu
 states having moderate utilisation ground water are gujarat uttar pradesh bihar tripura and maharashtsa
 states having low utilisation of groundwater are chhattisgarh odisha kerala etc
lagoons and backwaters  some states of india have indented coastline and thus a number of lagoons and lakes have formed
examples of such states are kerala odisha and west bengal
 due to brackish water-bodies these water resources are used for fishing and irrigating certain varieties of paddy crops coconut etc
water demand and utilisation  agriculture being an important part of indian economy alone uses about % of surface water and % of groundwater
 most of the developmental projects river valley projects like the bhakra-nangal hirakund damodar valley nagaijuna sagar indira gandhi canal project etc as well as five year plans were started to provide water to agricultural sector and increase agricultural production
 besides this utilisation of surface and groundwater for domestic purposes are % and % and for industrial sector are % and % respectively
demand of water for irrigation  need for irrigation is very high in india due to the spatial and temporal variation of rainfall
 as winter and summer season are more or less dry in most parts of india
so without irrigation agriculture cannot be practised in these parts
 some crops like rice sugarcane jute and other are water intensive and require more water to grow
 irrigation helps to grow multiple crops gives more agricultural productivity and along with hyv seeds gives more yield at fast rate
punjab haryana and western uttar pradesh which have more than % of net source area under irrigation
 total net irrigated area in punjab under wells and tube wells is 
% where as it is 
these states utilise a large share of their groundwater resources and thus it is the major cause behind the depletion of these resources
 besides these in rajasthan and bihar the concentration of flouride in groundwater is also increasing due to over withdrawal of this resource
whereas in west bengal and bihar the concentration of arsenic has been increased because of the same reason
 the per capita availability of water in india is also decreasing day by day
deterioration of water quality  water quality means water free from unwanted foreign substances that make water polluted i
 these toxic substances are responsible for water pollution by dissolving or he suspended in lakes streams rivers and oceans
 sometimes such pollutants seep down and pollute groundwater
the most polluted rivers in india are ganga and yamuna
water conservation and management  the conservation and management of water become necessary after decreasing the availability of fresh water and increasing its demand by increasing population
 for sustainable development and maintaining the quality of life the government should encourage people to adopt watershed development rainwater harvesting recycling and reuse of water conjunctive use of water for availability of quality water for long time
prevention of water pollution  availability of water resources are shrinking with a faster rate
it is seen that hilly areas have less dense population and thus have high quality of water in their rivers
whereas plains have dense population and thus have low quality of water in their rivers and here water is widely used for irrigation domestic works and industrial works
 plains also contribute more in polluting water sources by draining agricultural wastes chemical fertilisers and insecticides solid and domestic wastes and industrial wastes
 during summer concentration of pollutants in rivers remains high because of low amount of water which unable to flow these pollutants
 water quality of national aquatic resources at  stations have been monitored by the central pollution control board cpcb with the collaboration of state pollution control boards
other severely polluted rivers are the sabarmati at allahabad the gomti at lucknow the kali the adyar the cooum at entire stretches the vaigai at madurai musi at hyderabad and the ganga at kanpur and varanasi
 ground water is also polluted because of high concentration of heavy toxic metals flouride nitrates at different parts of the country
legislative provisions and laws to prevent river pollution  government has taken various steps to minimise river and water pollution but due to some obstacles these were proved to be less effective for e
water prevention and control of pollution act of  and environment protection act of  were unsuccessful as in   polluting factories were established along the rivers and lakes
 the water cess act of  which was made to prevent pollution was also less effective
so there is an urgent need to create awareness in public about the importance of water in life
it will result in reducing the pollutants from agricultural activities and industrial discharge
recycle and reuse of water  recycle and reuse is a simple and best way to conserve fresh water and make it available for all
 industries can use water of low quality and their waste water for cooling and fire fighting which can decrease the cost of water for them and conserve fresh water
 water could be collected after bathing and washing utensils washing clothes and cars can be a better option for gardening
 today reusing and recycling of water is limited to few people but there is enormous scope for replenishing water through recycling
watershed management watershed management basically refers to efficient management and conservation of surface water
storage and recharge of ground-water by different methods such as percolation tanks recharge wells etc
the conservation regeneration and judicious use of all natural resources land water plants and animals and human resources
create a balance among natural elements as well as in society
community participation is a key to success of a watershed development programme
there are various watershed development and management programmes started by both central and state government at national and state level in india like  haryali it is sponsered by the central government while gram panchayats of different villages execute it with the public participation
this programme enabled people to conserve water for various uses such as drinking irrigation fisheries and afforestation
 neeru-meeru water and you programme in andhra pradesh and arvary pani sansad in alwar rajasthanare examples of state initiated watershed development programmes
under these two programmes numerous percolation tanks dug out ponds johad check dams etc were constructed for harvesting water with the help of public participation
tamil nadu is only state which has made the construction of water harvesting structures compulsory in the houses
the construction of a building without the structure of water harvesting is not allowed
despite having such programmes still most of the people in india are not aware with the benefits of watershed development and managment of water
thus there is a need to encourage more people to participate in this programme
rain water harvesting rain water harvesting is a cheap and environmental friendly technique that guides us to store rainwater into bore wells pits and also recharge groundwater aquifers for different uses
there are various benefits of rainwater harvesting which are as follows 
checks the declining groundwater level
it improves the quality of groundwater by dilution of pollutions like fluoride and nitrates
it prevents soil erosion and flooding
it can be used to arrest salt water intrusion in coastal areas if used to recharge aquifers
there are numerous methods to harvest rain water in india
in traditional rain water harvesting techniques water is usually collected in any surface water body i
lakes ponds irrigation tanks etc of rural areas
another technique is kund or tanka which is a covered storage under ground tank
this technique is widely used in rajasthan
other methods  to solve the problem of water scarcity we can use brackish water of arid semi-arid and coastal areas after the desalinised processes
 by interlinking of rivers water can be transferred from the water surplus areas to water deficit areas
highlights of india’s national water policy   the national water policy  stipulates water allocations priorities broadly in the following order i
drinking water irrigation hydro-power navigation industrial and other uses
 the main objectives of this policy are to provide water to all human beings and animals regular monitoring of surface and ground water quality create awareness of water as a scarce resource create conservation consciousness among people through education regulation incentives and disincentives etc
copper bauxite iron manganese etc
these are of two types  ferrous minerals these are rich in iron contents and an important source of iron
 non-ferrous minerals these do not have iron content and have highest proportion of other metals
non-metallic minerals these minerals do not have contents of metals
their distribution over the earth surface are uneven
there is inverse relationship in quantity and quality of minerals i
good quality minerals are less in quantity as compared to low quality minerals
once they used can not replenished immediately at the time of need
so minerals have to be conserved and used judiciously
distribution of minerals in india  most of metallic minerals in india occur in the peninsular plateau region in the old crystalline rocks
 river valleys of damodar sone mahanadi and godavari have over % of coal reserves in india
 sedimentary basins of assam and offshore region in the arabian sea gujarat and mumbai high are famous for their crude petroleum reserves

agriculture industry transport are run by power which comes from mineral fuels whether conventional or non-conventional energy resources
conventional sources of energy these are exhaustible in nature e
fossil fuels like coal petroleum and natural gas
coal  it is required in the generation of thermal power and smelting of iron-ore
 india has about % of bituminous coal which is of non-cooking grade
 it is found in two rock sequences i
gondwana coal fields and tertiary coal fields
gondwana coal fields damodar valley is the important coal field of india
jharkhand and west bengal coal have the entire area of this coal field
jharia largest coal field raniganj second fields largest bokaro giridih karanpura are important coal fields of this valley
other river valleys are godavari mahanadi and sone

petroleum crude petroleum consists of hydrocarbons of liquid and gaseous states varying in chemical composition colour and specific gravity
it is used as a source of energy in all internal combustion engines of automobiles railways and aircrafts
it is also used as a raw material in petrochemical industries to produce fertilizer synthetic rubber synthetic fibre medicines vaseline lubricants wax soap and cosmetics etc
it is also called liquid gold due to the scarcity and different uses
crude oil is found in sedimentary rocks of tertiary age
before independence digboi was the only crude oil producing region in india but after independence in  oil and natural gas commission was set up
important oil producing regions are  assam digboi naharkatiya and moran
krishna godavari and kaveri basin also have oil and natural gas reserves on the east coast of india
there are two types of oil refineries in india  field based refineries digboi is an example of field based refinery
 market based refineries barauni is an example of market based refinery
there are total  refineries as on june 
natural gas  it occurs alongwith oil as well as separately in gas reserves in india
 these gas reserves are located alongwith eastern cost of tamil nadu odisha andhra pradesh tripura rajasthan gujarat and maharashtra
 gujarat and maharashtra have off-shore wells of natural gas
 according to a survey report there are indications of huge gas reserves in ramathanpuram in tamilnadu state
non-conventional energy sources  unlike conventional sources of energy non-conventional energy sources are renewable i
solar wind hydro-geothermal and biomass and are not threat to natural system
 their use ensure sustainable development as these are environment friendly and cheaper energy sources
nuclear energy sources  nuclear energy has emerged as a feasible source in recent times
 uranium and thorium are main minerals that are used to generate nuclear energy
uranium deposits in india it is found in dharwar rock system
important regions are  jharkhand singbhum alongwith the copper belt  rajasthan udaipur alwar jhunjhunu districts
 chhattisgarh durg district maharastra bhandara district
 himachal pradesh kullu district
 odisha mahanadi river delta these three states have world’s richest monazite deposits
the development of nuclear energy was started after establishment of atomic energy institute at trombay in  which was renamed as the bhabha atomic research centre in 
tarapur maharashtra rawatbhata near kota rajasthan kalapakkam tamil nadu narora uttar pradesh kaiga karnataka and kakarapara gujarat are other nuclear power sites in india
solar energy  sun’s energy trapped by two methods i
photovoltaic cells and solar thermal technology and convert into electricity is called solar energy
 its construction is easy eco-friendly and cost competitive
 it is % and % more effective than coal and oil based plants and nuclear energy respectively
 heaters dryers cookers and other heating appliances use solar energy more than others
 gujarat rajasthan and the western part of india have higher potential for the development of solar energy
wind energy  wind energy is non-polluting and renewable source
through turbine mechanism kinetic energy of wind can be directly converted into electrical energy
 electricity can be produced by permanent wind systems like trade wind westerlies or seasonal winds like monsoon winds
besides production of electricity can also be done by local winds land and sea breezes
 india already has started generating wind energy to lessen the burden of oil import bill
it is estimated that india has  megawatts potential of wind generation of which one- fourth may be easily employed
 rajasthan gujarat maharashtra and karnataka have higher potential for the development of wind energy
large tidal waves are known to occur along the west coast of india
 many efforts for the efficient use of oceanic tides and waves were made since th and th century
 but these waves have not yet been utilised properly because of lack of technology’
geothermal energy  magma that comes over the earth’ surface releases vast amount of heat
this heat energy can be converted into electrical energy by tapping it
it is called geothermal energy  main sources of this energy are magma hot spring hot water hot geysers etc
 geothermal energy is gaining importance and can be used as an alternative to conventional energy sources
 in india at manikaran in himachal pradesh a geothermal energy plant has been commissioned
bio-energy  bio-energy refers to energy derived from biological products which includes agricultural residues municipal industrial and other wastes
 it can be converted into electricity or electrical energy heat energy or gas for cooking food
 this can also solve the problem of garbage and waste in urban areas because energy can also be derived from these
 it can contribute in improving economic life of rural peoples in developing countries increasing environmental problems like pollution solid waste management enhancing self- reliance and reducing pressure on fuel wood
 a project in okhla delhi is an example that generates energy from municipal waste
conservation of mineral resources there are some methods through which we can conserve mineral resources 
adoption of renewable resources in place of exhaustible resources like solar power wind geothermal energy can save our non-renewable resources
use of recycle scrap metals should be encouraged
use of substitutes for scarce metals may also reduce their consumption
export of strategic and scarce minerals must be reduced so that the existing reserve may be used for a longer period
mall scale and cottage industries on the basis of ownership 
joint and cooperative sector on the basis of use of finished goods 
consumers goods industries on the basis of raw materials used by them 
industrially processed raw material based industries on the basis of nature of the manufactured products 
chemical and allied industries 
communication industries location of industries  location of industries is determined by important factors i
raw materials power resources water labour markets and the transport facilities
 raw materials and industries are inter-related to each other
most of the manufacturing industries are located at a place where cost of production and cost of delivery of finished goods are least
 nature of raw materials and finished goods decide the cost of transportation
factors of industrial location the following factors influence the location of industries raw materials  industries using raw materials which are perishable or lose weight in the process of manufacture are usually located near the source of the raw materials
 for example sugar mills pulp industries copper smelting pig iron industries etc
 iron and steel industries are mostly located near coalfields e
bokaro durgapur  or near source of iron-ore bhadravati bhilai rourkela as both iron-ore and coal lose their weight during the process of manufacturing of steel
power  power is must for every industry so supply of power should be ensured before locating any industry
aluminum and synthetic nitrogen manufacturing industries
market  market is an important factor for market oriented industries as market provide outlets for manufactured products like heavy machines machine tools heavy chemicals to sell finished goods
transport  it is important for the location of industries to move goods and labour from industrial area to markets and others
 for example around delhi mumbai chennai and kolkata the concentration of industries is maximum
labour  it is another important factor of the location of industries
 due to our large population labour is quite mobile and is available in large numbers
historical factors colonial influence like competition from the british goods and the british discriminatory policies are also important reasons for the emergence of some of our industrial nodes like mumbai kolkata and chennai and manufacture centres like murshidabad dhaka bhadohi surat vadodara kozhikode coimbatore mysore etc
to bring balanced regional development and to eradicate regional disparities in the economy are the main objectives of our democratic country
india attempts to promote backward areas like tribal areas into economic development process by providing lots of incentives
for example establishment of iron and steel industry in bhilai and rourkela were based on decision to develop backward tribal areas of the country
major industries some of the major industries of our country are discussed below the iron and steel industry the iron and steel industry provides basic infrastructure to almost all sectors of the indian industry
the raw materials used in this industry iron-ore cooking coal limestone dolomite manganese and fire clay are found in parts of chhattisgarh northern odisha jharkhand and western west bengal
this industry comprises of large integrated steel plants as well as mini steel mills and also includes secondary producers rolling mills and ancillary industries
this industry gets its raw materials from different source regions like 
water supply from subamarekha and kharkai rivers
iron-ore from noamundi and badam pahar
coal from joda mines in odisha
coking coal from coal fields of jharia and west bokaro
iisco the first factory of the indian iron and steel company iisco was set-up at hirapur and another at kulti
in  the steel corporation of bengal was established in association with iisco by setting up another unit at bunpur west bengal
iisco gets its raw materials from different source regions like 
coal from damodar valley coal fields raniganj jharia and ramgarh
iron-ore from singhbhum in jharkhand
water supply from river barakar a tributary of damodar river
the kolkata- asansol railway line runs along the plants
later in - the government took over the iisco plant because of the fall of steel production
visvesvaraiya iron and steel works ltd
visl initially named mysore iron and steel works the visl is located at the banks of badravati in shimoga district of karnataka
this plant produces specialised steels and alloys
visl gets raw materials from 
it gets iron ore from kemangundi in the bababudan hills limestone and manganese from the local area
water supply from the bhadravati river
due to unavailability of coal in this region at the beginning charcoal was used as fuel by burning wood till 
later electric furnaces were installed which use hydroelectricity from the jog falls hydel power project
during the second five years plan - three new public sector integrated steel plants were set up with foreign collaboration i
rourkela in odisha bhilai in chhattisgarh and durgapur in west bengal
in  the steel authority of india limited sail was created to manage these plants
rourkela steel plant this plant was established in  in the sundargarh district of odisha in collaboration with germany
this plant gets its raw materials from different sources region like 
iron-ore from sundargarh and kendujhar districts
hydro-electric power from hirakud power project
water from koel and sankh rivers
bhilai steel plant it was set up with russian collaboration in durg district of chhattisgarh and started production in 
it gets its raw material from different places like 
coal from korba and kargali
power from korba thermal power station
this plant is connected with kolkata-mumbai railway line
this plant supplies the bulk of steel to the hindustan shipyard at vishakhapatnam
durgapur steel plant it was set up in
collaboration with the government of united kingdom in west bengal and started production in 
it gets its raw material from the following places 
coal from jharia and raniganj
water and hydel power from damodar valley corporation dvc
it lies on the main kolkata-delhi railway route
bokaro steel plant bokaro steel plant was set up in  with russian collaboration at bokaro
it aims at transport cost minimisation by creating bokaro-roukela combine
water and hydel power from damodar valley corporation dvc
other raw materials come from within a radius of about  km
other steel plants in the fourth five year plan three new steel plants were set up away from the main raw materials sources namely 
the vizag steel plant in vishakhapatnam in andhra pradesh is the first port based plant which started operating in 
the vijayanagar steel plant at hospet in karnataka
the salem steel plant in tamil nadu was commissioned in 
there are also more than  units in india which use scrap iron as main raw material and process it in electric furnaces
the cotton textile industry this industry is one of the traditional industries of india
the first successful modem cotton textile mill was established in mumbai in 
beause it is very close to the cotton producing areas of gujarat and maharashtra and being a large town provide employment opportunities to many people
after the first mill two more mills the shahpur mill and the calico mill were established in ahmedabad gujarat
but after partition india was left with  mills out of  mills and only % of the cotton progrowing area
the decentralised sector includes cloth produced in handlooms including khadi and powerlooms
now powerlooms on the decentralised sector produce more than the handloom sector
as cotton does not lose weight in the manufacturing process hence the location of cotton textile industry is determined by other factors like power supply labour capital or market
at present market is the most preferred factor to locate industry as market decides what is the current trend of clothes
after first cotton textile mills were set up in mumbai and ahmedabad the cotton textile industry expanded very rapidly
development of the railway network also contributed to the expansion of mills
in southern india mills were set up at coimbatore madurai and bangaluru
in central india mills were set up at nagpur indore solapur and vadodra
mills were also set up at kanpur and kolkata
availability of cheap labour favoured the setting up of cotton mills at ujjain bharuch agra hathras coimbatore and tirunelveli
distribution of cotton textile industries  in present time important centres of cotton textile industries are ahmedabad bhiwandi solapur kolhapur nagpur indore and ujjain
maharashtra gujarat and tamil nadu are the leading cotton producing states
west bengal uttar pradesh karnataka and punjab are the other important cotton textile producers
 tamil nadu has largest number of mills and most of them produce yam rather than cloth
coimbatore accounts for % of total mills
other important centres are chennai madura tirunelveli tuticorin thanjavur ramanathapuram and salem
 in karnataka bengaluru hubli devangera bellary mysore are some important centres
 the cotton textile industry has developed in cotton producing telangana region
the important centres are hyderabad secunderabad and warangal in telangana and guntur in andhra pradesh
 most of the cotton textile industry has developed in the western part of uttar pradesh
kanpur is the largest centre and known as manchester of uttar pradesh
other important centres are agra modinagar sahranpur lucknow and hathras
 in west bengal important centres are kolkata serampur howrah and shyamnagar
 cotton textile industry has been facing tough competition from synthetic cloth
sugar industry the sugar industry being the second largest agro-based industry in india is the largest producer of both sugar and sugarcane
it contributes about % of the total sugar production in the world
the first sugar mill was established in  in bihar and then many mills were established in many parts of bihar and uttar pradesh
this industry provides employment to more than  lakh persons and large number of farmers
it is a seasonal industry
location of the sugar industry as sugarcane is a heavy low value weight losing and perishable raw material thus sugar factories are located mostly in sugarcane growing regions
maharashtra has emerged as a leading sugar producer in the country and produces more than one- third of the total production of the sugar in the country
uttar pradesh is now the second largest producer of sugar
 tarai region lakhimpur kheri basti gonda gorakhpur bahraich distiricts
sugar producing states tamil nadu has sugar factories in coimbatore vellore tiruvanamalai villupuram and tiruchchirappalli districts
in karnataka the important sugar producers are belgaum bellary mandya shimoga bijapur and chitradurg
the industry is distributed in the coastal regions i
east godavari west godavari vishakhapatnam districts and nizamabad and medak districts of telangana alongwith chittoor district or rayalseema
other sugar producing states are  bihar saran champaran muzaffarpur si wan dharbanga gaya
 punjab gurdaspur jalandhar sangarur patiala amritsar
 haryana yamuna nagar rohtak hissar faridabad
 gujarat sugar industry is comparatively new here
important sugar producing mills are located in surat junagarh rajkot amreli valsad and bhavnagar districts
petrochemical industries this group of industries has been growing very fast in india
the demand of its products is very high since s
many items are derived from crude petroleum which provide raw materials for many new industries these are collectively known as petrochemical industries
petrochemical industries are divided into four sub-groups 
surfactant intermediate distribution of petrochemical industries mumbai is the hub of the petrochemical industries
other cracker units are at auraiya uttar pradesh jamnagar gandhinagar and hajira gujarat nogothane ratnagiri maharashtra haldia west bengal and vishakhapatnam andhra pradesh
 petrofies cooperative limited pcl it is a joint venture of the government of india and weaver’s cooperative societies
it has two plants at vadodara and maldhari where polyester filament yam and nylon chips are produced
 central institutes of plastic engineering and technology cipet it is involved in imparting training in petrochemical industry
sub-groups of petrochemical industries polymers are made from ethylene and propylene which are obtained after refining crude oil
it provides the basic raw material for plastic industry which are preferred because of their strength flexibility water and chemical resistance and low prices
the major producers of plastic materials are mumbai barauni mettur pimpri and rishra
about % of these units are in small scale sector
the industry also uses recycled plastics which constitutes about % of the total production
synthetic fibres are widely used in the manufacturing of fabrics because of their durability washability and resistance to shrinkage
the important fibres and their producing centres are nylon and polyester industries at kota pimpri mimbai modinagar pune ujjain nagpur and udhna and acrylic staple fibre industries at kota and vadodara
now plastic has emerged as greatest threat to our environment because of its non-biodegradable quality
knowledge based industries  the it and it enabled business process outsourcing ites-bpo services continue to grow with an outstanding rate
 a number of software park have been created by the government and the production of the software industries has surpassed electronic hardware production
 the contribution of the it software and services industry in india’s gdp is about %
 most of the multinational companies in it field has re-established software or research development centres in india
 in hardware development sector india has yet not achieved so much but in it sector it creates double employment rate every year
to build on the gains already made
correct the distortions or weaknesses that have crept in
maintain a sustained growth in productivity and gainful employment
following were the policy measures taken under lpg 
free entry to foreign technology
abolition of phased manufacturing programme
the policy has three main dimensions liberalisation privatisation and globalisation
except six industries based on security strategic or environmental concerns for all industries the licensing system has been abolished
the number of industries reserved for public sector since  have been reduced from  to 
department of atomic energy as well as railways have remained under the public sector
for investment in delicensed sector no prior approval is required
foreign direct investment fdi became supplement to domestic investment in achieving a higher level of economic development in this policy
the industrial policy has been liberalised to attract private investor both domestic and multi-nationals
globalisation refers to the integration of the country’s economy with the world economy
there is free flow of goods and services labours capitals from one nation to another
globalisation aimed at increasing domestic and external competition through market mechanism and facilitating dynamic relationship with the foreign investors and suppliers of technology
in indian context globalisation has following objectives  opening of the economy to foreign direct investment by providing facilities to foreign companies to invest in different fields of economic activities in india
 removing restrictions and obstacles to the entry of multi-national companies in india
 carrying out massive import liberalisation programmes by switching over from quantitative restrictions to tariffs in the first place and then bringing down the level of import duties considerably
 instead of a set of export incentives opting for exchange rate adjustments for promoting export
adverse effect of lpg  infra structural sector was remained untouched while major share went to core sectors
 the gap between developed and developing states has became wider and inter-regional disparity has been increased e
out of total investment from - one fourth % was for maharashtra % for gujarat % for andhra pradesh about % for tamil nadu and only  % for uttar pradesh
thus the share of both domestic and foreign investment went to already developed states
share of both domestic and foreign investment went to already developed states
 economically weaker states could not compete with developed states in open market in attracting industrial investment

primitive societies subsisted on ‘natural means of subsistence’ i
importance of geography geography helps us to understand the diversity and the causes and factors that have created it
through geography we understand how spherical earth is presented through a map and we get information about soil minerals weather climate population means of transport and communication local landscape etc
it also tells us about rivers mountains plateaus plains deserts seas lakes and cultural facts
the term geography was first coined by eratosthenese a greek scholar -  bc
the word has been derived from two roots from greek language geo earth and graphos description
put together they mean description of the earth
the earth has always been seen as the abode of human beings and thus scholars defined geography as “the description of the earth as the abode of human beings”
geographers do not study only the variations in the phenomena over the earth’s surface space but also study the associations with the other factors which cause these variations
for example cropping patterns differ from region to region but this variation in cropping pattern as a phenomenon is related to variations in soils climates demands in the market capacity of the farmer to invest and technological inputs available to herhim
geography as a discipline is concerned with three sets of questions  some questions are concerned with the identification of the patterns of natural and cultural features as found over the surface of the earth
these are the questions about “what”  second type of questions are related to the distribution of the natural and human cultural features over the surface of the earth
these are the questions about where  the third question is related to the explanation or the causal relationships between features and the processes and phenomena
study different aspects of the earth’s surface
a geographer is required to have a broad understanding of all the related fields to be able to logically integrate them
a geographer should have some proficiency in mathematics and art particularly in drawing maps
geography is very much linked with the study of astronomical locations and deals with latitudes and longitudes
the cartographic and quantitative techniques require sufficient proficiency in mathematics statistics and econometrics
all the social science disciplines viz
sociology political science economics and demography study different aspects of social reality
the branches of geography viz
social political economic and population and settlements are closely linked with these disciplines as each one of them has spatial attributes
the systematic geography was introduced by alexander von humboldt a german geographer - while regional geography approach was developed by another german geographer and a contemporary of humboldt karl ritter -
important terms  geography geography is concerned with the description and explanation of the areal differentiation of the earth’s surface
richard hartshome in other words geography studies the differences of phenomena usually related in different parts of the earth’s surface
hettner geography-xi  geo-morphology it is concerned with the study of land forms their evolution and related processes
 climatology it is concerned with the study of structure of atmosphere and elements of weather and climates and climatic types and regions
 hydrology it studies the realm of water over the surface of the earth including oceans lakes rivers and other water bodies and its effect on different life forms including human life and their activities
 soil geography it is concerned with the study the processes of soil formation soil types their fertility status distribution and use
 socialcultural geography it is concerned with the study of society and its spatial dynamics as well as the cultural elements contributed by the society
 settlement geography it studies the characteristics of rural and urban settlements
 economic geography it studies economic activities of the people including agriculture industry tourism trade and transport infrastructure and services etc
in other words it studies how history has influenced the geography of a region
 political geography it studies the impact of political events and studies boundaries space relations between neighboring political units delimitation of constituencies election scenario and develops theoretical framework to understand the political behavior of the population
 bio-geography it has emerged as a result of the interface between physical geography and human geography
it has three branches plant geography zoo geography and ecology
 plant geography it studies the spatial pattern of natural vegetation in their habitats
 zoo geography it studies the spatial patterns and geographic characteristics of animals and their habitats
 ecology it is concerned with the scientific study of the habitats characteristic of species
 environmental geography it is concerned with environmental problems such as land gradation pollution and environment conservation
one of the earlier and popular arguments was by german philosopher immanuel kant which was revised by mathematician laplace in 
according to this hypothesis the planets were formed out of a cloud of material associated with a youthful sun which was slowly rotating
in  chamberlain and moulton considered that a wandering star approached the sun
as a result a cigar-shaped extension of material was separated from the solar surface
as the passing star moved away the material separated from the solar surface continued to revolve around the sun and it slowly condensed into planets
later on the arguments considered of a companion to the sun to have been coexisting
these arguments are called binary theories
the most popular argument regarding the origin of the universe is the big bang theory
it is also called expanding universe hypothesis
the big bang theory considers the following stages in the development of the universe
 in the beginning all matter forming the universe existed in one place in the form of a“tiny ball” singular atom with an unimaginably small volume infinite temperature and infinite density
 at the big bang the “tiny ball” exploded violently
this led to a huge expansion
it is now generally accepted that the event of big bang took place 
 billion years before the present
 within  years from the big bang temperature dropped to  k kelvin and gave rise to atomic matter
a galaxy contains a large number of stars
galaxies spread over vast distances that are measured in thousands of light-years
the diameters of individual galaxies range from - light years
akash ganga or the milky way our galaxy started to form by accumulation of hydrogen gas in the form of a very large cloud called nebula
eventually growing nebula develops localised clumps of gas
these clumps continue to grow into even denser gaseous bodies giving rise to formation of stars
the formation of stars is believed to have taken place some - billion years ago
our solar system consists of eight planets
the nebula from which our solar system is supposed to have been formed started its collapse and core formation some time -
 billion years ago and the planets were formed about 
the solar system the moon is the only natural satellite of the’ earth
it is now generally believed that the formation of moon as a satellite of the earth is an outcome of ‘giant impact’ or what is described as “the big splat”
a bbdy of the size of one to three times that of mars collided into the earth sometime shortly after the earth was formed
it blasted a large part of the earth into space
this portion of blasted material then continued to orbit the earth and eventually formed into the present moon about 
there are three stages in the evolution of the present atmosphere
the first stage is marked by the loss of primordial atmosphere
in the second stage the hot interior of the earth contributed to the evolutipn of the atmosphere
finally the composition of the atmosphere was modified by the living world through the process of photosynthesis
sometime around  million years ago life began to evolve
however around - million years before the present the process of photosynthesis got evolved
life was f confined to the oceans for a long time
the microscopic structures closely related to the present form of blue algae have been found in geologicad formations much older than some  million years
it can be assumed that life began to evolve sometime  million years ago
important terms  light year a light year is equal to the number of kilometers traveled by light per second
it is a measure of distance and not of time
light travels at a speed of  kmsecond
therefore the distances the light will travel in one year is taken to be as one light year
 planetesimals the gas cloud starts getting condensed and the matter around the core develops into small- rounded objects

 the earth’s radius is  km
 earthquakes volcanic eruptions and magma are major sources of the information on interior of the earth
the indirect sources include analysis of the information meteors reaching the earth gravitation magnetic field and seismic activity
 we get to know through mining activity that temperature and pressure increase with the increasing distance from the surface towards the interior in deeper depths
moreover it is also known that the density of the material also increases with depth
it is possible to find the rate of change of these characteristics
 an instrument called ‘seismograph’ records the waves reaching the surface
 the velocity of waves changes as they travel through materials with different densities
the denser the material the higher is the velocity
 seismographic waves are of two types p waves and s waves
 the seismographs located beyond ° from epicenter record the arrival of p-waves but not that of s-waves
 a zone between ° and ° from epicenter was identified as the shadow zone for both the types of waves
 the entire zone beyond ° does not receive s-waves
the shadow zone of s-wave is much larger than that of the p-waves
the shadow zone of p-waves appears as a band around the earth between ° and ° away from the epicenter
 earthquakes are of two types a tectonic earthquake and b volcanic earthquake
 the magnitude of earthquake is measured through richter scale
it relates to the energy released during the quake
the magnitude is expressed in absolute numbers -
the intensity scale is named after mercalli an italian seismologist
 the crust is the outermost solid part of the earth
it is brittle in nature
the thickness of the crust varies under the oceanic and continental areas
oceanic crust is thinner as compared to the continental crust
 the mean thickness of oceanic crust is  km whereas that of the continental is around  km
the continental crust is thicker in the areas of major mountain systems
it is as much as  km thick in the himalayan region
 the portion of the interior beyond the crust is called the mantle
the mantle extends from moho’s discontinuity to a depth of  km
 the core is the innermost portion of the earth
the core- mantle boundary is located at the depth of  km
the depth of the core is from  km to  km
 barring the basalt flows the shield volcanoes are the largest of all the volcanoes on the earth
the hawaiian volcanoes are the most famous examples
important terms  earthquake an earthquake in simple words is shaking of the earth
it is a natural event
it is caused due to release of energy which generates waves that travel in all directions
 lithosphere the lithosphere refers to the portion of depth up to  km from the surface of the earth  volcano a volcano is a place where gases ashes andor molten rock material – lava – escape to the ground
 active volcano a volcano is called an active volcano if the materials mentioned are being released or have been released out in the recent past
 magma as long as liquid rocks arena the upper portion of the mantle it is called magma
 lava when magma reaches the irust of the earth it is called lava
 intrusive forms the lava that cools within the crustal portions assumes different forms
these forms are called intrusive forms
’batholiths are the cooled portion of magma chambers
 caldera these are the most explosive of the earth’s volcanoes
they are usually so explosive that when they erupt they fend to collapse on themselves rather than building any tall structure
the collapsed depressions are called calderas
 lacoliths these are large dome-shaped intrusive bodies with a level base and connected by a pipe-like conduit from below
it resembles the surface volcanic domes of composite volcano only these are located at deeper depths
 lapolith as and when the lava moves upwards a portion of the same may tend to move in a horizontal direction wherever it finds a weak plane
it may get rested in different forms
‘ in case it develops into a saucer shape concave to the sky body it is called lapolith
 phacolith a wavy mass of intrusive rocks at times is found at the base of synclines or at the top of anticline in folded igneous country
such wavy materials have a definite conduit to source beneath in the form of magma chambers subsequently developed as batholiths
these are called the phacoliths
 sills the near horizontal bodies gf the intrusive igneous rocks are called sill or sheet depending on the thickness of the material
the thinner ones are called sheets while the thick horizontal deposits are called sills
 hypocentre the point where the energy is released is called the focus of an earthquake alternatively it is called the hypocentre
 epicentre the point on the surface which is nearest to the focus of energy is called epicenterit is the first one to experience the waves
it is a point directly above the focus
 crust the crust is the outermost solid part of the earth
 mantle the portion of the interior beyond the crust is called the mantle

 richter scale the earthquake events are scaled either according to the magnitude or intensity of the shock
the magnitude scale is known as the richter scale
 shield volcanoes these volcanoes are mostly made up of basalt a type of lava that is very fluid when erupted
for this reason these volcanoes are not steep
 composite volcanoes these volcanoes are characterised by eruptions of cooler and more viscous waves than basalt
these volcanoes often result in explosive eruptions
 p-waves p waves move faster and are the first to arrive at the surface
these are also called ‘primary waves’
waves s-waves arrive at the surface with some time lag
these are called secondary waves
alfred wegener—a german meteorologist put forth a comprehensive argument in the form of “the continental drift theory” in 
this was regarding the distribution of the oceans and the continents
according to wegener all the continents formed a single continental mass and mega ocean surrounded the same
the super continent was named pangaea which meant all earth
the mega-ocean was called panthalasa meaning all water
wegener argued that around  million years ago the super continent pangaea began to split
pangaea first broke into two large continental masses as laurasia and gondwanaland forming the northern and southern components respectively
subsequently laurasia and gondwanaland continued to break into various smaller continents that exist today
the ocean floor may be segmented into three major divisions based on the depth as well as the forms of relief
these divisions are continental margins deep-sea basins and mid-ocean ridges
india is supposed to have started her northward journey about  million years ago at the time when pangaea broke
india collided with asia about -  million years ago causing rapid uplift of the himalayas
the theory of plate tectonics proposes that the earth’s lithosphere is divided into seven major and some minor plates
this cycle is repeated over and over to generate what scientists call a convection cell or convective flow
 pangaea the super continent was named pangaea which meant all earth
 panthalassa the mega-ocean was called panthalassa meaning all water
 rim of fire the rim of the pacific is also called rim of fire due to the existence of active volcanoes in this area
 convergent boundaries where the crust is destroyed as one plate dived under another it is called convergent boundaries
 subduction zone the location where sinking of a plate occurs is called a subduction zone
 divergent boundaries where new crust is generated as the plates pull away from each other these are called divergent boundaries
 spreading sites the sites where the plates move away from each other are called spreading sites
 transform boundaries where the crust is neither produced nor destroyed as the plates slide horizontally past each other
 tectonic plate it is a massive irregularly-shaped slab of solid rock generally composed of both continental and oceanic lithosphere
plates move horizontally over the asthenosphere as rigid units
 tillite it is the sedimentary rock formed out of deposits of glaciers
 sea floor spreading the deep trenches have deep-seated earthquake occurrences while in the mid- oceanic ridge areas the quake foci have shallow depths
these facts and a detailed analysis of magnetic properties of the rocks on either sides of the mid-oceanic ridge led hess in  to propose his hypothesis
it was called the “sea floor spreading”
a mineral is composed of two or more elements
but sometimes single element minerals like sulphur copper silver gold graphite etc
there are many different kinds of rocks which are grouped under three families on the basis of their mode of formation
they are  igneous rocks — solidified from magma and lava  sedimentary rocks—the result of deposition of fragments of rocks by exogenous processes  metamorphic rocks — formed out of existing rocks undergoing recrystallisation
the basic source of all minerals is the hot magma in the interior of the earth
when magma cools crystals of minerals appear and a systematic series of minerals are formed in sequence to solidify so as to form rocks
granite gabbro pegmatite basalt volcanic breccia and tuff are some of the examples of
the word ‘sedimentary’ is derived from the latin word sedimentum which means settling
there are at least  minerals that have been named and identified in the earth crust but almost all the commonly occurring ones are related to six major mineral groups that are known as major rock forming minerals
important terms  petrology it is science of rocks
a petrologist studies rocks in all their aspects viz
 mineral composition texture structure origin occurrence alteration and relationship with other rocks
the igneous rocks ignis – in latin means ‘fire’ are formed when magma cools and solidifies
 sedimentary rocks the word ‘sedimentary’ is derived from the latin word sedimentum which means settling
 metamorphic rocks the word metamorphic means ‘change of form’
these rocks form under the action of pressure volume and temperature pvt changes
metamorphism occurs when rocks are forced down to lower levels by tectonic processes or when molten magma rising through the crust comes in contact with the crustal rocks or the underlying rocks are subjected to great amounts of pressure by overlying rocks
 lithification rocks igneous sedimentary and metamorphic of the earth’s surface are exposed to denudational agents and are broken up into various sizes of fragments
such fragments are transported by different exogenous agencies and deposited
these deposits through compaction turn into rocks
this process is called lithification
 rock cycle rock cycle is a continuous process through which old rocks are transformed into new ones
 lineation in the process of metamorphism in some rocks grains or minerals get arranged in layers or lines
such an arrangement of minerals or grains in metamorphic rocks is called foliation or lineation
 banding sometimes minerals or materials of different groups are arranged into alternating thin to thick layers appearing in light and dark shades
such a structure in metamorphic rocks is called banding
 banding rocks rocks displaying banding are called banded rocks
it is undergoing change continuously
some powers have led to changes in form of the earth
these powers have been divided into two parts internal and external
internal forces keep giving birth to new land forms
external forces keep changing the forms of exiting land forms
in other words the earth’s surface is being continuously subjected to by external forces originating within the earth’s atmosphere and by internal forces from within the earth
the external forces are known as exogenic forces and the internal forces are known as endogenic forces
the endogenic and exogenic forces causing physical stresses and chemical actions on earth materials and bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes
diastrophism and volcanism are endogenic geomorphic processes
weathering mass wasting erosion and deposition are exogenic geomorphic processes
all processes that move elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism
they include  orogenic processes  epeirogenic processes  earthquakes  plate tectonics
temperature and precipitation are the two important climatic elements that control various processes
water and air oxygen and carbon dioxide along with heat must be present to speed up all chemical reactions
over and above the carbon dioxide present in the air decomposition of plants and animals increases the quantity of carbon dioxide underground
oxidation occurs where there is ready access to the atmosphere and oxygenated waters
the minerals most commonly involved in this process are iron manganese sulfur etc
in the process of oxidation rock breakdown occurs due to the disturbance caused by addition of oxygen
red color of iron upon oxidation turns to brown or yellow
hydration is the chemical addition of water
minerals take up water and expand this expansion causes an increase in the volume of the material itself or rock
the process causes fatigue in the rocks and may lead to their disintegration carbonation is the reaction of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals and is a common process helping the breaking down of feldspars and carbonate minerals
carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and soil air is absorbed by water to form carbonic acid that acts as a weak acid
calcium carbonates and magnesium carbonates are dissolved in carbonic acid and are removed in a solution without leaving any residue resulting in cave formation
when oxidized minerals are placed in an environment where oxygen is absent reduction takes place
red colour of iron upon reduction turns to greenish or bluish grey
debris avalanches and landslides transfer the mass of rock debris down the slopes under the direct influence of gravity
that means air water or ice do not carry debris with them from place to place but on the other hand the debris may carry with it air water or ice
in our country debris avalanches and landslides occur very frequently in the himalayas
there are many reasons for this
one the himalayas are tectonically active
they are mostly made up of sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated and semi-consolidated deposits
the slopes are very steep
important terms  landslides these are relatively rapid and perceptible movements
the materials involved are relatively dry
the size and shape of the detached mass depends on the nature of discontinuities in the rock the degree of weathering and the steepness of the slope
 gradation the phenomenon of wearing down of relief variations of the surface of the earth through erosion is known as gradation
 geomorphic processes the endogenic and exogenic forces causing physical stresses and chemical actions on earth materials and bringing about changes in the configuration of the surface of the earth are known as geomorphic processes
 exogenic forces the external forces are known as exogenic forces
these forces derive their energy from atmosphere determined by the ultimate energy from the sun and also the gradients created by tectonic factors
 endogenic forces the internal forces are known as endogenic forces
 geomorphic agents an agent is a mobile medium like running water moving ice masses wind waves and currents etc
 which removes transports and deposits earth materials
running water groundwater glaciers wind waves and currents etc
 can be called geomorphic agents
 diastrophism all processes that move elevate or build up portions of the earth’s crust come under diastrophism
 volcanism volcanism includes the movement of molten rock called magma onto or toward the earth’s surface and also formation of many intrusive and extrusive volcanic forms
 stress gravitational force acts upon all earth materials having a sloping surface and tend to produce movement of matter in down slope direction
force applied per unit area is called stress
 weathering weathering is defined as mechanical disintegration and chemical decomposition of rocks through the actions of various elements of weather and climate
 denudation the term ‘denude’ means to strip off or to uncover
weathering mass wasting movements erosion and transportation are included in denudation
 solution when something is dissolved in water or acids the water or acid with dissolved contents is called solution
 carbonation carbonation is the reaction of carbonate and bicarbonate with minerals and is a common process helping the breaking down of feldspars and carbonate minerals
 hydration hydration is the chemical addition of water
 structure the term structure includes such aspects of rocks as folds faults orientationand inclination of beds presence or absence of joints bedding planes hardness or softness of constituent minerals chemical susceptibility of mineral constituents the permeability or impermeability etc
  enrichment when rocks undergo weathering some materials are removed through chemical or physical leaching by groundwater and thereby the concentration of valuable materials increases
it makes the concentration of the same valuable material sufficient and economically viable to be exploited processed and refined
 debris slide rapid rolling or sliding of earth debris without backward rotation of mass is known as debris slide
 soil a pedologist who studies soils defines soil as a collection of natural bodies on the earth’s surface containing living andor dead matter and supporting or capable of supporting plants
soil is a dynamic medium in which many chemical physical and biological activities go on constantly
 deposition the erosional agents loose their velocity and hence energy on gentler slopes and the materials carried by them start to settle themselves
therefore deposition is not actually the work of any agent
the coarser materials get deposited first and finer ones later
by deposition depressions get filled up
 slump slump is slipping of one or several units of rock debris with a backward rotation with respect to the slope over which the movement takes place
 pedology it is soil science
 pedologist a pedologist is a soil-scientist
 parent material parent material is a passive control factor in soil formation
 earth flow movement of water-saturated clayey or silty earth materials down low-angle terraces or hillsides is known as earth flow
 nitrogen fixation humus accumulates in cold climates as bacterial growth is slow
in humid tropical and equatorial climates bacterial growth and action is intense and dead vegetation is rapidly oxidised leaving very low humus content in the soil
this process is known as nitrogen fixation
 desilication removal of silica from the soil is known as desilication
 exfoliation it is a result but not a process
flaking off of more or less curved sheets of shells from over rocks or bedrock results in smooth and rounded surfaces is called exfoliation
 tors in rocks like granites smooth surfaced and rounded small to big boulders form due to such exfoliation
due to changes in climatic conditions and vertical or horizontal movements of landmasses either the intensity of processes or the processes themselves might change leading to new modifications in the land forms
a landmass passes through stages of development somewhat comparable to the stages of life — youth mature and old age
changes on the surface of the earth owe mostly to erosion by various geomorphic agents
of course the process of deposition too by covering the land surfaces and filling the basins valleys or depressions brings changes in the surface of the land
the geomorphic agents acting over long periods of time produce systematic changes leading to sequential development of land forms
each geomorphic agent produces its own assemblage of land forms
many varieties of land forms develop by the action of each of the geomorphic agents depending upon especially the type and structure i
folds faults joints fractures hardness and softness permeability and impermeability etc
in humid regions which receive heavy rainfall running water is considered the most important of the geomorphic agents in bringing about the degradation of the land surface
the gentler the river channels in gradient or slope the greater is the deposition
streams divides are broad and flat with marshes swamp and lakes
during mature stage streams are plenty with good integration
the flat and broad inter stream areas and swamps and marshes of youth disappear and the stream divides turn sharp
smaller tributaries during old age meander freely over vast floodplains showing natural levees oxbow lakes etc
any limestone or dolomitic region showing typical land forms produced by the action of groundwater through the processes of solution and deposition is called karst topography after the typical topography developed in limestone rocks of karst region in the balkans adjacent to adriatic sea
drumlins are smooth oval shaped ridge-like features composed mainly of glacial till with some masses of gravel and sand
the long axes of drumlins are parallel to the direction of ice movement
they may measure up to  km in length and  m or so in height
a glacier in its valley is slow unlike water flow
the movement could be a few centimeters to a few meters a day or even less or more
glaciers move basically because of the force of gravity
we have many glaciers in our country moving down the slopes and valleys in himalayas
higher reaches of uttaranchal himachal pradesh and jammu and kashmir are places to see some of them
the highest peak in the alps matterhorn and the highest peak in the himalayas everest are in fact horns formed through headward erosion of radiating cirques
erosional forms dominate in the west coast
the east coast of india is a low sedimentary coast
depositional forms dominate in the east coast

 spit barrier bar which get keyed up to the headland of a bay is called a spit
 sea stacks retreat of the cliff may leave some remnants of rock standing isolated as small islands just off the shore
such resistant masses of rock originally parts of a cliff or hill are called sea stacks
 wave-cut terrace at the foot of such cliffs there may be a flat or gently sloping platform covered by rock debris derived from the sea cliff behind
such platforms occurring at elevations above the average height of waves is called a wave-cut terrace
 off-shore bar a ridge of sand and shingle formed in the sea in the off- shore zone from the position of low tide waterline to seaward lying approximately parallel to the coast is called an off-shore bar
 parallel retreat of slopes through backwasting  once pediments are formed with a steep wash slope followed by cliff or free face above it the steep wash slope and free faceretreat backwards
this method of erosion is termed as parallel retreat of slopes through backwasting
 pediments gently inclined rocky floors close to the mountains at their foot with or without a thin cover of debris are called pediments
 pediplains through parallel retreat of slopes the pediments extend backwards at the expense of mountain front and gradually the mountain gets reduced leaving an inselberg which is a remnant of the mountain
these low featureless plains are called pediplains
 playas plains these are by far the most prominent land forms in the deserts
in times of sufficient water this plain is covered up by a shallow water body
such types of shallow lakes are called as playas where water is retained only for short duration due to evaporation and quite often the playas contain good deposition of salts
 alkali flats the playa plain covered up by salts is called alkali flats
 deflation hollows deflation hollows and caves weathered mantle from over the rocks or bare soil gets blown out by persistent movement of wind currents in one direction
this process may create shallow depressions called deflation hollows
 caves deflation also creates numerous small pits or cavities over rock surfaces

 tunnels caves having openings at both the ends are called tunnels
 glaciers masses of ice moving as sheets over the land or as linear flows down the slopes of mountains in broad trough-like valleys mountain and valley glaciers are called glaciers
 fiords very deep glacial troughs filled with sea water and making up shorelines in high latitudes are called fiords
 tam lakes a lake of water can be seen quite often within the cirques after the glacier disappears

the air is colorless and odorless and can be felt only when it blows as wind
the atmosphere is composed of gases water vapour and dust particles
the proportion of gases changes in the higher layers of the atmosphere in such a way that oxygen will be almost in negligible quantity at the height of  km
similarly carbon dioxide and water vapour are found only up to  km from the surface of the earth
it absorbs a part of terrestrial radiation and reflects back some part of it towards the earth’s surface
it is largely responsible for the green house effect
due to burning of fossil fuels the volume of other gases is constant but the volume of carbon dioxide has been rising in the past few decades
it has also increased the temperature of the air
ozone is another important component of the atmosphere
it is found between  and  km above the earth’s surface and acts as a filter
it absorbs the ultra-violet rays radiating from the sun
it prevents them from reaching the surface of the earth
water vapour is such a variable gas in the atmosphere which decreases with altitude
in the warm and wet tropics it may account for four per cent of the air by volume while in the dry and cold areas of desert and polar regions it may be less than one per cent of the air
water vapour also decreases from the equator towards the poles
it absorbs parts of the isolation from the sun and preserves the earth’s radiated heat
it thus acts like a blanket allowing the earth neither to become too cold nor too hot
water vapour also contributes to the stability and instability in the air
atmosphere has a sufficient capacity to keep small solid particles which may originate from different sources and include sea salts fine soil smoke-soot ash pollen dust and disintegrated particles of meteors
dust particles are generally concentrated in the lower layers of the atmosphere yet convectional air currents may transport them to great heights
the higher concentration of dust particles is found in subtropical and temperate regions due to dry winds in comparison to equatorial and polar regions
dust and salt particles act as hygroscopic nuclei around which water vapour condenses to produce clouds
the atmosphere consists of different layers with varying density and temperature
density is highest near the surface of the earth and decreases with increasing altitude
they are troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere and exosphere
the troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere
its average height is  km and extends roughly to a height of  km near the poles and about  km at the equator
thickness of the troposphere is greatest at the equator because heat is transported to great heights by strong convectional currents
this layer contains dust particles and water vapour
all changes in climate and weather take place in this layer
the temperature in this layer decreases at the rate of °c for every m of height
the zone separating the troposphere from stratosphere is known as the tropopause
the air temperature at the tropopause is about minus °c over the equator and about minus °c over the poles
the stratosphere is found above the tropopause and extends up to a height of  km
one important feature of the stratosphere is that it contains the ozone layer
this layer absorbs ultra-violet radiation and shields life on the earth from intense harmful form of energy
the mesosphere lies above the stratosphere which extends up to a height of  km
in this layer temperature starts decreasing with the increase in altitude and reaches up to minus °c at the height of  km
the upper limit of mesosphere is known as the mesopause
the ionosphere is located between  and  km above the mesopause
it contains electrically charged particles known as ions and hence it is known as ionosphere
radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer
temperature here starts increasing with height
the uppermost layer of the atmosphere above the thermosphere is known as the exosphere
this is the highest layer but very little is known about it
important terms  ions electrically charged particles are called ions
 atmosphere atmosphere is a mixture of different gases and it envelopes the earth all round
it contains life-giving gases like oxygen for humans and animals and carbon dioxide for plants
 tropopause the zone separating the troposphere from stratosphere is known as the tropopause
 troposphere the troposphere is the lowermost layer of the atmosphere

 stratosphere the stratosphere is found above the tropopause and extends up to a height of  km
this layer absorbs ultra-violet radiation and shields life on the earth from intense harmful form of energy
 mesosphere the mesosphere lies above the stratosphere which extends up to a height of  km
in this layer temperature starts decreasing with the increase in altitude and reaches up to minus °c at the height of  km
 ionosphere the ionosphere is located between  and  km above the mesopause
it contains electrically charged particles known as ions and hence it is known as ionosphere
 exosphere the uppermost layer of the atmosphere above the thermosphere is known as the exosphere
this is the highest layer but very little is known about it
we inhale and exhale but we feel the air when it is in motion
it means air in motion is wind
envelop of air is atmosphere which is formed of multitude gases
these gases support life over the earth’s surface
the earth’s surface receives most of its energy in short wavelengths
the annual insolation received by the earth on rd january is slightly more than the amount received on th july
however the effect of this variation in the solar output is masked by other factors like the distribution of land sea and the atmospheric circulation
hence this variation in the solar output does not have great effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth
therefore we see that the earth neither remains cold nor hot for too long
and hence temperature at different places of the earth is different
this difference in temperature causes difference in pressure
as the earth is a geoid resembling a sphere the sun’s rays fall obliquely at the top of the atmosphere and the earth intercepts a very small portion of the sun’s energy
on an average the earth receives 
cm per minute at the top of its atmosphere
the solar output received at the top of the atmosphere varies slightly in a year due to the variations in the distance between the earth and the sun
during its revolution around the sun the earth is farthest from the sun  million km on th july ‘t his position of the earth is called aphelion
on rd january the earth is the nearest to the sun  million km
this position is called perihelion
the annual insolation received by the earth on rd january is slightly more than the amount received on th july
the amount of solar radiation keeps changing daily on the basis of weather and per year
output is masked by other factors like the distribution of land and sea and the atmospheric circulation
hence this variation in the solar output does not have great effect on daily weather changes on the surface of the earth
the earth’s axis makes an angle of  with the plane of its orbit round the sun has a greater influence on the amount of insolation received at different latitudes
the insolation received at the surface varies from about  wattm in the tropics to about  wattm in the poles
maximum insolation is received over the subtropical deserts where the cloudiness is the least
equator receives comparatively less insolation than the tropics
generally at the same latitude the insolation is more over the continent than over the oceans
in winter the middle and higher latitudes receive less radiation than in summer
the earth after being heated by insolation transmits the heat to the atmospheric layers near to the earth in long wave form
this process is called conduction
the air in cpntact with the earth rises vertically on heating in the form of currents and further transmits the heat of the atmosphere
this process of vertical heating of the atmosphere is known as convection
out of  units of heat received roughly  units are reflected back to space even before reaching the earth’s surface
of these  units are reflected back from the top of the clouds and  units from the snow and ice-covered areas of the earth
the remaining  units are absorbed  units within the atmosphere and  units by the earth’s surface
normally temperature decreases with increase in elevation
it is called normal lapse rate
at times the situations is reversed and the normal lapse rate is inverted
it is called inversion of temperature
inversion is usually of short duration but quite common nonetheless
a long winter night with clear skies and still air is ideal situation for inversion
the heat of the day is radiated off during the night and by early morning hours the earth is cooler than the air above
over polar areas temperature inversion is normal throughout the year
surface inversion promotes stability in the lower layers of the atmosphere
smoke and dust particles get collected beneath the inversion layer and spread horizontally to fill the lower strat a of the atmosphere
dense fogs in mornings are common occurrences especially during winter season
this inversion commonly lasts for few hours until the sun comes up and beings to warm the earth
the inversion takes place in hills and mountains due to air drainage
blowing of cold air at the hills and mountains during night flows under the influence of gravity
being heavy and dense the cold air acts almost like water and moves down the slope to pile up deeply in pockets and valley bottoms with warm air above
important terms  insolation the energy received by the earth is known as incoming solar radiation which in short is termed as insolation
 aphelion during its revolution around the sun the earth is farthest from the sun  million km on th july
this position of the earth is called aphelion
this position is called perihelion
 terrestrial radiation the insolation received by the earth is in short waves forms and heats up its surface
the earth after being heated itself becomes a radiating body and it radiates energy to the atmosphere in long wave form
this energy heats up the atmosphere from below
this process is known as terrestrial radiation
 conduction the earth after being heated by insolation transmits the heat to the atmospheric layers near to the earth in long wave form
the air in contact with the land gets heated slowly and the upper layers in contact with the lower layers also get heated
this process is called conduction
 convection the air in contact with the earth rises vertically on heating in the form of currents and further transmits the heat of the atmosphere
this process of vertical heating of the atmosphere is known as convection
 advection the convective transfer of energy is confined only to the troposphere
the transfer of heat through horizontal movement of air is called advection
 albedo while passing through the atmosphere some amount of energy is reflected scattered and absorbed
only the remaining part reaches the earth surface
the reflected amount of radiation is called the albedo of the earth
 normal lapse rate normally temperature decreases with increase in elevation
it is called normal lapse rate
 loo summer season local winds is called ‘loo’
it is the result of advection

it is called inversion of temperature
this is called air drainage
it protects plants from frost damages
 plank’s law plank’s law states that hotter a body the more energy it will radiate and shorter the wavelength of that radiation
 specific heat specific heat is the energy needed to raise the temperature of one gram of substance by one celsius
this results in variations in the atmospheric pressure
the result is that it causes the movement of air from high pressure to low pressure setting the air in motion
air in horizontal motion is wind
atmospheric pressure also determines when the air will rise or sink
the wind redistributes the heat and moisture across the planet thereby maintaining a constant temperature for the planet as a whole
the vertical rising of moist air cools it down to form the clouds and bring precipitation
as one moves up the air gets varified and one feels breathless
the atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of millibar or pascal
widely used unit is called kilopascal which is expressed as hpa
at sea level the average atmospheric pressure is 
due to gravity the air at the surface is denser and hence has higher pressure
air pressure is measured with the help of a mercury barometer or the aneroid barometer
the pressure decreases with height
at any elevation it varies from place to place and its variation is the primary cause of air motion i
wind which moves from high pressure areas to low pressure
in the lower atmosphere the pressure decreases rapidly with height
the decrease amounts to about  mb for each  m increase in elevation
it does not always decrease at the same rate
the air in motion is called wind
the wind blows from high pressure to low pressure
frictional force is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends upto an elevation of  –  km
over the sea surface the friction is minimal
the rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind
this force is called the coriolis force after the french physicist who described it in 
it deflects the wind to the right direction in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere
the deflection is more when the wind velocity is high
the coriolis force is directly proportional to the angle of latitude
it is maximum at the poles and is absent at the equator
the coriolis force acts perpendicular to the pressure gradient force
the pressure gradient force is perpendicular to an isobar
the higher the pressure gradient force the more is the velocity of the wind and the larger is the deflection in the direction of wind
the velocity and direction of the wind are the net result of the wind generating forces
the winds in the upper atmosphere  –  km above the surface are free from frictional effect of the surface and are controlled mainly by the pressure gradient and the coriolis force
during the day the land heats up faster and becomes warmer than the sea
therefore over the land the air rises giving rise to a low pressure area whereas the sea is relatively cool and the pressure over sea is relatively high
thus pressure gradient from sea to land is created and the wind blows from the sea to the land as the sea breeze
in the night the reversal of condition takes place
the land loses heat faster and is cooler than the sea
the pressure gradient is from the land to the sea and hence land breeze results
in mountainous regions during the day the slopes get heated up and air moves upslope and to fill the resulting gap the air from the valley blows up the valley
during the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind
the cool air of the high plateaus and ice fields draining into the valley
the atmospheric pressure is expressed in units of millibar
 wind the air in motion is called wind
 pressure gradient force the differences in atmospheric pressure produces a force
the rate of change of pressure with respect to distance is the pressure gradient
 frictional force it affects the speed of the wind
it is greatest at the surface and its influence generally extends upto an elevation of  –  km
over the sea surface the friction is minimal
 coriolis force the rotation of the earth about its axis affects the direction of the wind
this force is called the coriolis force after the french physicist who described it in 
 geostrophic wind when isobars are straight and when there is no friction the pressure gradient force is balanced by the coriolis force and the resultant wind blows parallel to the isobar
this wind is known as the geostrophic wind
 general circulation of the atmosphere the pattern of the movement of the planetary winds is called the general circulation of the atmosphere
 cell the easterlies from either side of the equator converge in the inter tropical convergence zone itcz
such circulations from the surface upwards and vice-versa are called cells
 hadley cells a cell in the tropics is called hadley cell
 ferrel cells in the middle latitudes the circulation is that of sinking cold air that comes from the poles and the rising warm air that blows from the subtropical high
at the surface these winds are called westerlies and the cell is known as the ferrel cell
 polar cell at polar latitudes the cold dense air subsides near the poles and blows towards middle latitudes as the polar easterlies
this cell is called the polar cell
this wind is known as the valley breeze
 polar high near the poles the pressure is high and it is known as the polar high
 el nino the warm water of the central pacific ocean slowly drifts towards south american coast and replaces the cool peruvian current
such appearance of warm water off the coast of peru is known as the el nino
 southern oscillation the change in pressure condition over pacific is known as the southern oscillation
 enso the combined phenomenon of southern oscillation and el nino is known as enso
 katabatic wind during the night the slopes get cooled and the dense air descends into the valley as the mountain wind

 landfall of the cyclone the place where a tropical cyclone crosses the coast is called the landfall of the cyclone
 a mature tropical cyclone it is characterized by the strong spirally circulating wind around the centre called the eye
the diameter of the circulating system can vary between  and  km
the eye is a region of calm with subsiding air
 tropical cyclones tropical cyclones are violent storms that originate over oceans in tropical areas and shift to the coastal areas bringing about large scale destruction caused by violent winds very heavy rainfall and storm surges
this is one of the most devastating natural calamities
 tornado from severe thunderstorms sometimes spiralling wind descends like a trunk of an elephant with great force with very low pressure at the centre causing massive destruction on its way
such a phenomenon is called a tornado
 water spouts the tornado over the sea is called water spouts
it varies from zero to four per cent by volume of the atmosphere and plays an important role in the weather phenomena
water is present in the atmosphere in three forms namely—gaseous liquid and solid
the moisture in the atmosphere is derived from water bodies through evaporation and from plants through transpiration
thus there is a continuous exchange of water between the atmosphere the oceans and the continents through the processes of evaporation transpiration condensation and precipitation
the air containing moisture to its full capacity at a given temperature is said to be saturated
it means that the air at the given temperature is incapable of holding any additional amount of moisture at that stage
the temperature at which saturation occurs in a given sample of air is known as dew point
the absolute humidity differs from place to place on the surface of the earth
the percentage of moisture present in the atmosphere as compared to its full capacity at a given temperature is known as the relative humidity
with the change of air temperature the capacity to retain moisture increases or decreases and the relative humidity is also affected
it is greater over the oceans and least over the continents
movement of air replaces the saturated layer with the unsaturated layer
hence the greater the movement of air the greater is the evaporation
the transformation of water vapour into water is called condensation
condensation is caused by the loss of heat
when moist air is cooled it may reach a level when its capacity to hold water vapour ceases
condensation also takes place when the moist air comes in contact with some colder object and it may also take place when the temperature is close to the dew point
after condensation the moisture of atmosphere or humidity gets converted into dew fog mist frost and clouds
the ideal conditions for formation of dew are clear sky calm air high relative humidity and cold and long nights
frost forms on cold surfaces when condensation takes place below freezing point °c i
the dew point is at or below the freezing point
the only difference between the mist and fog is that mist contains more moisture than the fog
in mist each nuclei contains a thicker layer of moisture
fogs are drier than mist and they are prevalent where warm currents of air come in contact with cold currents
fogs are mini clouds in which condensation takes place around nuclei provided by the dust smoke and the salt particles
cloud is a mass of minute water droplets or tiny crystals of ice formed by the condensation of the water vapour in free air at considerable elevations
cirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes -m
they are thin and detatched clouds having a feathery appearance
they are always white in colour
cumulus clouds look like cotton wool
they are generally formed at a height of- m
they exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there
they have a flat base
stratus are layered clouds covering large portions of the sky
these clouds are generally formed either due to loss of heat or the mixing of air masses with different temperatures
nimbus clouds are black or dark gray
they form at middle levels or very near to the surface of the earth
on the basis of origin rainfall may be classified into three main types — the convectional orographic or relief and the cyclonic or frontal
convectional rain takes place when the air on being heated becomes light and rises up in convection currents
as it rises it expands and loses neat and consequently condensation takes place and cumulous clouds are formed
with thunder and lightening heavy rainfall takes place but this does not last long
orographic rain occurs when the saturated air mass comes across a mountain it is forced to ascend and as it rises it expands the temperature falls and the moisture is condensed
the chief characteristic of this sort of rain is that the windward slopes receive greater rainfall
in general as we proceed from the equator towards the poles rainfall goes on decreasing steadily
the coastal areas of the world receive greater amounts of rainfall than the interior of the continents
the rainfall is more over the oceans than on the landmasses of the world
between the latitudes ° and ° n and s of the equator the rain is heavier on the eastern coasts and goes on decreasing towards the west
but between ° and ° n and s of equator the rainfall is first received on the western margins of the continents and it goes on decreasing towards the east
in some regions rainfall is distributed evenly throughout the year such as in the equatorial belt and in the western parts of cool temperate regions
distribution of clouds classification of clouds on the basis of average height sub-categories or types of clouds features or characteristics high clouds  km to  km cirrus cirrus clouds are formed at high altitudes
they are soft and silk like shaped
cirrostratus they are thin and detatched clouds having a feathery appearance
they are always white in colour

they do not have any shadow medium clouds altostratu they are blue or brown in colour
they have fibres like look
low clouds stratocumulus soft and brownish clouds in a group which have a shining
clouds with extensive vertical development cumulus cumulus clouds look like cotton wool
they are generally formed at a height of - m
they exist in patches and can be seen scattered here and there
they have a flat base
cumulonimbus they are formed on mountains and cause rainfall

as the clouds are formed at some height over the surface of the earth they take various shapes
they are empirical genetic and applied
koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate

d – cold snow forest climates the average temperature of the coldest month is minus °c or below
e – cold climates average temperature for all months is below °c
h – high land cold due to elevation
koeppen introduced the use of capital and small letters to designate climatic groups and types
it was developed in  and modified over a period of time but koeppen’s scheme is still popular and in use
koeppen recognized five major climatic groups four of them are based on temperature and one on precipitation
the climatic groups are subdivided into types designated by small letters based on seasonality of precipitation and temperature characteristics
the seasons of dryness are indicated by the small letters  f m w and s
tropical humid climates exist between tropic of cancer and tropic of capricorn
the sun being overhead throughout the year and the presence of inter tropical convergence zone itcz make the climate hot and humid
annual range of temperature is very low and annual rainfall is high
the tropical group is divided into three types namely  af – tropical wet climate  am – tropical monsoon climate  aw – tropical wet and dry climate
tropical wet climate is found near the equator
the major areas are the amazon basin in south america western equatorial africa and the islands of east indies
significant amount of rainfall occurs in every month of the year as thunder showers in the afternoon
the temperature is uniformly high and the annual range of temperature is negligible
the maximum temperature on any day is around °c while the minimum temperature is around
tropical evergreen forests with dense canopy cover and large biodiversity are found in this climate
tropical monsoon climate am is found over the indian sub-continent north eastern part of south america and northern australia
heavy rainfall occurs mostly in summer
these climates cover a very large area of the planet extending over large latitudes from ° – ° north and south of the equator
subtropical steppe bsh and subtropical desert bwh climates have common precipitation and temperature characteristics
these are located in the transition zone between humid and dry climates subtropical steppe receives slightly more rainfall than the desert adequate enough for the growth of sparse grasslands
the highest shade temperature of ° c was recorded at a aziziyah libya on  september 
the annual and diurnal ranges of temperature are also high
mediterranean climate occurs around mediterranean sea along the west coast of continents in subtropical latitudes between ° – ° latitudes
central california central chile along the coast in south eastern and south western australia are examples of mediterranean climate
these areas come under the influence of subtropical high in summer and westerly wind in winter
hence the climate is characterised by hot dry summer and mild rainy winter
monthly average temperature in summer is around ° c and in winter below °c
the annual precipitation ranges between  –  cm
humid subtropical climate occur in eastern united states of america southern and eastern china southern japan north eastern argentina coastal south africa and eastern coast of australia
the annual average of precipitation vary from - cm
thunderstorms in summer and frontal precipitation in winter are common
mean monthly temperature in summer is around °c and in winter it varies from °-° c
the daily range of temperature is small
india also witnessed alternate wet and dry periods
archaeological findings show that the rajasthan desert experienced wet and cool climate around  b
from about -  b
 this region was the centre of the harappan civilisation
dry conditions accentuated since then
in the geological past the earth was warm some - million years ago through the cambrian ordovician and silurian periods
during the pleistocene epoch glacial and inter-glacial periods occurred the last major peak glacial period was about  years ago
the present inter-glacial period started  years ago
the s recorded the warmest temperature of the century and some of the worst floods around the world
the worst devastating drought in the sahel region south of the sahara desert from - is one such variability
during the s severe drought occurred in south-western great plains of the united states described as the dust bowl
historical records of crop yield or crop failures of floods and migration of people tell about the effects of changing climate
from about -  world temperature showed an upward trend
after  the rate of increase in temperature slowed down
the term greenhouse is derived from the analogy to a greenhouse used in cold areas for preserving heat
a greenhouse is made up of glass
the glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation
the glass therefore allows in more radiation and prevents the long wave radiation going outside the glass house causing the temperature inside the glasshouse structure warmer than outside
when you enter a car or a bus during summers where windows are closed you feel more heat than outside
likewise during winter the vehicles with closed doors and windows remain warmer than the temperature outside
this is another example of the greenhouse effect
greenhouse gases are carbon dioxide c chlorofluorocarbons cfcs methane ch nitrous oxide n and ozone 
some other gases such as nitric oxide no and carbon monoxide co easily react with ghgs and affect their concentration in the atmosphere
the largest concentration of ghgs in the atmosphere is carbon dioxide
the emission of c comes mainly from fossil fuel combustion oil gas and coal
ozone occurs in the stratosphere where ultra-violet rays convert oxygen into ozone
thus ultra violet rays do not reach the earth’s surface
the cfcs which drift into the stratosphere destroy the ozone
large depletion of ozone occurs over antarctica
the depletion of ozone concentration in the stratosphere is called the ozone hole
international efforts have been initiated for reducing the emission of ghgs into the atmosphere
the most important one is the kyoto protocol proclaimed in 
important terms  empirical classification it is based on observed data particularly on temperature and precipitation
 applied classification it is used when classification is done for specific purpose
koeppen identified a close relationship between the distribution of vegetation and climate
he selected certain values of temperature and precipitation and related them to the distribution of vegetation and used these values for classifying the climates
 ozone hole the depletion of ozone concentration in the stratosphere is called the ozone hole
 greenhouse gases the gases that absorb long wave radiation are called greenhouse gases
 greenhouse effect the processes that warm the atmosphere are often collectively referred to as the greenhouse effect
 daily range of temperature the differences between the highest and lowest temperature of a place in a day is called daily range of temperature
 dust bowl during the ’s severe drought occurred in southwestern great plains of the united states
these are described as the dust bowl
 greenhouse the term greenhouse is derived from the analogy to a greenhouse used in cold areas for preserving heat
a greenhouse is made up of glass
the glass which is transparent to incoming short wave solar radiation is opaque to outgoing long wave radiation
 sunspots sunspots are dark and cooler patches on the sun which increase and decrease in a cyclical manner
water is an essential component of all life forms that exist over the surface of the earth
water is a cyclical resource
it can be used and reused in the form of a cycle
water keeps on moving from the ocean to land and land to ocean
the water cycle has been working for billions of years and all the life on earth depends on it
the distribution of water on earth is quite uneven
many locations have plenty of water while others have very limited quantity
table  water on the earth’s surface reservoir volume million of the total cubic km percentage of the total oceans  
 ice caps and glaciers  
 streams and rivers 
 the hydro logical cycle is the circulation of water within the earth’s hydrosphere in different forms i
e the liquid solid and the gaseous phases
about  per cent of the planetary water is found in the oceans
the remaining is held as freshwater in glaciers and ice caps groundwater sources lakes soil moisture atmosphere streams and within life
nearly  per cent of the water that falls on land returns to the atmosphere through evaporation from over the oceans as well as from other places
the remainder runs-off on the surface infiltrates into the ground or a part of it becomes glacier
the geographers have divided the oceanic part of the earth into five oceans namely the pacific the atlantic the indian southern ocean and the arctic
the floors of the oceans are rugged with the world’s largest mountain ranges deepest trenches and the largest plains
the ocean floors can be divided into four major divisions  the continental shelf  the continental slope  the deep sea plain  the oceanic deeps
besides these divisions there are also major and minor relief features in the ocean floors like ridges hills sea mounts guyots trenches canyons etc
table  components and processes of the water cycle components processes water storage in oceans evaporation  evapotranspiration sublimation water in the atmosphere condensation precipitation water storage in ice and snow snow melt runoff to streams surface runoff stream flow freshwater storage and infiltration groundwater storage groundwater discharge springs the continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs
it is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of ° or even less
the siberian shelf in the arctic ocean the largest in the world stretches to  km in width
the depth of the shelves also varies
it may be as shallow as  m in some areas while in some areas it is as deep as  m
the continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins
it begins where the bottom of the continental shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope
the gradient of the slope region varies between -°
the depth of the slope region varies between  and  m
deep sea plains are gently sloping areas of the ocean basins
these are the flattest and smoothest regions of the world
these plains are covered with fine-grained sediments like clay and silt
oceanic deeps or trenches are the deepest parts of the oceans
the trenches are relatively • steep sided narrow basins
they are some - km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor
a mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression
the mountain ranges can have peaks as high as  m and some even reach above the ocean’s surface
iceland a part of the mid- atlantic ridge is an example
the average temperature of surface water of the oceans is about °c and it gradually decreases from the equator towards the poles
the rate of decrease of temperature with increasing latitude is generally 
the average salinity of the indian ocean is %
the low salinity trend is observed in the bay of bengal due to influx of river water
on the contrary the arabian sea shows higher salinity due to high evaporation and low influx of fresh water
table  dissolved salts in sea water gm of salt per kg of water chlorine 
in hot and dry’ regions v’here evaporation is high the salinity sometimes reaches to %
the salinity variation in the pacific ocean is mainly due to its shape and larger areal extent
salinity decreases from % — % on the western parts of the northern hemisphere because of the influx of melted water from the arctic region
important terms  continent shelf the continental shelf is the extended margin of each continent occupied by relatively shallow seas and gulfs
it is the shallowest part of the ocean showing an average gradient of ° or even less
 thermocline the boundary region from where there is a rapid decrease of temperature is called the thermocline
 trenches these areas are the deepest parts of the oceans
the trenches are relatively steep sided narrow basins
they are some - km deeper than the surrounding ocean floor
 mid-oceanic ridges a mid-oceanic ridge is composed of two chains of mountains separated by a large depression
the  mountain ranges can have peaks as high as  m and some even reach above the ocean’s surface
 continental slope the continental slope connects the continental shelf and the ocean basins
it begins where the bottom of the continental shelf sharply drops off into a steep slope
the gradient of the slope region varies between -°
 seamount it is a mountain with pointed summits rising from the seafloor that does not reach the surface of the ocean
seamounts are volcanic in origin
these can be  —  m tall
 shelf break the shelf typically ends at a very steep slope called the shelf break
 submarine canyons these are deep valleys some comparable to the grand canyon of the colorado river
they are sometimes found cutting across the continental shelves and slopes often extending from the mouths of large rivers
the hudson canyon is the best known submarine canyon in the world
it shows evidences of gradual subsidence through stages to become flat topped submerged mountains
it is estimated that more than  seamounts and guyots exist in the pacific ocean alone
 atoll these are low islands found in the tropical oceans consisting of coral reefs surrounding a central depression
it may be a part of the sea lagoon or sometimes form enclosing a body of fresh brackish or highly saline water
 salinity salinity is the term used to define the total content of dissolved salts in sea water
it is calculated as the amount of salt in gm dissolved in  gm  kg of seawater
 halocline it is a distinct zone where salinity increases sharply
the horizontal and vertical motions are common in ocean water bodies
the horizontal motion refers to the ocean currents and waves
the vertical motion refers to tides
ocean currents are the continuous flow of huge amount of water in a definite direction while the waves are the horizontal motion of water
water moves ahead from one place to another through ocean currents while the water in the waves does not move but the wave trains move ahead
water particles only travel in a small circle as a wave passes
wind provides energy to the waves
wind causes waves to travel in the ocean and the energy is released on shorelines
the largest waves are found in the open oceans
waves continue to grow larger as they move and absorb energy from the wind
most of the waves are caused by the wind driving against water
waves may travel thousands of kilometers before rolling ashore breaking and dissolving as surf
a wave’s size and shape reveal its origin
the moon’s gravitational pull to a great extent and to a lesser extent the sun’s gravitational pull are the major causes for the occurrence of tides
another factor is centrifugal force which is the force that acts to counter balance the gravity
together the gravitational pull and the centrifugal force are responsible for creating the two major tidal bulges on the earth
on the side of the earth facing the moon a tidal bulge occurs while on the opposite side though the gravitational attraction of the moon is less as it is farther away the centrifugal force causes tidal bulge on the other side
the highest tides in the world occur in the bay of fundy in nova scotia canada
the tidal bulge is  –  m
because there are two high tides and two low tides every day roughly a  hour period then a tide must come in within about a six hour period
as a rough estimate the tide rises about  cm an hour  cm divided by  hours
the most common tidal pattern is semi-diurnal tide featuring two high tides and two low tides each day
the successive high or low tides are approximately of the same height
the height of rising water high tide varies appreciably depending upon the position of sun and moon with respect to the earth
when the sun the moon and the earth are in a straight line the height of the tide will be higher
these are called spring tides and they occur twice a month one on full moon period and another during new moon period
normally there is a seven day interval between the spring tides and neap tides
at this time the sun and moon are at right angles to each other and the forces of the sun and moon tend to counteract one another
once in a month when the moon’s orbit is closest to the earth perigee unusually high and low tides occur
during this time the tidal range is greater than normal
when the earth is farthest from the sun aphelion around th july each year tidal ranges are much less than average
usually the currents are strongest near the surface and may attain speeds over five knots
at depths currents are generally slow with speeds less than 
we refer to the speed of a current as its “drift
” drift is measured in terms of knots
the strength of a current refers to the speed of the current
a fast current is considered strong
a current is usually strongest at the surface and decreases in strength speed with depth
most currents have speeds less than or equal to  knots
surface currents constitute about  per cent of all the water in the ocean these waters are the upper  m of the ocean and deep water currents make up the other  per cent of the ocean water
these waters move around the ocean basins due to variations in the density and gravity
heating by solar energy causes the water to expand
that is why near the equator the ocean water is about  cm higher in level than in the middle latitudes
this causes a very slight gradient and water tends to flow down the slope
wind blowring on the surface of the ocean pushes the water to move
ocean currents are classified into cold currents and warm currents on the basis of temperature
cold-water ocean currents occur when the cold water at the poles sinks and slowly moves towards the equator
warm-water currents travel out from the equator along the surface flowing towards the poles to replace the sinking cold water
the mixing of warm and cold currents help to replenish the oxygen and favour the growth of planktons the primary food for fish population
the best fishing grounds of the world exist mainly in these mixing zones
important terms  waves waves are actually the energy not the water as such which moves across the ocean surface
 tides the periodical rise and fall of the sea level once or twice a day mainly due to the attraction of the sun and the moon is called a tide
 surges movement of water caused by meteorological effects winds and atmospheric pressure changes are called surges
the gravitational attraction of the moon and the centrifugal force
 tidal currents when the tide is channelled between islands or into bays and estuaries they are called tidal currents
 ebb the time between the high tide and low tide when the water level is falling is called the ebb
 flow or flood the time between the low tide and high tide when the tide is rising is called the flow or flood
 crest the highest point of a wave is called the crest  trough the lowest point of a wave is called trough
 wave height it is the vertical distance from the bottom of a trough to the top of a crest of a wave
 wave amplitude it is one-half of the wave height
 wave period it is merely the time interval between two successive wave crests or troughs as they pass a fixed point
 wavelength it is the horizontal distance between two successive crests
 wave speed it is the rate at which the wave moves through the water and is measured in knots
 wave frequency it is the number of waves passing a given point during a one second time interval
 semi-diurnal tide the most common tidal pattern featuring two high tides and two low tides each day
the successive high or low tides are approximately of the same height
 diurnal tide there is only one high tide and one low tide during each day
the successive high and low tides are approximately of the same height
 mixed tide tides having variations in height are known as mixed tides
these tides generally occur along the west coast of north america and on many islands of the pacific ocean
when the sun the moon and the earth are in a straight line the height of the tide will be higher
these are called spring tides
 perigee the time when the moon’s orbit is closest to the earth is called perigee
 apogee the time when the moon is farthest from earth is called apogee
 perihelion when the earth is closest to the sun
 aphelion when the earth is farthest from the sun  gyres gravity tends to pull the water down the pile and create gradient variation
the coriolis force intervenes and causes the water to move to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere
these large accumulations of water and the flow around them are called gyres
the biosphere includes all the living components of the earth
the biosphere and its components are very significant elements of the environment
these elements interact with other components of the natural landscape such as land water and soil
they are also influenced by the atmospheric elements such as the temperature rainfall moisture and sunlight
a german zoologist ernst haeckel who used the term as ‘oekologie’ in  became the first person to use the term ‘ecology’
the study of interactions between life forms biotic and the physical environment abiotic is the science of ecology
ecosystems are of two major types terrestrial and aquatic
terrestrial ecosystem can be further be classified into ‘biomes’
a biome is a plant and animal community that covers a large geographical area
the boundaries of different biomes on land are determined mainly by climate
from a structural point of view all ecosystems consist of abiotic and biotic factors
biotic factors include the producers the consumers primary secondary tertiary and the decomposers
the producers include all the green plants which manufacture their own food through photosynthesis
the primary consumers include herbivorous animals like deer goats mice and all plant-eating animals
the carnivores include all the flesh-eating animals like snakes tigers and lions
certain carnivores that feed also on carnivores are known as top carnivores like hawks and mongooses
generally two types of food-chains are recognised grazing food-chain and detritus food- chain
in a grazing food-chain the first level starts with plants as producers and ends with carnivores as consumers at the last level with the herbivores being at the intermediate level
the sun is the basic source of energy on which ail life depends
this energy’ initiates life processes in the biosphere through photosynthesis the main source of food and energy for green plants
out of the total solar insolation that reaches the earth’s surface only a very small fraction 
 per cent is fixed in photosynthesis
more than half is used for plant respiration and the remaining part is temporarily stored or is shifted to other portions of the plant
oxygen is the main by-product of photosynthesis
oxygen occurs in a number of chemical forms and combinations
it combines with nitrogen to form nitrates and with many other minerals and elements to form various oxides such as the iron oxide aluminium oxide and others
much of oxygen is produced from the decomposition of water molecules by sunlight during photosynthesis and is released in the atmosphere through transpiration and respiration processes of plants
other than carbon oxygen nitrogen and hydrogen being the principal geochemical components of the biosphere many other minerals also occur as critical nutrients for plant and animal life
important terms  biosphere the biosphere includes all the living components of the earth
 environment the environment is made up of abiotic and biotic components
 ecology the term ecology is derived from the greek word ‘oikos’ meaning ‘house’ combined with the word ‘logy’ meaning the ‘science of or ‘the study of
 habitat a habitat in the ecological sense is the totality of the physical and chemical factors that constitute the general environment
 ecosystem a system consisting of biotic and abiotic components is known as ecosystem
 ecological adaptation all these components in ecosystem are inter- related and interact with each other
different types of ecosystems exist with varying ranges of environmental conditions where various plants and animal species have got adapted through evolution
this phenomenon is known as ecological adaptation
 biotic factors biotic factors include the producers the consumers primary secondary tertiary and the decomposers
 producers the producers include all the green plants which manufacture their own food through photosynthesis
 primary consumers the primary consumers include herbivorous animals like deer goats mice and all plant-eating animals
 carnivores the carnivores include all the flesh-eating animals like snakes tigers and lions
certain carnivores that feed also on carnivores are known as top carnivores like hawks and mongooses
 biome a biome is a plant and animal community that covers a large geographical area
the boundaries of different biomes on land are determined mainly by climate
be defined as the total assemblage of plant and animal species interacting within specific conditions
 flow of energy transfer of energy that occurs during the process of a food chain from one level to another is known as flow of energy
 food web the food- chains get interlocked with one another
this inter- connecting network of species is known as food web
this is known as the water or hydrologic cycle
 oxygen cycle oxygen is the main by-product of photosynthesis
it is involved in the oxidation of carbohydrates with the release of energy carbon dioxide and water
the cycling of oxygen is a highly complex process
 denitrification some bacteria can even convert nitrites into nitrates that can be used again by green plants
there are still other types of bacteria capable of converting nitrates into free nitrogen a process known as denitrification
 succession this change is due to competition where the secondary forest species such as grasses bamboos or pines overtakes the native species changing the original forest structure
it is consistently richer in the tropics
as one approaches the polar regions one finds larger and larger populations of fewer and fewer species
genes are the basic building blocks of various life forms
the diversity in gene in a species is called genetic biodiversity
human beings genetically belong to the homo sapiens group and also differ in their characteristics such as height colour physical appearance etc
this is due to genetic diversity
this genetic diversity is essential for a healthy breeding of population of species
genetic diversity has given a great contribution in development of human culture
in a similar way human species has also contributed in maintaining natural diversity at genetic species and ecosystem level
different species of ecosystem are busy in one activity or the other
without activities they can neither survive nor develop
ecosystem evolves and sustains without any reason
ecological functions are important for ecosystem function and human survival
the more diverse an ecosystem better are the chances for the species to survive through adversities and attacks and consequently is more productive
just like a species with a high genetic diversity an ecosystem with high biodiversity may have a greater chance of adapting to environmental change
in other words the more the variety of species in an ecosystem the more stable the ecosystem is likely to be
biodiversity as we have today is the result of 
 billion years of evolution
before the advent of humans our earth supported more biodiversity than in any other period
since the emergence of humans however biodiversity has begun a rapid decline with one species after another bearing the brunt of extinction due to overuse
the number of species globally vary from  million to  million with  million being the best estimate
for all humans biodiversity is an important resource in their day-to-day life
biodiversity is seen as a reservoir of resources to be drawn upon for the manufacture of food pharmaceutical and cosmetic products
since the last few decades growth in human population has increased the rate of consumption of natural resources
it has accelerated the loss of species and habitation in different parts of the world
tropical regions which occupy only about one-fourth of the total area of the world contain about three- fourth of the world human population
over- exploitation of resources and deforestation have become rampant to fulfil the needs of large population
as these tropical rain forests contain  per cent of the species on the earth destruction of natural habitats have proved disastrous for the entire biosphere
natural calamities such as earthquakes floods volcanic eruptions forest fires droughts etc
cause damage to the flora and fauna of the earth bringing change to the biodiversity of respective affected regions
pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak and sensitive species
the international union of conservation of nature and natural resources iucn has classified the threatened species of plants and animals into three categories for the purpose of their conservation a endangered species b vulnerable species and c rare species
biodiversity is important for human existence
all forms of life are so closely interlinked that disturbance in one gives rise to imbalance in the others
if species of plants and animals become endangered they cause degradation in the environment which may threaten human being’s own existence
the government of india along with  other nations have signed the convention of biodiversity at the earth summit held at rio de janeiro brazil in june 
government of india passed the wild life protection act  under which national parks and sanctuaries were established and biosphere reserves declared
there are some countries which are situated in the tropical region they possess a large number of the world’s species diversity
they are called mega diversity centers
there are  such countries namely mexico columbia ecuador peru brazil democratic republic of congo madagascar china india malaysia indonesia and australia in which these centers are located
plants are important because these determine the primary productivity of an ecosystem
most but not all of the hotpots rely on species-rich ecosystems for food firewood cropland and income from timber
in madagascar for example about  per cent of the plants and animals are found nowhere else in the world
other hotspots in wealthy countries are facing different types of dangers
 genetic biodiversity genetic biodiversity refers to the variation of genes within species
 species diversity species diversity refers to the variety of species
it relates to the number of species in a defined area
the diversity of species can be measured through its richness abundance and types
 ecosystem diversity the broad differences between ecosystem types and the diversity of habitats and ecological processes occurring within each ecosystem type constitute the ecosystem diversity
 hotspots some areas are richer in species than others
areas rich in species diversity are called hotspots of diversity
 exotic species species which are not the natural inhabitants of the local habitat but are introduced into the system are called exotic species
 sensitive species pesticides and other pollutants such as hydrocarbons and toxic heavy metals destroy the weak species
these are called sensitive species
 mega diversity centre there are some countries which are situated in the tropical region they possess a large number of the world’s species diversity
they are called mega diversity centres
 endangered species endangered species includes those species which are in danger of extinction
the iucn publishes information about endangered species world-wide as the red list of threatened species
 vulnerable species vulnerable species includes the species which are likely to be in danger o’f extinction in near future if the factors threatening to their extinction continue
survival of these species is not assured as their population has reduced greatly
 rare species rare species are those species whose population is very small in the world and they are confined to limited areas or thinly scattered over a wider area
agriculture irrigation manufacturing power construction transport communication social infrastructure and services etc are are taken into consideration to which various sets of schemes or programmes are to be formulised and implemented
 regional planning approach in this approach the main emphasis is on to draw such plans which may help to reduce regional disparities and bring uniform economic development
target area planning the core focus of planning process is in promoting economically backward areas
it is important that for proper economic development of a region there is a need of resource base as well as technology and investment simultaneously because sometimes resources rich regions also remain backward
after having about one and half decade planning experience it is realised that our economic development is still facing the regional imbalances
in order to encounter both regional and social disparities the planning commission introduced the ‘target area’ and ‘target group approaches’ to planning
some of the programmes which are directed towards the development of these two approaches are as follows target area programmes target area has the following programmes such as 
command area development programme 
drought prone area development programme 
hill area development programme target group programmes target groups has the following programmes such as 
the small farmers development agency sfda 
planning related to area development programme hill area development programme  it covers  districts comprising all the hilly districts of uttar pradesh present uttarakhand mikir hill and north cachar hills of assam darjiling district of west bengal and nilgiri district of tamil nadu
it was stated in fifth five year plan
 it was recommended in  by the national committee on the development of backward area that the hill areas having a height above  m and not covered under tribal sub-plan be treated as backward hill areas
the aims of hill area development programmes are as follows 
development of horticulture plantation agriculture animal husbandry poultry forestry and small scale and village industry were the main objectives of the programme through which exploitation of local resources may become possible
the detailed plans were based on topographical ecological economic and social conditions of the hill areas
drought prone area programme dpap this programme was started during the fourth five year plan
the main objectives of drought prone area programme are as follows 
this plan mainly emphasised on generating employment opportunities to the people of drought prone areas along with creating productive assets
besides irrigation projects land development programmes afforestation grassland development and creation of basic rural infrastructure such as rural electrification roads market credit and services were also its main priorities
the national committee on development of backward areas found that this programme was mostly confined to the development of agriculture and allied sectors along with restoration of ecological balance
the society due to burden of population was bound to utilise the marginal lands for agriculture and as a result led ecological degradation
thus it was observed that there is an urgent need to generate alternative employment opportunities in these regions
 irrigation commission  demarcated the drought affected areas and also introduced the criterion of % irrigated land
 these areas are semi-arid and arid tract of rajasthan gujarat western madhya pradesh marathwada region of maharashtra rayalseema and telangana plateaus of andhra pradesh karnataka plateau and higlands and interior parts of tamil nadu
due to the advancement in irrigation facilities haryana punjab and northern rajasthan have become protected regions
integrated tribal development project in bharmaur region  the region lies between °  n and ° ′ n latitudes and ° ′ e and ° ′ e longitudes
spread over an area of about  sq km the region mostly lies between  m to  m above the mean sea level
 this region popularly known as the homeland of gaddis and is surrounded by lofty mountains on all sides
it has pir panjal in the north and dhaula dhar in the south
in the east the extension of dhaula dhar converges with pir panjal near rohtang pass
 these rivers divide the region into four physiographic divisions called holi khani kugti and tundah areas
bharmaurs experiences freezing weather conditions and snowfall in winter
it means monthly temperature in january remains °c and in july °c
area and life of people in bharmaur the area and life of people of bharmaur region are as follows 
the tribal area covers bharmaur and holi tehsils of chamba district of himachal pradesh
it is one of the most backward area economically as well as socially in himachal pradesh and also a notified tribal region since st november 
the area is occupied by a tribal group of community named ‘gaddi’ who practised transhumance and speak ‘gaddiali’ dialect
according to  census the total population of the area was  i
 persons per sq km
people of the area face major problems as the economy is mostly affected by its harsh climate low resource base and fragile environment
integrated tribal development project itdp  in s gaddis were included in the list of scheduled tribes and in the same period the development process of tribal area of this region started
 later in  under the fifth five year plan the tribal sub-plan was introduced and bharmaur was designed as one of the five integrated tribal development project itdp in himachal pradesh
aims and priorities of the intergrated tribal development project are as follows 
improving the quality of life of the gaddis
narrowing the gap in the level of development between bharmaur and other districts of himachal pradesh
the highest priority was on development of transport and communications agriculture and allied activities as well as social and community services
the main achievements of the tribal sub-plan are as follows infrastructural facilities infrastructural facilities of tribal sub-plan are as follows 
e schools health care facilities potable water roads communications and electricity supply
villages located along the river ravi in holi and khani areas are main beneficiaries infrastructural development
social benefits social benefits of tribal sub-plan are as follows 
there are tremendous increase in literacy rate e
g the female literacy rate in the region increased from 
% in  to % in 
decline in gender inequality i
between male and female literacy rate
some shortcomings to itdp 
in terms of infrastructural facilities the remote villages in tundah and kugti areas are still remained unaffected
the technology is still traditional in nature
the importance of pastoralism has been decreasing day-by-day as only about one tenth of the total households practice transhumance
but still a sizeable portion of the gaddis migrate to kangra and its fringing zone in order to earn living from wage labour during cold season
overview of planning perspective in india india has centralised planning and the planning commission has been assigned to administer the functions of planning in india
being a statutory body planning commission is headed by the prime minister and has a deputy chairman and members
five year plans are responsible to carry out the planning in india which are as follows  the first five year plan launched in  and covered the period - to -
 second and third five year plans covered the period from - to - and - to - respectively
 two successive droughts during mid sixties - and - and war with pakistan in  forced plan holiday in - and -
this period was covered by annual plans which are also termed as rolling plans
 the fourth five year plan began in - and ended in -
 following this the fifth five year plan began in - but it was terminated by the government one year earlier i
 the sixth five year plan took off in 
 the seventh five year plan covered the period between  and 
 once again due to the political instability and initiation of liberalisation policy the eighth five year plan got delayed
it covered the period from  to 
 the tenth five year plan began in  and ended in 
it was entitled ” towards faster and more inclusive growth”
 the twelfth five year plan in  and it is still in progress
it will come to an end in 
sustainable development  in the  this was the period when people throughout the world were much concerned about the environmental issues because of undesirable effects of industrial development and thus the concept of sustainable development emerged in western world
 this level of fear among environmentalists and common people reached at its peak with the publication of the population bomb’ by ehrlich in  and ‘the limits to growth’ by meadows aims of sustainable development  the main aim of sustainable development is to take care of economic social and ecological spheres of development during the present times as well as conserve all the resources in such a manner that these can be retain for future generations
 so there is a need of changing our attitude towards nature as well as economic development
concept of development  development is a dynamic concept and has evolved in the second half of twentieth century used to describe the state of particular societies and the process of changes experienced by them
 in early human history the main criteria of determination of a society’s state was the interaction process between human societies and their bio-physical environment
 societies helped in the development of various levels of technology and institutions upon which human-environment process depend
 these have helped in increasing the pace of human environment interaction therefore the momentum generated and festinated technological progress and transformation and creation of institutions
 after the period of world war ii the two important terms i
development and economic growth considered as one concept
but due to unequal distribution a faster rate of growth in poverty is experienced by even the developed nations having high economic growth
 then redistribution with growth and ‘growth and equity’ broaden the term development in s
 hence the concept of development has become multi-dimensional and stands for postive irreversible transformation of the economy society and environment
world commission on environment and development wced  the united nations established a world commission on environment and development wced after concerning the opinion of world community on the environmental issues
 the wced was headed by the norwegian prime minister gro harlem brundtland
the commission gave its report entitled ‘our common future’ in  also known as brundtland report
 in this report ‘sustainable development’ took into consideration and defined as ‘a development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs’
measures for promotion of sustainable development as we have seen that this project has affected the ecological sustainablity and physical environment of the region badly
so attaining the goal of sustainable development in command area requires such measures that can achieve ecological social and economic sustainabality simultaneously
hence five of the seven measures have been proposed in this respect such as 
rigorous implementation of water management policy is the first and foremost requirement of this project
stage i and stage ii comprising of protective irrigation and extensive irrigation for crops and pasture development respectively according to the canal project
by and large water intensive crops shall be avoided and plantation crops such as fruits shall be encouraged by folks
in order to reduce the conveyance loss of water few important programmes shall be taken into account such as the cad command area development programmes i
 lining of water courses
 land development and levelling
 warabandi system means equal distribution of canal water in the command area of outlet
the areas should be reclaimed that got affected by water logging and soil salinity
the eco-development is a must especially in the fragile environment of stage ii through afforestation shelterbelt plantation and pasture development activities
the economic sustainability can be attained through expanding the economic sector which must include agriculture and allied activities along with other economic sectors as a whole
hence we will then find diversification of economic base and establishment of functional linkages between basic villages agro-service centres and market centres
promotion of sustainable development in indira gandhi canal command area  it is one of the largest canal systems in india conceived by kanwar sain in 
this project was launched on st march  that transformed a desert into green land
 the origin place of the canal is at harike barrage in punjab state and goes parallel to pakistan border at an average distance of  km in thar desert of rajasthan marusthali
  km is the total planned length of the system catering to the irrigation needs of a total culturable command area of 
 the canal has two irrigation system such as ‘flow system’ and ‘lift system’
around % land of the command area is irrigated by flow system and rest % land by lift system
there are tw’o stages through which the construction work of the canal system has been done such as stage i of indra gandhi canal command area  this command area covers ganganagar hanumangarh and northern part of bikaner districts
 its culturable command area is 
 lakh hectares along with gentle undulating topography
 in this stage the irrigation system was introduced in early s
stage ii of indira gandhi canal command area this stage covers 
 lakh hectares cultarable area of bikaner jaisalmer barmer jodhpur nagpur and churu districts
the main characteristics of the area are 
hot desert with shifting sands dunes
irrigation system was introduced in this stage in mid- s
in the lift canal water is lifted up to make it to flow against the slope of the land
all the lift canals of this system originate at the left bank of main canal while all the canals on the right bank of main canal are flow channels
various afforestation and pasture development programme came into being
a considerable reduction in wind erosion and siltation of canal systems have also been recorded
 negative effect due to intensive irrigation and excessive use of water an alarming rate of water logging and soil salinity have been recorded
effects on agriculture there are some positive and negative effect on agriculture  positive effect this canal irrigation led to increase in cultivated land and intensity of cropping
wheat rice cotton groundnut replaced the drought resistant crops like gram bajra and jowar
 negative effect intensive irrigation has also became a cause of water logging and soil salinity
so in the near future it may hampers the sustainability of agriculture
major means of transportation are as follows land transport transportation of people and goods by road transport is not new in india
since ancient times pathways and unmetalled roads have been in use for this purpose
with the technological advancement there are now metalled roads railways cableways and pipelines for movement of large volume of goods and passengers
road transport india has its count in countries which is having largest road networks worldwide
india has a total road length of 
 lakhs km that places it among the countries which has largest road network
road transport carries about % of passenger and % of freight traffic every year
road transport is preferable for short distance travel
’ but due to lack of coordination among princely states and british india it remained unimplemented
the second attempt was made after independence with twenty year road plan  to improve the conditions of roads in india but still roads continue to concentrate in and around urban centres and rural and remote areas remained less connected by road
for the purpose of construction and maintenance roads are classified as national highways nh state highways sh major district roads and rural roads national highways  nh referred to roads which are constructed and maintained by central government
 national highways are meant for inter-state transport and movement of defence men and material in strategic areas
 in - total length of national highways was  km which was  km in 
 these highways connect the state capitals major cities important ports railways junctions etc and carry’ about % of the road traffic despite they constitute only 
% of total road length
 the national highways authority of india nhai – ^ is an autonomous body under the ministry of surface transport which is entrusted with the responsibility of development maintenance operation and for the improvement of the quality of national highways
national highways development projects  golden quadrilateral it is  km long  lane high density corridor
it was meant to connect india’s four big metro cities of delhi-mumbai- chennai-kolkata
it will deduct the time-distance and cost of movement among the mega cities of india
its construction help ip reducing the time distance and cost of movement among mega cities considerably
 north-south and east-west corridors the north-south corridor is a  km long highway which is meant to connect srinagar in jammu and kashmir with kanyakumari in tamil nadu including kochchi-salem spur
the east-west corridor is  km long road which aims to connect silchar in assam with the port town of porbandar in gujarat
state highways these roads are connected to the national highways and join the state capitals with district headquarters and other important towns
their share in the total road length is about %
state governments are responsible to construct and maintain these highways
district roads these roads connect district headquarters and other important nodes in the district
% of the total road length of the country
% of the total road length in india are categorised as rural roads
other roads these include border roads and international highways border roads these are strategically important roads along the northern and north-eastern boundary of the country
it was established in may  with the aim to accelerate economic development and strengthening defence preparedness through rapid and coordinated improvement of strategically important border roads
bro’s major achievement is construction of roads in high altitude mountainous terrain joining chandigarh with manali himachal pradesh and leh ladakh
this road is located at the average height of  meters above mean sea level
the total length of border roads was  km in  which was constructed by bro
besides the construction and maintenance of roads in strategically sensitive areas
the bro also undertakes snow clearance in high altitude area
international highways they are constructed with the aim to promote harmonious relationship with neighbouring countries and provide an effective connection with india
density of roads  the distribution of roads is not uniform in the country
density of roads length of roads per  sq km of area is the method to compare the network of roads of one area to another area
the national average road density is 
 the density of roads is influenced by nature of terrains and level of economic development
as most of the northern states and major southern states have high density of roads e
uttar pradesh has highest road density of 
 km whereas himalayan region north- eastern region madhya pradesh and rajasthan have low density of roads e
jammu and kashmir has lowest road density of 
 quality of roads besides density is also better in plains as compared to high altitude areas rainy and forested regions
rail transport  india has one of the longest railway network in the world
on one hand it facilitates the movement of freight and passengers and on the other hand it contributes to the growth of economy
 being the largest government undertaking in india indian railways network is  km long th march 
 to reduce the pressure of this large size railway from a centralised railway management system indian railway system has been divided into seventeen zones
these are as follows railway zone headquarters 
north east frontier maligaon guwahati 
western mumbai church gate 
metro kolkata gauges in indian railways indian railways has been divided into three categories
on the basis of the width of the track of indian railways as follows  broad gauge in broad gauge the distance between rails is 
the total length of broad gauge lines is  km in 
 metre gauge in metre gauge the distance between the rails is  metre
the total length of metre gauge is  km in 
 narrow gauge in narrow gauge the distance between the rails is 
the total length of narrow gauge line is  km in 
this category of railway lines is mostly found in the hilly areas
indian railways has taken major steps to improve the performance of this means of transport like 
to convert the metre and narrow gauges to broad gauge
replacement of steam engine by diesel and electric engines which may help in keeping the environment clean
introduction of metro rail in kolkata and delhi etc
development of railways in india was started by the britishers and after the independence scenario has been changed by extending railway routes to other areas
konkan railways along the western coast which provide a direct line between mumbai and mangalore was a significant development in this regard
konkan railway is one of the important achievements of indian railways which was constructed in 
it is a  km long rail route which connects roha in maharashtra to mangalore in karnataka
it is considered an engineering marvel
railway is still the most important means of transport for the masses
in the hill states north-eastern states central part of india and rajasthan railway network is relatively less dense
it is a fuel efficient and eco-friendly mode of transport
the water transport is of two types 
oceanic waterways inland waterways before the introduction of railways inland waterways was the chief mode of transport
but now it is losing its significance due to 
tough competition from road and railway transport
diversion of river water for irrigation purposes made them non-navigable in large parts of their courses
india has  km of navigable waterways which accounts for about % of country’s transportation
it includes rivers canals backwater creeks etc
at present  km of major rivers are navigable by mechanised flat bottom vessels but out of it only  are actually used
similiarly out of  km of the network of navigable canal only  km is navigable by mechanised vessels
the inland waterways authority which was setup in  is responsible for the development maintenance and regulation of national waterways in the country
currently there are three inland waterways which are considered as national waterways by the authority
the backwaters kadal of kerala has special significance which not only provides transport but also attract tourists here
the famous nehru trophy boat race vallamkali is also held in the backwaters
 these play an important role in the transport sector of india’s economy
 india’s vast coastline of about  km including islands easily facilitates this type of transport
there are twelve major and  minor ports which provide infrastructural support to these routes
 about % of india’s foreign trade by volume and % by value moves through ocean routes
 these routes give international trade service as well as provide transportation between the islands and the rest of the country
it is good for long distances and areas which have uneven terrain and climatic conditions
air transport in india was started in  with a short distance  km airmail operation from allahabad to nairn
the airport authority of india is responsible for providing safe efficient air traffic and aeronautical communication services in the indian air space
now it manages  airports including  international  domestic and  civil enclaves at defence air fields
there are two corporations air india and indian airlines which manage air transport in india
both corporations were nationalised in 
now many private companies have also started passenger services
air india it is a corporation of india which provides international air service for both passengers and cargo traffic
it connects all the continents of the world through its services
indian airlines indian airlines the largest state owned domestic carrier changed its names to ‘indian by dropping’ word ‘airlines’ in th december 
the new brand name ‘indian’ now appears on both sides of the fuselage
the logo depicting ia which was used to be display on orange tail is now replaced by a new logo
new logo is apartly visible blue wheel and is inspired by the sun temple at konark odisha symbolising timeless motion convergence and divergence
it also represents strength as well as trust that has stood the test of time
history of indian airlines  -air transport in india was launched between allahabad and naini
 -air transport was provided by four major companies namely indian national airways tata sons limited air services of india and deccan airways
 -four more companies joined the services i
bharat airways himalayan aviation limited airways india and kalinga airlines
 -air transport was nationalised and two corporations air india international and indian airlines were formed
now indian airlines is known as indian
oil and gas pipelines pipelines are convenient and best means of transporting liquids and gases over long distances
these can also transport solids after converting them into slurry
oil india limited oil is responsible for exploration production and transportation of crude oil and natural gas
this pipeline covers a distance of  km from naharkatiya oil field in assam to barauni refinery in bihar
in  this pipeline was further extended to kanpur uttar pradesh
in western region of india oil also constructed extensive network of pipelines – ankleshwar-koyali mumbai high-koyal and hazira-vijaipur-jagdishpur hvj pipelines
recently a pipeline is also constructed from salaya gujarat to mathura uttar pradesh
it is  km long pipeline which transport crude oil from gujarat to punjab jalandhar via mathura
construction of a  km long pipeline from numaligarh to siliguri is also in progress
communication networks a number of communication cum-transportation means have been used since human history for e
messages ware delivered by beating drum or hollow tree trunks giving indication through smoke or fire or with the help of fast runners
development in the field of science and technology brought many revolutionary inventions in means of communication like post office telegraph printing press telephone satellite etc
on the basis of scale and quality the mode of communication can be divided into following categories personal communication system  the most advanced and best means among all personal communication system is internet which is widely used in urban cities
 e-mail is the main source through which a user can directly connect with others and can also get access to the world of knowledge and information
 use of internet is increasing for e-commerce and carrying out money transactions
 the internet is like a huge control warehouse of data with detailed information on various items
 it is a cheaper mode of communication which provides an efficient access to information at a comparatively low cost
 letters telephone fax are also used for personal communication
mass communication system radio  radio broadcasting was started in  by radio club of bombay
within short time it gained immense popularity and became a part of every househod in india
 after seeing its popularity the government of india in  took the control of this mode of communication under indian broadcasting system
 it was changed to all india radio in  and to akashwani in 
television tv  television tv broadcasting has emerged as the most effective audio-visual medium for disseminating information and educating masses
 first television broadcasting was started in national capital in 
till  it was the only urban place where tv services were available
 after  several other centres became operational
in  tv broadcasting services were separated by all india radio and got a separate identity as doordarshan dd
 its revolutionary development began after the launch of insat-ia national television -d when common national programmes cnp were started for the entire network and its services were extended to the backward and remote rural areas
satellite communication satellite is an advanced mode of communication
they also regulate the use of other means of communication
from economic and strategic point of view use of satellite is very vital for the country as these give continuous and synoptic view larger area
various operations can be done through satellite images e
weather forcast monitoring of natural calamities surveillance of border areas etc
there are two satellite system in india on the basis of configuration and purposes indian national satellite system insat this was established in 
it is a multi-purpose satellite system for telecommunication meteorological observatioon and for various other data and programmes
indian remote sensing satellite system irs  the irs satellite system started in india with the launch of irs-ia in march  from vaikanour in russia
 india has also developed her indigenous launching vehicle pslv polar satellite launch vehicle
 these remote sensing satellites collect data in several spectral band and transmit them to ground stations which is very useful in the management of natural resources and other various purposes
 the national remote sensing agency nrsa at hyderabad is responsible for facilitating for acquisition of data and its processing
there is a decline in the share of agriculture and allied products whereas shares of petroleum and crude products and other commodities have increased
the share of petroleum products has increased mainly because of the rise in petroleum prices and increase in the petroleum refining capacity of india
 a huge decline is registered in the export of traditional items like coffee spices tea pulses etc due to the tough international competition
though an increase has been registered in floricultural products fresh fruits marine products and sugar etc
but manufacturing sector alone accounted for % of india’s total value of export in -
 the major competitors of india are china and other east asian countries
apart from this the gems and jewellery are other commodities that have larger share in india’s international trade
changing patterns of the composition of india’s import  during s and s india faced serious food shortage thus the country had to import food grain capital goods machinery and equipments at large scale
 the balance of payment was adverse as imports were more than export inspite of all the efforts of imports substitution
 after s the success of green revolution discontinued the food grain import
but the energy crises of  replaced the import of food grains by fertilizers and petroleum as the prices of petroleum had been raised
 besides other imported goods were machine and equipment special steel edible oil and chemicals
 according to economic survey - petroleum products have registered a rapid increase in import goods
 it is a raw material for petrochemical industries and also used as fuel
the increase signifies the tempo of rising industrialisation and improvement in standard of living
 periodic price rise of petroleum in the international market may be another reason for this increase
 import of capital goods like non-electrical machinery transport equipment manufactures of metals and machine tools registered a steady increase
this increase could be because of increasing demand in the export oriented industrial and domestic sectors
 pearls and semi-precious stones gold and silver metalliferrous ores and metal scrap non- ferrous metals electronic goods etc are other important items of india’s import
direction of trade  india is a trading partner with most of the countries and major trading blocks of the world
 india has goal to double its share in international trade within the next  years
to achieve this objective india has started to adopt suitable measures which includes import liberalisation reduction in import duties de-licensing and change from process to product patents
 india has created an example in terms of percentage of asia and asean association of south-east asian nations in total trade of world has increased
% in - and it increased to 
in contrast to this the share of europe and america decreased from 
this has helped india to survive during the global crisis in europe and america
 with the development of india’s trade direction india’s trading share with different countries also changed
during  - usa was india’s largest trading partner
now uae has displaced usa as it was india’s largest trading partner during -
 after uae china is the second largest trading partner with india continuing this position from - to -
usa has sliped to third position
 india’s foreign trade is mainly carried through oceanic and air routes
foreign trade via land route is only limited to the neighbouring countries such as nepal bhutan bangladesh and pakistan
sea ports as gateways of international trade  india has a long history of international trade via sea ports as it has long coastline and is opened to sea from three sides
water provides smooth surface and cheap transport without any hinderance
 india has developed many ports on its coast
these ports are named with suffix ‘pattan’ meaning port
it is interesting to know that india has more sea ports on west coast than its east coast
 after coming of the european traders and colonisation of the country by the british the indian ports have emerged as gateways of international trade
major and minor ports  at present india has  major and  minor or intermediate ports
for major ports central government is responsible for deciding the policies and regulate their functions and for minor ports state government is responsible for the same functions stated above
 a larger port of total traffic is handled by major ports e
about % of the india’s oceanic traffic was handled by the the  major ports during -
 the britishers used these ports to export natural resources of india particularly from their hinterland but this trend was discontinued after 
 the india lost its two very important ports i
karachi port to pakistan and chittagong port to bangladesh erstwhile east-pakistan
but india recovered successfully from this loss by opening many new ports for instance kandla in the west and the diamond harbour near kolkata on river hugli in the east
 today large volumes of domestic and international trade are handled by these indian ports
most of the ports are equipped with modem infrastructure
 previously it was expected that government agencies are responsible for the development and modernisation of indian ports
but it was considered that there is a need to increase the functions and bring these ports at par with the international ports
thus private entrepreneurs have been invited for the modernisation of ports in the country
 the cargo handling capacity of indian ports increased from  million tonnes in  to more than tnillion tonnes at present
important ports some of the indian ports along with their hinterlands are as follows kandla port  this port is situated at the head of gulf of kuchchh
the main objectives of this major port are to serve the needs of western and north-western ports of the country and also to reduce the pressure at mumbai port
 this port is mainly designed to receive large quantities of petroleum and petroleum products and fertilizers
 to reduce the pressure at kandla port an offshore terminal named vadinar has also been developed
mumbai port  this is a natural harbour and the biggest port of india
 the location of this port is closer to the general routes from the countries of middle east mediterranean countries north africa north america and europe where the major share of country’s overseas trade is carried out
 this port is extended over a large area with the length of  km and width of - km with  berths and has the country’s largest oil terminal
 the main hinterlands of this port are madhya pradesh maharashtra gujarat uttar pradesh and some parts of rajasthan
jawaharlal nehru port  this satellite port is located at nhava sheva
it was developed to relieve the pressure at the mumbai port
 it is the largest container port in india
marmagao port  it is located at the entrance of the zuari estuary which is a natural harbour in goa
it gained significance after its remodelling in  to handle iron-ore exports to japan
 construction of konkan railway extended its hinterland e
karnataka goa southern maharashtra constitute its hinterland
new mongalore port  it is mainly used to export iron-ore and iron concentrates and other commodities like fertilizers petroleum products edible oils coffee tea wood pulp yam granite stone molasses etc
 it is located in karnataka which is its major hinterland
kochchi port  this port is popularly known as ‘queen of the arabian sea’
 it is a natural harbour and situated at the head of vembanad koyal
 kochchi port is located close to the suez-colombo route
 it serves the needs of kerala southem-kamataka and south-western tamil nadu
this port was developed by the british as it was once the capital of british india
 the port has lost its significance considerably on account of the diversion of exports to the other ports such as vishakhapatnam paradwip and satellite port haldia
 it is also facing the problem of silt accumulation in the hugli river which hinders the link to the sea
 its hinterland covers uttar pradesh bihar jharkhand west bengal sikkim and the north-eastern states
 it also provides port facilities to our neighbouring land-locked countries such as nepal and bhutan
haldia port  it is located  km downstream from kolkata
 it has been constructed to reduce the congestion at kolkata port
 it handles bulk cargo like iron-ore coal petroleum petroleum products and fertilizers jute jute products cotton and cotton yarn etc
paradwip port  the port is located in the mahanadi delta and it is about  km far from cuttack
 it has advantage of having the deepest harbour thus it is best suited to handle very large vessels
 it mainly handles large scale export of iron-ore
 odisha chhattisgarh and jharkhand constitute its hinterland
vishakhapatnam port  it is a land locked harbour situated in andhra pradesh
 it is connected to the sea by a channel which is cut through solid rock and sand
 to handle various commodities like iron-ore petroleum and general cargo an outer harbour has been developed
 andhra pradesh is the main hinterland for this port
it was built in 
 because of the shallow water near the coast it is not suitable for large ships
 tamil nadu and puducherry constitute its hinterland
ennore port  this newly developed port is situated  km north of chennai
 it was developed to minimise the pressure at chennai port
tuticorin port  it is another port which was developed to relieve the pressure of chennai port
 this port handles a number of commodities like coal salt food grains edible oils sugar chemicals and petroleum products
airports air transport plays a significant role in the international trade of a nation
the advantages are follows 
air transport is very useful for handling high value or perishable goods over long distance
it takes less time to transport cargo
the disadvantages are as follows 
air transportation is very costly
it is not suitable for the transportation of heavy and bulky commodities
thus having these disadvantages air transport is notless preferred for international trade as compared to oceanic routes
at present there are  international airports
they are ahmedabad amritsar bengalura chennai delhi goa guwahati hyderabad kochchi kolkata mumbai and thiruvananthapuram
apart from these there are  domestic airports in india
it is of various types
the classification of pollution are as follows 
land pollution water pollution quality of water is majorly degraded by a number of factors i
indiscriminate use of water by fast growing population and expansion of industries
water becomes polluted when quantity of these substances increases in it
it becomes unsuitable for human uses and its self purifying capacity declines
there are two sources of water pollution  natural erosion landslides decay and decomposition of plants and animals etc are natural sources that make water polluted
 human industrial agricultural and cultural activities of human beings make water polluted
water pollution created from human beings are major problem in modern times
sources of pollution in the ganga and the yamuna rivers most of the industrial wastes e
major culprits are leather pulp and paper textiles and chemicals industries
these chemicals pollute surface water such as rivers lakes tanks as well as groundwater by infiltrating into the soil
these fertilizers increase the amount of nitrate content of surface waters
besides this cultural activities such as pilgrimage religious fairs tourism etc also cause water pollution
in india almost all surface water sources are contaminated and unfit for human consumption
use of polluted water can harm human health and can cause various water borne diseases e
diarrhoea intestinal worms hepatitis etc
air pollution a larger proportion of contaminants like dust fumes gas fog odour smoke or vapour in air for a long duration is known as air pollution may be harmful to flora and fauna and to property
there is an increase in emission of poisonous gases into the atmosphere because of increasing use of various fuels for energy in various sectors thus resulting in the pollution of air
the main sources of air pollution are combustion of fossil fuels mining and industries which release oxides of sulphur and nitrogen hydrocarbons carbon dioxide carbon monoxide lead and asbestos
effects of air pollution the effects of air pollution are as follows 
air pollution is responsible for many diseases related to our respiratory nervous and circulatory systems
air pollution is responsible for creating smoky fog over cities which is known as urban smog
it has negative effects on human health
air pollution is also responsible for acid rain
first rain after summer in urban areas always shows high acidic nature of rain water i
it shows lower ph level than the subsequent rain
noise pollution noise pollution refers to a noise that causes a condition which is unbearable and uncomfortable to human beings
this noise can be from various sources
it is a recent phenomenon which became a serious concern only after a variety of technological innovations
the level of steady noise is measured by sound level expressed in terms of decibels db
factories mechanised construction and demolition works automobiles and aircrafts are major sources of noise that cause noise pollution
apart from these there are also some periodic sources of noise pollution such as sirens loudspeakers in different festivals and programmes and other activities of different communities
noise produced by traffic is a major source of noise pollution
it creates a huge inconvenience to the people
in sea traffic the noise pollution is limited to the harbour because of loading and unloading activities of containers
noise pollution from industries is also a serious problem but its intensity varies because of some factors such as type of industry types of machines and tools etc
the intensity of noise pollution decreases as distance from source of pollution industrial areas arteries of transportation airport etc increases
thus noise pollution is location specific
effects of noise pollution noise pollution is a major cause of anxiety tension and some other mental problems and disorders among people in many metropolitan and big cities in india
urban waste disposal overcrowding congestion increasing population improper infrastructure and facilities to support this population lack of sanitation foul air etc are some features of urban areas
mismanagement of solid wastes and environmental pollution caused by them has now become a major problem
solid wastes are a variety of old and used articlesfor e
stained small pieces of metals broken glass wares plastic containers polythene bagsashes floppies cds etc dumped at different places
these discarded materials are also known as refuses garbage and rubbishetc and are disposed off from two sources i
household or domestic establishments and industrial or commercial establishments
public lands or private contractor’s sites are used to disposed off household or domestic wastes
low lying public grounds landfill areas are used to disposed off industrial solid wastes by public municipal facilities
industries thermal power houses and building constructions and demolitions are contributing with more turn out of ashes and debris in solid wastes
disposal of industrial wastes has increased because of the concentration of industrial units in and around urban centres
urban waste is a bigger problem in small towns and cities than metropolitan cities in the country
about % of solid waste is collected and disposed off successfully in mumbai kolkata chennai bangalore and other metropolitan cities
about -% solid wastes in other towns and cities in country is not collected and disposed off properly
it is a major problem because it accumulates on streets in open spaces between houses and in wastelands and can cause various health problems
impacts of improper management of solid wastes improper management of solid wastes has following impacts 
solid wastes are threat to human health and can cause various diseases
it creates foul smell and it harbours flies and rodents that can cause typhoid diphtheria diarrhoea malaria cholera and other diseases
solid waste can create inconvenience rapidly if they are not properly handled
wind and rain water can splitted it and cause a discomfort to people
industrial solid waste can cause water pollution by dumping it into water bodies
drains carrying untreated sewage also result into various health problems
untreated waste release various poisonous biogases such as methane in air by slow fermentation process
these wastes are resources as energy can be generated from them by compositing these wastes problem of energy could be solved as well as its management in urban areas
rural-urban migration movement of people from rural area to urban area are caused by various factors such as high demand for labour in urban areas low job opportunities in rural areas and disparities in terms of development in rural and urban areas
smaller and medium cities provide low opportunities which force people to bypass these small cities and directly come to the mega cities for their livelihood
mostly daily wage workers like welders carpenter etc move to another cities for work periodically and provide remittances to their families for daily consumption health care schooling of children etc
this has improved their early abject situation into a better one
simultaneously due to temporary and transferable job situation these labourers and their families hear the pain of separation of their near and dear ones
sometimes these workers also face difficulty in assimilation to the new culture and environment
due to these menial jobs at low wages in informal sector in urban areas the spouses are left behind in rural areas to look after children and elderly people
thus the rural-urban migration stream is dominated by the males
trend of urbanisation in the world currently about % of the world’s  billion  population lives in urban areas of world
this proportion of urban population will increase in future
it is estimated that between  to  this percentage would be grown with 
this high urban population will pressurise governments to optimise infrastructure facilities in urban areas for giving a standard quality of life
it is estimated that by  about two-thirds of the world’s population will live in urban areas
it would create a high pressure on existing infrastructure and sanitation health crime problems and urban poverty
there are various factors responsible for growth of urban population 
when high birth rate and low morality rate increase
net in-migration or movement of people from other areas
reclassification of urban areas to encompass formerly rural settlements
in india there is a estimation that about % india’s urban population has increased after 
about % of this growth has been caused by rural-urban migration
they are also defined differently in different countries
 these two are differentiated by their functions but sometimes interdependent on each other
these two concepts are also divided in terms of their separate cultural economic and technological aspects
 according to  census about % of india’s population is rural according to  rural population is 
most of these rural areas are still in poor conditions and perform primary activities
 according to mahatama gandhi villages are ideal republics
these work as supplement to the core urban centre forming its hinterland
 urban areas are more developed in terms of the socio-economic politico-cultural etc than other areas
 urban areas have farm house high income of people and their localities wide roads street lights water and sanitation facilities lawns well developed green belts parks playgrounds and other facilities provisions for individual security and right of privacy
 apart from these attractions urban areas also have slums jhuggi jhopari’ clusters and colonies of shanty-structures
 these are environmentally incompatible and degraded areas of the cities
these are occupied by the migrants who were forced to migrate from rural areas to urban areas for employment and livelihood
but because of high rent and high costs of land they could not afford proper housing and start to live in these areas
characteristics of slums slums have following characteristics 
slums are least choice residential areas that have broken down house bad hygienic conditions poor ventilation and does not have basic facilities like drinking water light and toilet facilities etc
slums are overcrowded with people and have many narrow street patterns prone to serious hazards from fire
they face various health related problems such as malnutrition illness and prone to various diseases
they are not able to send their children school to provide them education because of low level of income
dwellers are vulnerable to drug abuse alcoholism crime vandalism escapism apathy and social exclusion because of poverty
land degradation the limited availability and deterioration of quality of land both are responsible to exert pressure on agricultural land
soil erosion water logging salinisation and alkalinisation of land lead to land degradation which declines productivity of land
in simple words temporary or permanent decline in productive capacity of the land is known as land degradation
all degraded land may not be considered as wasteland
but if process of degradation is not checked then a degraded land may be converted into wasteland
natural and man-made processes both degrade the quality of land
it classifies wastelands by using remote sensing techniques on the basis of the processes that have created them
 wasteland caused by natural agents gullied ravinous land desertic or coastal sand barren rocky areas steep sloping land glacial areas etc are types of wastelands caused by the natural agents
these are considered as wastelands caused by natural agents
 wasteland caused by natural as well as human factors water logged and marshy areas land affected by salinity and alkalinity and land with and without scrubs which are degraded by the natural as well as human factors are included in this category
 wastelands caused by man-made processes shifting cultivation area degraded land under plantation crops degraded forests degraded pastures and mining and industrial wastelands are some types of wastelands that are degraded because of human action
 the elements like villages cities road-rail networks etc and all other elements of material culture have been created by human beings using the resources provided by the physical environment
thus in the saying of ellen semple “human geography is a study of changing relationship between unresting man and unstable earth”
naturalisation of humans and humanisation of nature  humans interact with their physical environment with the help of technology
this indicates the level of cultural development
 the interaction of primitive societies with the physical environment is termed as environmental determinism which is naturalisation of humans
 with the development of technology humans began to modify nature and created cultural landscape
this is called possiblism or humanisation of nature
 a middle path of neo determinism was introduced by griffith taylor which means that neither is there a situation of absolute necessity environmental determinism nor is there a condition of absolute freedom possibilism
history of human geography  the emergence of human geography started with the interaction adaptation adjustment and modification between the humans and the environment
 before the age of discovery there was very little interaction between different societies but in the late th century information about the unknown societies were made available now
exploration by travellers expanded the area of human geography and interacted with different societies
 with this new approaches can across like welfare or humanistic school of thought radical school of thought and behavioural school of thought
field and sub-fields of human geography  human geography is inter-disciplinary in nature and develops vast linkages with other sister disciplines in social sciences
population is not evenly distributed as  percent of the world’s population lives in about  percent of its land area
out of these  countries  are located in asia
density of population  this means the ratio between the number of people to the size of the land
it is usually measured in persons per sq km density of populationarea
some areas are densely populated like north-eastern usa north-western europe south south-west and east asia
 some areas are sparsely populated like near the polar areas and high rainfall zones near the equator while some areas have medium density like western china southern india norway sweden etc
factors influencing population distribution the population distribution is influenced by three factors i
 geographical factors economic factors and social and cultural factors
geographical factors environmental or natural factors such as landforms fertile soil suitable climate for cultivation and availability of adequate source of fresh water are the geographical factors that affect the population distribution
some geographical factors are land forms flat plains and gentle slopes are preferred by people because these are favorable for the production of crops and to build roads and industries
climate area with less seasonal variation attract more people
soil area which have fertile loamy soil have more people living on them as these can support intensive agriculture
water people prefer to live in areas where fresh water is easily available
because it is the most important factor for life
economic factors places having employment opportunities like  mineral rich areas industrial units and urban centres have high concentration of population
some economic factors are industrialisation industries provide job opportunities and attract large numbers of ‘ people
minerals minerals deposits attract industries  mining and industrial activities generate employment
urbanisation good civic amenities and the attention of city life draw people to the cities
social and cultural factors places having religious importance and cultural significance are also very densely populated areas
when change in population is expressed in percentage then it is called growth rate of population
when there is an increase in population by taking the difference between births and deaths then it is called natural growth of population
there is also positive growth of population which happens when birth rate is more than death rate and negative growth of population when birth rate is lower than death rate
components of population change there are three components of population change i
 births deaths and migration
crude birth rate cbr number of births in a year per thousand of population is expressed as crude birth rate cbr
it is calculated as here bi= live births during the year p = mid year population of the area
crude death rate cdr number of deaths in a year per thousand of population is expressed as crude death rate cdr
it is calculated as here d= number of deaths p= estimated mid-year population of that year
migration it is movement of people across region on permanent temporary or seasonal basis
the place they move is called place of origin and the place they move to is called place of destination
push and pull factors of migration the push factors make the place of origin seem less attractive for reasons like unemployment poor living conditions political turmoil unpleasant climate natural disasters epidemics and socio- economic backwardness
the pull factors make the place of destination seem more attractive than the place of origin for reasons like better job opportunities and living condition eace and stability security of life and property and pleasant climate
 about  to  years ago world population was  million and now it has reached to  billion
 in every  years  billion people are added
increased agriculture and industrial production inoculation against epidemics improvement in medical facilities have reduced death rates
doubling time of world population  developed countries are taking more time to double their population as compared to developing countries
 oman saudi arabia somalia liberia yemen have high population growth rates while latvia estonia russia germany etc have low growth rates
spatial pattern of population change  the world population growth rate is 
% it is highest in africa i
% and lowest in europe i
% means neither grow nor decline
 so even when a small annual rate is applied to very large population it will lead to a large population change
there is negative correlation between economic development and population growth
impact of population change high increase in population leads to problems like depletion of natural resources unemployment and scarcity
decline in population indicates that resources are insufficient to maintain a population
demographic transition theory this theory studies the changes in the population of a region as it moves from high births and high deaths to low births and low deaths
this happens when a society progresses from rural agrarian and illiterate to urban industrial and literate
there are three-staged model of demographic transition theory
they are first stage  this stage is marked by high fertility high mortality rate because people reproduce more to compensate for the deaths due to epidemics and variable food supply
life expectancy is low and population growth is slow
second stage  level of technology increases and other facilities like medical health sanitation improves due to which the death rate reduces
 but the fertility rate and birth rate remains high due to which there is huge rise in population
population expands rapidly as there is wide gap between birth and death rate
third stage  the birth and death rate both reduces and the population moves towards stability
 people become literate urbanised and control the size of the family
there is good judicious use of technology also
population control measures  family planning is the spacing and preventing the birth of children
thomas malthus theory  states that the number of people would grow faster than the food supply thus leading to famine diseases and war
 therefore it is essential to control the population
this is undertaken through measures like awareness for family planning free availability of contraceptives tax disincentives and active propaganda
it is taken out as a sex ratio which is the ratio between the number of men and women
it is calculated by the formula  sex ratio in the world is  females per  males’with highest in latvia  females per  males and lowest in uae  females per  males
 the sex ratio is unfavourable in  countries of the world as there is gender discrimination leading to female foeticide female infanticide as well as low economic status of women
age structure the age structure of a population refers to the number of people of different age groups
it is divided into three groups i
children - years adult or working population - years and old or ageing population  years and above
age-sex pyramid the age-sex pyramid refers to the number of females and males in different age groups
the characteristic of a population is shown by population pyramid
the pyramid is interpreted in the following ways expanding population a triangular pyramid with a wide base due to high birth rate is mostly in less developed countries like nigeria mexico and bangladesh
constant population a bell shaped pyramid and tapered towards the top shows almost equal birth and death rates like in australia
declining population a pyramid with narrow base and top wife a wider central part shows low birth and death rates
this is in developed countries like japan
rural urban composition  the division of rural and urban areas based on residence indicates the pattern of occupations and social conditions
people are predominantly engaged in primary activities in rural areas while in urban areas majority of working population is engaged in non-primary activities
 in developed countries like canada west european countries females outnumber males in urban areas while in developing countries like nepal and pakistan it is vice versa
literacy  level of literate population of a country indicates the standard of living social status of females availability of educational facilities
 in india literacy rate is the percentage of population above  years who are able to read write and do arithmetic calculations
occupational structure  this is proportional distribution of working population age group  to  in various occupations
agriculture forestry fishing and mining are classified under primary activities
 manufacturing as secondary activity transport communication and other services as tertiary and jobs related to research and developing ideas are quaternary activities
therefore development is always positive
 development cannot take place unless there is an increment or addition to the existing conditions but growth can be positive negative or neutral positive growth does not always led to development
 development occurs when there is a positive change in qualities
earlier economic growth and development of country was seen as one but now they are studied separately
human development  this concept was introduced by dr mahbub-ul-haq in 
human development is described as that which enlarges people’s choices and improves their lives thus creating conditions where people can lead meaningful lives
 this means that people develop talent participate in society and be free to achieve their goals
amartya sen the main objective of development is an increase in freedom
freedom to make choices brings development and social and political institutions play a major role in increasing freedom
 building people capabilities in health education and equal access to resources increases freedom and enlarges choices
four pillars of human development the idea of human development is supported by the concepts of the following four pillars of development equity it refers to equal access to opportunities available to everybody irrespective to their gender race income and caste
sustainability it means continuity in the availability of opportunities so that future generations can even use the present resources
productivity it means human labour which must be enriched by building capabilities in people
empowerment it means having the power to make choices which is possible by increasing freedom and capability
some of the important approaches are income approach this approach links the development to incomes as it believes that income determines the level of freedom that one enjoys
welfare approach under this approach government is responsible for providing basic facilities like health education and amenities to people
basic needs approach in this approach emphasis is on providing six basic needs i
health education food water supply ” sanitation and housing
capability approach this approach is associated with prof
amartya sen and aims to build human capabilities in health education and-access to resources in order to increase human development
measuring human development following are the ways of measuring human development human development index  human development is measured through human development index hdi which ranks the countries between  to  based on their performance in the key areas of health education and access to resources
 it is the sum total of the weights assigned to health education and access to resources
indicator to access health is life expectancy at birth to access knowledge it is adult literacy rate and gross enrollment ratio and resources are measured in terms of purchasing power human poverty index this index measures the shortfall in human development
the index is based on the probability of not surviving till  adult literacy rate people not having access to clean drinking water and number of underweight children
united nations development programme the united nations development programme undp since  publishes the human development report by measuring the human development index and human poverty index
gross national happiness this is gross national happiness gnh which is another measure of accessing human development and bhutan is the only country in the world to measure the country’s progress through gnh
the gnh encourages the qualitative aspect of development
 for comparisons the countries are classified into four groups on the basis of human development scores earned by them
very high level of human development  the countries scoring above 
 are categorised under it
there are  countries in this group
 top ten countries with very high value index are norway australia netherlands united states new zealand canada ireland liechtenstein germany and sweden
 the countries in this group provide education and healthcare which is an important government priority as well as invest a lot in the social sector
high level of human development  countries scoring between 
 are grouped under it
they are  in number
 good governance and lot of investment in social sector has led to high level of human development in these countries
medium level of human development  countries scoring between 
 are grouped under it and there are  countries in this group
‘  many of these countries were former colonies and are facing political instability as well as high social diversity
low level of human development  countries scoring below 
 are grouped under it and there are  countries in it
these countries are going through political turmoil social instability civil war famine or high incidence of diseases
 internal comparisons reveal that the culture religion or community are non-determinants of human development
rather pattern of government expenditure on the social sector political environment amount of freedom people have and the distribution of resources play a decisive role in the level of human development
early man lived in forests and sustained his life by hunting animals
he has also been gathering various products from the forests to satisfy his needs in early days
thus early men sustained on edible plants which they hunted and edible plants which they gathered from the forests
 early human beings practised these activities with the help of primitive tools made of stones twigs or arrows so the number of animals killed was limited
but now modem equipments led to the widespread poaching of animals due to which hunting is declared illegal
 gathering is practised in high latitude zones oi north canada northern eurasia and southern chile low latitude zones of amazon basin tropical africa interiors of south-east asia
this activity requires small capital investment and low level of technology
valuable plants leaves bark etc are collected and after simple processing they are sold in local markets
these products cannot compete the world market as synthetic products are lower in price and of better quality
pastoralism  this means domestication and rearing of animals on pastures
this is carried either at subsistence level known as nomadic herding or at commercial level known as commercial livestock rearing
nomadic herding  also called pastoral nomadism it is a primitive activity where herders move with their livestock from one place to another in search of food and water
they rely on animals for food clothing shelter tools and transport
 depending on geographical factors different animals are reared in different regions like cattle in tropical africa sheep goat and camel in sahara asiatic deserts yak llamas in tibet and andes reindeer in arctic and sub-arctic areas
other areas include mongolia central china eurasia south-west africa and madagascar
this activity is done on vast ranches that are permanent
 modem scientific technology with emphasis on breeding genetic improvement disease control and health care is done
production of meat wool hides is done and exported to different world markets
 sheep cpttle goat and horses are reared in the ranches
australia new- zealand argentina uruguay south-west africa western united states and central asia are major centers of commercial livestock rearing
agriculture agriculture is practised under multiple combinations of physical and socio- economic conditions which gives rise to different types of agriculture systems
based on methods of farming different type of crops are grown and livestock raised
the following are the main agricultural systems subsistence agriculture in this type of agriculture farmers consume all or nearly all of the produce as the size of the farm is very small
it can be divided into primitive subsistence agriculture and intensive subsistence agriculture
primitive subsistence agriculture this is widely practised in tropical areas of africasouth central america and south-east asia
different names are given to it in different places like milpa jhuming ladang
it is also called slash and bum agriculture or shifting agriculture
cultivation is done through primitive tools by clearing a patch of land
after  to  years when the soil loses its fertility then new land is cleared for cultivation
intensive subsistence agriculture this type of agriculture is practised in densely populated regions of monsoon asia
this type of cultivation is either dominated by wet paddy cultivation and crops other than paddy
the per unit area is high but productivity is low as land holdings are small due to high density of population less use of machines family labour involved and farm yard manures are used
in india it is practised in indo-gangetic plains dry parts of western and southern india
plantation agriculture this type of agriculture was introduced by the europeans like cocoa and coffee in west africa by french tea in india and sri lanka rubber in malaysia sugarcane and banana in west indies by british coconut sugarcane in philippines by spanish etc
here agriculture is done on large estates or plantations requires huge capital investment and scientific methods of cultivation
 crops like wheat corn barley oats and rye are grown
agriculture is mechanised as farms are very large
there is low yield per acre but high yield per person
mixed farming  this is practised in north-western europe eastern-north america parts of eurasia and temperate latitudes of southern continents
here crop cultivation along with animal husbandry is practised
crops like wheat barley oats rye maize fodder and root crops along with the rearing of farm animals like cattle sheep pig poultry is done to provide extra income
 there is crop rotation and inter cropping along with high capital expenditure on farm inputs
dairy farming  it is practised near urban and industrial centers of north-western europe canada south- eastern australia new zealand and tasmania
it is highly capital intensive due to cost of feeding milching machines animal sheds storage facilities veterinary services etc
 it is also labour intensive as rigorous care of i animals is also needed
there is no off seasonr during the year as in case of crop raising
mediterranean agriculture it is practised on either side of mediterranean in europe north africa from tunisia to atlantic coast southem-califomia some i parts of chile south-western parts of south africa and south-western parts of australia
it is highly specialised commercial agriculture and important supplier of citrus fruits
viticulture this refers to cultivation of grapes in the mediterranean regions
inferior grapes are made into raisins and currants while superior grapes are processed into wines
figs and olives are also cultivated
market gardening and horticulture  it is practised in highly developed and industrial regions of north-west europe north-east united states and mediterranean regions
netherlands specialises in cultivation of tulip flowers
 this type of cultivation refers to high value crops like vegetables fruits and flowers solely for urban markets
farms are small and mechanised
it is both capital and labour intensive
the distance between the farms and urban markets can be covered through trucks overnight hence its name is known as ‘truck farming
’ factory farming this refers to livestock rearing mainly poultry and cattle
this is capital intensive requires maintenance supervisation and scientific breeding
it is practised in industrial regions of europe and north america
co-operative farming under this farming group of farmers form a co-operative society by pooling their resources voluntarily for more efficient and profitable farming
there is help from societies in buying and selling farm products
it is practised in denmark netherlands belgium sweden and italy
collected farming  it is based on social ownership of the means of production and collective labour
here farmers pool their resources though they are allowed to keep a small part with themselves
 produce is sold to state at prefixed prices
members paid according to the nature of work done
it was practised first in kelkhoz in erstwhile soviet union
mining it refers to the extraction of mineral resources from the earth
its development began with the industrial revolution
factors affecting mining activity there are two factors that affect the mining activity
physical factors related to size grade and mode of occurrence of the deposits
economic factors related to demand for mineral technology capital to develop infrastructure labour and transport cost
methods of mining it is of two types i
surface of open cast mining occurs close to the surface it is easiest and cheapest
the other is underground mining in which minerals are extracted from very deep mines using vertical shafts
it requires lifts drills and very efficient technology
the developed economies are retreating from mining due to high labour cost while developing economies are becoming major exporters of minerals due to their large labour force and striving for better standard of living
manufacturing industries these are geographically located manufacturing units that transform raw materials into finished goods of higher value for sale in local or distant markets
the term industry is comprehensive and can also be used in many secondary activities which are not carried on in factories like entertainment industry tourism industry etc
the manufacturing industries are characterised by the following  specialisation of skills in industries one task is done repeatedly that gives specialisation of doing that task
this involves high cost of manufacturing
on the other hand mass production involves production of large quantity of standardised parts by each worker performing only one task repeatedly
 mechanisation the industries use automated processes or machines which does the major production
human thinking is not required in mechanisation
 technological innovation latest technology is used and constant innovation is done to eliminate waste quality control combat pollution and bring efficiency
 uneven geographic distribution the industries are concentrated in regions that are rich in mineral and other resources
these areas cover less than % of the world’s land area
these regions have become the major centres of economic and political power
location of industry the location of industry at a particular place is governed by a large number of geographical and non- geographical factors
industries maximise profits by reducing costs
thus industries should be located at points where the production costs are minimum
following factors influence the location of industry at particular places  access to market areas that provide large markets for finished industrial goods like developed areas of europe america japan australia south asia have huge concentration of industries
industries using more power are located close to these sources
 access to raw material industries based on cheap bulky and weight-losing materials ores like steel sugar are based close to sources of raw materials
similarly processing of dairy products perishable foods and agro based are done near the sources of raw materials
 access to labour supply industries are located where there is availability of skilled labour
some types of manufacturing still require skilled labour
 acccess to source of energy industries which use more power are located nearer to the source of energy supply such as iron and steel industries
energy is most essential to run machines in industries
the main power resources are coal petroleum hydroelectricity natural gas and nuclear energy
 access to transportation and communication facilities industries are located in places that have efficient transportation facilities and communication services for the exchange and management of information
 access to agglomeration economies agglomeration economies refer to the benefits derived from the linkages that exist between different industries
the small industries or ancillary units like to operate near leader industries to benefit from nearness to big or basic industries
 government policy for the balanced economic development governments promote various regions by setting up industries in a particular link between industrial areas
classification of manufacturing industries industries are classified on the basis of their size inputs raw materials output products and ownership
industries based on size based on amount of capital invested a number of workers employed and volume of production industries are classified into the following household industries or cottage manufacturing it is the smallest manufacturing unit
artisans use local raw materials simple tools and production is done with the help of family members
production is done for local consumption and local markets
there is not much capital needed e
mats baskets pottery jewellery artefacts and crafts
small scale manufacturing these type of industries employ semi-skilled labour operate by power driven machines use local raw materials and manufacture products in workshops
it provides employment and raises local purchasing power
india china indonesia and brazil have developed labour intensive small scale manufacturing units
large scale manufacturing industries are divided into two parts i
traditional large scale industrial regions and higlr technology large scale industrial regions
industries based on inputsraw materials on the basis of raw materials used industries are classified as follow  agro based industry this involves processing of raw materials from the fields and farms into finished products like sugar fruit juices beverages oils and textiles cotton jute silk rubber etc
 food processing this is part of agro based industry and includes processes like canning producing cream fruit processing confectionery drying fermenting and pickling
 agri business this is commercial farming on an industrial scale
the farms are mechanised very large and highly structured like tea plantation and tea factories near the plantations
 mineral based industry these are industries that use minerals as raw materials such as ferrous like iron and steel and non-ferrous like aluminium copper etc
mineral based non- metallic industries are of cement and pottery
 chemical based industry these industries use natural chemical minerals like salts sulphur potash mineral oil in petrochemical industry and chemicals obtained from wood and coal
synthetic fiber and plastics are other examples of chemical based industry
 forest based industry industries that use forest products such as timber wood bamboo grass lac etc come under forest based industry
 animal based industry industries that use animal products such as leather woollen textiles ivory are grouped under animal based industry
industries based on output product this refers to industries based on the finished products or output
basic industries these are the industries that produce raw material to be used in other industries such as iron and steel
consumer goods industries these are the industries which produces what is consumed by consumers directly such as tea biscuits toiletries etc
in india it is called public sector undertakings
socialist economies have all state owned industries
 private sector industry this refers to industries that are owned by private individuals and also managed by them
capitalist economies have mostly private owned industries
 joint sector industry industries that are jointly owned and managed by joint stock companies or established by private and government sector are called joint sector industries
foot loose industries these industries do not depend on any specific raw material so they can be located at any place
they largely depend on component parts employ small labour force and produce in small quantity
traditional large scale industrial regions traditional large scale industries are mostly heavy industries located near coal fields and involved in metal smelting heavy engineering chemical manufacturing or textile production
their features are high employment high density of housing but poor services unattractive environment pollution and waste heaps
due to these problems many industries are closed leading to unemployment emigration and wastelands
the ruhr coal field germany  this area was a major industrial region due to coal and iron-ore deposits
but the industry started shrinking as demand of coal declined iron-ore exhausted industrial waste and pollution increased
 now a new ruhr landscape has emerged that focusses on other products like opel car assembly plant new chemical plants universities and out of town shopping centres
high technology industry  also called high-tech industry it is highly technical and incorporates advanced scientific and engineering research and development strategy
 the workforce are highly skilled specialists professionals known as white collar who outnumber the production labour blue collar
 robotics computer aided design and manufacturing electronics new chemicals and pharmaceuticals are examples of these industries
it is also called heavy industry due to its bulky raw material and heavy finished products
 these industries are located near the source of raw materials i
iron ore coal manganese and limestone or near ports where it could be early brought
distribution this industry is spread in developed and developing countries such as america uk germany france belgium ukraine japan china and india jamshedpur durgapur raurkela etc
 cotton textile industry this industry has three sub-sectors 
handloom this is labour intensive employs semi-skilled workers requires small capital and involves processes like spinning weaving and finishing of the fabrics
powerloom this is less labour intensive uses of machines and production is more
mill sector this is highly capital intensive requires good quality raw cotton and produces in bulk
india china usa pakistan uzbekistan and egypt produce more than half of world’s raw cotton
now the cotton textile industry is shifting to less developed countries due to labour cost
they are trade transport communication and services
these include provision of services in exchange of payments
the collection and distribution points where trading takes place are called trading centres
these centres are divided into  rural marketing centres they are quasi urban and cater to local needs and areas
most of these have mandis wholesale markets and retail markets
in rural areas there are periodic markets that may be weekly or bi-weekly and people from the nearby areas meet their demands
these markets are held on specified dates and shopkeepers move from one place to another
 urban marketing centres these markets sell ordinary as well as specialised goods and services e
markets for labour housing semi or finished products
services of educational institutions and professionals like teachers doctors lawyers also develop
 retail trading in this type of trading goods are directly sold to consumers
this trading is done through fixed establishments or stores small shops consumer cooperatives big departmental stores and chain stores
the chain stores buy commodities in bulk and then hire skilled specialists for executive tasks
street peddling handcarts trucks door-to-door mail order telephone and internet are examples of non-store retail trading
 wholesale trading here bulk buying takes place directly from the manufacturer by numerous intermediary merchants
the merchants wholesalers extend credit to retailers
transport transport is a tertiary activity in which people materials and manufactured goods are physically carried from one place to another
while selecting the mode of transport distance time and cost are seen
distance can be measured as km distance time taken to travel particular route as time distance expense of travelling on a route as cost distance
factors affecting transport demand and routes are two major factors which affect transport services
 demand transport depends on the size of population and standard of living of people
the larger the population size the greater is the demand for transport
 route it refers to the transport network depend on location of cities towns villages industrial centres availability of raw materials nature of landscape type of climate availability of funds etc
network a network is a well developed transport system that is made up of nodes and links
a node is a meeting point of two or more routes and every road that joins any two nodes is called a link
the development of transport facilitated communication as messages were carried by hand animals boat road rail and air
but new technology has made communication independent of transport such as mobiles telephony and satellites
some of the communication services are discussed below  telecommunications the development of modem technology has revolutionised communication and it has become direct and instantaneous e
telegraph morse code and telex in last century and now satellites mobile telephony etc are used
 mass media communication means through which messages could be sent to vast audiences around the world are called mass media e
the internet has revolutionised the global communication
services there are different levels at which services are provided and availed
some are meant for industry some for people and some for both industry and people i
services can be divided into three sub-categories
they are  low order services it includes common and widespread services like grocery shops laundries etc
 domestic services it includes housekeepers cooks and gardeners which migrate from rural areas in search of employment
 high order services these are specialised and less common like accountants consultants and physicians
some services are supervised andor regulated by government like making maintaining highways bridges fire fighting departments education healthcare etc
people engaged in tertiary activities earlier more number of people were employed in t he primary and secondary sector as these sectors provided more jobs
but now there has been a shift of jobs to tertiary or service sector
in developed countries a higher percentage of workers are employed in providing services as compared to less developed countries
this industry generates jobs as people are engaged in providing accommodation meals transport entertairment infrastructure retail trading and crafts
tourist regions  tourism can be seasonal or throughout the year like warmer places around the mediterranean coast west coast of india during winters mountains in summers or winter spots regions found mainly in mountainous areas
 historic towns religious places heritage sites offer tourism throughout the year
factors affecting tourism  the rise in tourism industry is due to increased demand for it which is thus influenced by improvement in standard of living and increased leisure time
 another factor is improvement in transportation that has made travel easier and destinations reachable
tourist attractions tourist attractions are specific features of a place that attract people
these are as follows  climate in winter holidays areas having warm sunny weather is preferred like beaches in southern europe so it attracts more number of tourists there
 landscape mountains lakes spectacular sea coasts and landscapes not completely altered by man are good tourist attractions
 history and art ancient or picturesque towns archaeological sites historically important places having castles and palaces attract tourists
 culture and economy areas having rich cultures attract people as they go their to experience ethnic and local customs
medical services for overseas patients in india medical services or tourism takes place when medical treatment is combined with international tourism activity
people from developed countries like us are visiting india for medical tourism or services
this brings economic benefits to india and other countries where medical tourism is taking place like thailand singapore and malaysia
other medical related activities such as outsourcing of medical tests data interpretation reading radiology images interpreting magnetic resonance images mris and ultrasound tests are taking place in india australia and switzerland
they centre around research development and may involve specialised knowledge and technical skills
software developers mutual fund managers doctors accounting brokerage firms are some examples of quaternary activities
they can be outsourced even as these are not tied to resources or affected by the environment or markets
this sector has replaced primary and secondary sector and absorbs half of the population in developed economies
quinary activities the activities that are highly specific and specialised are placed under it
these include high level decision-makers administrators government officials research scientists etc
they are also known as gold collar professions
outsourcing  it means contracting out or giving work to an outside agency to improve efficiency and to reduce cost
it is termed as off-shoring when work is transferred to overseas location
 outsourcing provides employment in developing countries of india china botswana etc
information technology human resources customer support call centres data processing and other it related services are examples of outsourcing
bpo  bpo stands for business process outsourcing which involves customer support services call centres and similar other processes
 the developed countries transfer these jobs as overhead costs are much lower making it profitable to get job work carried out
kpo kpo stands for a knowledge process outsourcing which involves skilled workers and enables companies to create additional business opportunities e
the digital divide  development emerging from the information and communication technology is unevenly spread across the globe
some regions have prospered while others are lagged behind
this is known as digital divide
 in developing countries this kind of divide is seen more than developed countries
here the metropolitan cities are developed more than rural areas
modes of transportation  the main modes of transportation are land water air and pipelines
these are used for inter-regional and intra-regional transport and each one except pipelines carries both passengers and goods
 several places nodes join together by a series of routes links to form a pattern is called transport network
land transport this includes movement of goods and services over land i
earlier humans themselves were carriers such as in palanquin palki or doli later pack animals such as mules horses camels were used
dogs and reindeers were used in north america
in india bullocks were used to pull carts
the revolution came after invention of steam engine in th century that started railways and roadways with the invention of internal combustion engines
among the new means of land transport are pipelines ropeways and cableways
rope and cableways are generally found on steep mountain slopes and mines which are not suitable for building roads
roads it is most economical for short distance and gaining importance for freight transport due to its door to door service
metalled roads are all weather roads while unmetalled roads are not serviceable in all seasons due to their simple construction
though heavy rains and floods make both the roads unserviceable
the quality construction and maintenance of roads is better in developed countries than in developing countries as it requires heavy expenditure
road density  the total motorable road length of the world is only about  million km in which north america separately accounted %
although north america in compare to western europe registered highest number of vehicles as well as highest road density
 road density is the total length of roads per hundred square kilometre of area
as the road network cannot cope with the demands of traffic so congestion occurs
highways  they are metalled roads connecting distant places for unobstructed vehicular movement
these are m wide with separate traffic lanes bridges flyovers and dual carriageways  in north america there is dense network of highways
pacific coast is linked to atlantic coast vancouver is connected to newfoundland by trans-canadian highway and edmonton is connected to anchorage through alaskan highway
 trans-continental stuart highway connects darwin melbourne to alice springs in australia
europe has well developed highway network
moscow-vladivostok highway is important for russia
highways criss-cross the country in china
 in india national highway no
 nh connecting varanasi and kanyakumari is the longest highway of the country
the golden quadrilateral or super expressway is under construction
now nh- became the longest running highway in india
it connects srinagar to kanyakumari
nh- is renamed as national highway 
in africa algiers in north is connected to guinea and cairo connected to capetown in south
border roads these are roads laid along international boundaries
these roads help in transport of goods to border areas and military camps
railways railways are best suited for the transportation of bulky goods and passengers over long distances
highly industrialised areas urbanised regions and mineral rich areas are linked to railways for the transportation of ores grains timber and machinery
all the continents have dense network while europe is having the highest density of railways
trans-continental railways the railway line that runs across the continent and links its two ends is called a trans-continental railway line
they are constructed for economic and political reasons
the following are the most important of these trans-siberian railway it is in russia and the longest railway in the world
petersburg in west to vladivostok in east passing through moscow irkutsk chita etc
it links important agro centre with fur centre connecting rail routes to important cities of asia
trans-canadian railway constructed in  it is  km long railway in canada that links halifax in east to vancouver in west
it passes through the industrial region connecting the wheat belt of prairies and the coniferous forest area so it is considered economic artery of canada
wheat and meat are the important exports on this route
the union and pacific railway this rail line connects new york on the atlantic coast to san francisco on the pacific coast passing through cleveland chicago omaha evans ogden and sacramento
the most valuable exports on this route are ores grain paper chemicals and machinery
the australian trans-continental railway this rail line runs west-east across the southern part of the continent from perth on the west coast to sydney on the east coast passing through kalgoorlie broken hill and port augusta
another north- south line connects adelaide and alice spring and to be joined later to the darwin-birdum link
the orient express this line runs from paris to istanbul passing through strasbourg munich vienna budapest and belgrade
it has reduced the -day journey to only  days
cheese wine bacon oats fruits and machinery are chief exports on this rail route
water transport this is the cheapest mode of transport as no construction cost is there and very little maintenance cost
the linking of oceans have brought greater navigation with ships of various sizes
water transport is divided into sea routes and inland waterways
sea routes sea and oceans provide smooth highway traversable in all directions with no maintenance costs
modem passenger ships and cargo ships are equipped with various navigation aids
it is the busiest in the world and also called big trunk route
 mediterranean-indian ocean sea route this route connects industrialised western europe with west africa south africa south-east asia australia and new zealand
natural resources such as gold diamond copper tin groundnut oil palm coffee and fruits are transported through it
 cape of good hope sea route this route links west europe and west african countries with brazil argentina and uruguay in south america
traffic is less on this route because the countries falling in this route have similar products and resources
 the north pacific sea route this route connects the ports on the west coast of north america with those of asia
these are vancouver seattle portland san francisco and los angeles of american side with yokohama kobe shanghai hong kong manila and singapore of asian side
 the south pacific sea route this route is used for reaching hong kong philippines and indonesia and also links western europe and north america with australia new zealand and pacific islands via the panama canal
panama is  km far from sydney
honolulu is an important port on this route
 coastal shipping coastal shipping is a convenient mode of transportation with long coastlines e
this type of shipping can reduce congestion on land routes
shipping canals there are two canals that serve as gateways of commerce for both the eastern and western worlds
they are  the suez canal constructed in  it is a man-made canal linking the mediterranean sea and the red sea
it is  km long and  - m deep without any locks and sea water flows freely through it
 the panama canal it is a man-made canal linking atlantic ocean with pacific ocean
it is  km long and involves a deep cutting for a length of  km and has  locks
it shortens the distance between new york and san francisco by  km by sea
inland waterways rivers canals lakes and coastal areas are inland waterways for the transportation of cargo and passengers
the development of inland waterways depends on navigability water flow and transport technology
the important inland waterways are the  rhine waterways this waterway links the industrial areas of switzerland germany france belgium and the netherlands with the north atlantic sea routes
it flows through a rich coal field dusseldorf is an important port in this region
this waterway is the world’s most heavily used
more than  ocean-going ships and  inland vessels move from this waterways every year
 the danube waterway the danube river which is navigable upto tauma severin emerges in the black forest
it is used mainly for the export of wheat maize timber and machinery
 the volga waterway volga is one of the developed waterways of russia
it is navigable upto  km and drains into the caspian sea
it is connected to moscow region and the black sea through volga-moscow canal and volga- don canal respectively
 the great lakes-st lawrence seaway the great lakes alongwith estury of st lawrence river form a waterway in north america
duluth and buffalo are two important ports on this route
 the mississippi waterways the mississippi-ohio waterway links the interior part of usa with the gulf of mexico in the south
large steamers can move upto minneapolis
air transport it is the fastest means of transport but it is very costly
air transport has brought connectivity revolution in inhospitable deserts mountainous regions and snow fields where other means of transport are not reachable
due to high construction and maintenance cost air transport is more developed in highly industrialised countries
supersonic aircrafts cover the distance in very short time
inter- continental air routes usa accounts for % of airways of the world
important cities are nodal points where air routes converge or radiate to all continents
africa asiatic part of russia and south america lack air services sparser population or limited landmass or low economic development
pipelines these are used to transport water petroleum natural gas liquidified coal for an uninterrupted flow
milk is supplied through pipelines in new zealand
usa has dense network of pipelines
big inch is famous pipeline of usa that transports petroleum from the oil wells of the gulf of mexico to the north-eastern states
in europe russia west asia and india oil wells are linked to refineries through pipelines
communications long distance communication in the form of telegraph and telephone are important
in mid-th century american telegraph and telephone company at&t enjoyed monopoly
in developing countries the use of cell phones has gained importance for rural connectivity
latest technology developments have resulted in optical fibre cables ofc
now the telecommunication merged with computers to form integrated networks termed as internet
satellite communication in india artificial satellites are deployed in earth’s orbit to enhance communication and improve connectivity
this is satellite communication which has reduced the per unit cost and time of communication also
india developed its own satellite aryabhatta and launched it on th april  bhaskar -i in  and rohini in 
bhaskar challenger and insat-ib satellites are used for long distance communication and weather forecasting
cyber space-internet this is the latest technology in which there is instant connectivity by accessing the electronic computerised space
majority of internet users are in usa uk germany japan china and india
the social and economic space has expanded through e-mail e-commerce e-leaming and e-governance
slowly long distance trade developed of which silk route is an example
the route was  km long connecting rome to china and traders transported chinese silk roman wool metals etc through this route
later sea and ocean routes were discovered and trade grew
 the slave trade emerged in th century in which the portuguese dutch spaniards and british captured african natives and sold to plantation owners in america
after industrial revolution industrialised nations imported raw materials and exported finished products to non-industrial nations
 international trade is the result of specialisation in production and division of labour
it is based on the principle of comparative advantage that is mutually beneficial to trading partners
basis of international trade the factors on which international trade depends are as follows  difference in national resources the resources are unevenly distributed in the world
these differences mainly refer to geology mineral resources and climate
 mineral resources the regions rich in minerals will support industrial development that leads to trade
 climate it influences the type of flora and fauna that is found in a region such as wool production in cold regions
cocoa rubber bananas can grow in tropical regions
 population factors the size distribution and diversity of population between countries affect the trade in respect of type and volume of goods
large volume of internal trade than external trade takes place in densely populated areas due to consumption in local markets
 cultural factors distinctive forms of art and craft develop in certain cultures and give rise to trade e
porcelain and brocades of china carpets of iran batik cloth of indonesia etc
 stage of economic development industrialised nations export machinery finished products and import foodgrains and raw materials
the situation is opposite in agriculturally important countries
 extent of foreign investment developing countries lack capital so foreign investment can boost trade in developing countries by developing plantation agriculture
 transport lack of transport in older time restricted trade only to local areas
the expansion of rail ocean and air transport better means of refrigeration and preservation trade has experienced spatial expansion***’ aspects of international trade there are three very important aspects of international trade  volume of trade it is measured simply as the total value of goods and services traded
however actual tonnage of traded goods makes up the volume but services traded cannot be measured in tonnage
 composition of trade earlier primary’ goods were more in total traded goods then there was dominance of manufactured goods and now there is dominance of service sector which includes transportation and other commercial services
 direction of trade earlier valuable goods and artefacts were exported to european countries by the developing countries
later in the th century manufactured goods from european countries were exchanged with foodstuffs and with raw materials from their colonies
 multilateral trade it is conducted with many trading countries at the same time at goods which the countries are specialised in
the country may also grant the status of most favoured nation mnf on some of trading partners
balance of trade  it refers to the volume of goods and services imported and exported by one country to other countries
favourable balance of trade means the value of exports is more than its imports
 unfavourable balance of trade means that imports are more than exports
balance of payments affects a country’s economy as negative balance means country’s expenses are more than its income
case for free trade  free trade or trade liberalisation is the act of opening up of economics so that more trade takes place
this is done by bringing down trade barriers like tarrifs
but trade liberalisation causes competition and can cause dumping
 dumping is the selling of a commodity in two countries at a price that differs for reasons not related to costs
countries need to be cautious about dumped goods
 the wto sets the rules for the global trading system
the headquarters of wto is located in geneva switzerland and  countries are its members
 however wto has been criticised and opposed by those who are worried about the effects of free trade and economic globalisation
they argued that free trade is not beneficial to the ordinary people as it is widening the gap between rich and poor
 they also argued that issues of health workers’ rights child labour and environment are ignored
some of the trade blocs are as follows concerns related to international trade this can be summarised as merits and demerits of international trade
 merits of international trade international trade is beneficial if it promotes regional specialisation higher level of production better standard of living worldwide availability of goods and sendees equalisation of price and wages and diffusion of knowledge and culture
 demerits of international trade the demerits are it leads to dependence on other countries uneven levels of development exploitation and commercial rivalry
gateways of international trade harbours and ports are the chief gateways of international trade
these ports facilitate the passage of cargos and travellers as well as provide facilities of docking loading unloading and storage
types of ports on the basis of cargo handled are  industrial ports the ports that handle bulk cargo like grain ores oil chemicals are called industrial ports
 commercial ports ports handling packaged products manufactured goods passengers are commercial ports
 comprehensive ports ports that handle bulk and general cargo in large volumes are called comprehensive ports
most of the world’s great ports are classified as comprehensive ports
types of ports on the basis of location  inland ports ports located away from the sea coasts and linked to the sea through a river or a canal are inland ports e
 out ports ports in deep waters built away from the actual ports and serving big ships are called out ports e
athens and its out port piraeus in greece
types of ports on the basis of specialised functions  oil ports ports that deal in the processing and shipping of oil are known as oil ports
these are tanker ports like tripoli in lebanon and refinery’ ports like abadon on the gulf of persia
 ports of call ports which originally developed as calling points on main sea routes where ships used to anchor for refuelling watering and taking food items are called ports of call e
 packet station also known as ferry ports these are exclusively concerned with the transportation of passengers and mail across water bodies covering short distances e
 dover in england and calais in france
 entrepot ports these are collection centres where the goods are brought from different countries for export e
 singapore is an entrepot for asia
 naval ports these ports serve worships and have repair workshops for them e
 kochi karwar in india
there is no uniformity in the differentiation of the settlements
but the basic difference between towns and villages is that in towns the main occupation of the people is related to secondary and tertiary sectors on the other side in villages people are engaged in primary activities
 sub-urbanisation it is a new trend of people moving away from congested urban areas to cleaner areas outside the city in search of better quality of life
 census of india  it defines urban settlements as places which have municipal corporation cantonment board notified town area committee and have a population of  persons and above and where % of male workers are engaged in non-agricultural activities and density of population is at least  persons per sq km
types and patterns of settlements settlements can be classified into compact and dispersed by their shape pattern and types
the major types classified by shape are as follows  compact or nucleated settlements in these settlements large number of houses are built very close to each other and they develop along the river valleys and in fertile plains
there are close knit communities and people here share common occupations
 dispersed settlements in these settlements houses are spaced far apart and often interspersed with fields such as a place of worship a market that binds the settlement together
rural settlements these settlements are closely and directly related to land
they are dominated by primary activities like agriculture fishing animal husbandry etc
the factors affecting the location of settlements are as follows  water supply rural settlements are located near water bodies such as rivers lakes and springs as water is needed for irrigation fishing navigation and drinking
 land fertile lands suitable for agriculture are places of human settlement like villages in rolling countryside in europe avoiding swampy areas low lying river valleys and coastal plains suited for wet rice cultivation in south-east asia
 upland dry points like uplands terraces leaves that are not prone to flooding are places of settlements
in tropical countries people build their houses on stilts near marshy lands to protect themselves from flood insects and animal pests
 defence places that form good defensive site are developed as settlements like defensive hills islands etc
in india forts were built on hills
 planned settlements planned settlements are constructed by government by providing shelter water and other infrastructure on acquired lands e
canal colonies in indira gandhi canal command area in india
rural settlement patterns this refers to the way the houses are sited in relation to each other
the surrounding topography terrain influence the shape
they are classified as below 
on the basis of setting the main types are plain and size of village plain villages plateau villages coastal villages forest villages desert villages etc
on the basis of functions there may be farming villages fishermen villages lumbeijack villages pastoral villages etc
on the basis of formsshapes of the settlement the villages are developed in geometrical forms and shapes such as linear pattern the houses are located along the road railway line river canal edge of a valley along a levee
rectangular pattern the settlements are located in plain areas or in wide inter montane valleys
the roads are rectangular and cut each other at right angles
circular pattern the settlements develop around lakes tanks and the central part remains open for keeping the animals to protect them from wild animals
star-like pattern these settlements develop where several roads converge and the houses are built along the roads
t-shaped y-shaped cross-shaped or cruciform settlements the t-shape settlements develop at tri-junctions y-shaped settlements emerge where two roads converge on the third and houses are built along these roads cruciform settlements develop on the cross-roads and houses extend in all the four directions
double village these settlements extend on both sides of a river where there is a bridge or a ferry
problems of rural settlements  rural settlements in developing countries are large in number and have poor infrastructure
there is inadequate supply of water in these settlements
there is lack of irrigation facilities problem of drought and flood in rural settlements
inadequate sanitation facility toilet and garbage disposal facilities cause health related problems
 proper housing and separate shed for animals are not there
rural settlements mostly lack metalled roads and modern communication network
health centres and educational institutions are less in number
urban settlements there had been a rapid growth of urban settlements around the world
the first city to reach a population of one million was london in ad 
at present % of the world population live in cities
classification of urban settlements common basis of classification are  population size it refers to the lower limit of the population for a settlement to be designated as urban
it is not universal and varies from country to country
in columbia a settlement having population of  is termed as urban in argentina and portugal it is   in usa and thailand  in india  in japan  in denmark sweden and finland  in iceland and  in canada and venezuela
 occupational structure in some countries the major economic activities alongwith population size designate a settlement as urban
in italy settlement called as urban if more than % of its economically productive population is engaged in non-agricultural pursuits
india has set its criterion at %
 administration administration set up also designates a settlement as urban in some countries
in india if an area has a municipality notified area council then it is considered urban
 location location of urban centres is examined with reference to their function e
strategic towns offering natural defence mining towns industrial towns tourist centres places with historical relics and other places that can provide proper living conditions have the potential to develop into urban centres
functions of urban centres on the basis of the functions the urban settlements are classified into the following  administrative towns national capitals having administrative offices like new delhi canberra london beijing etc are called administrative towns
provincial sub-national towns can also have administrative functions e
victoria british columbia albany new york etc
 cultural towns pilgrimage places like jerusalem varanasi jagannath puri etc are considered cultural towns
other centres like health and recereation miami industrial pittsburgh and jamshedpur mining quarrying dhanbad and transport singapore and mughal sarai are also urban settlements
classification of towns on the basis of forms urban settlements can be linear square star or crescent shaped
cities in developed countries are planned while in developing countries have evolved historically with irregular shapes
chandigarh and canberra are planned cities while smaller town in india have evolved historically from walled cities to large urban sprawls
 addis ababa established in  it is capital of ethiopia and is located in hill valley topography
it is a large nodal centre has large markets and government headquarters
the city has witnessed rapid growth and expansion in all directions
 canberra established in  it is the capital of australia
it is a garden city with wide open spaces parks and gardens
initially it was built to accommodate  people but now it has expanded to accommodate many satellite towns
types of urban settlements problems of urban settlements depending upon the size and services available urban centres are classified further as follows  towns these can be well understood with reference to ‘village’
specific functions such as manufacturing retail and wholesale trade and professional services exist in towns
 city they are larger than towns have greater number of economic functions tend to have transport terminals major financial institution and administrative offices
in the words of lewis mumford ”the city is in fact the physical form of the highest and most complex type of associative life”
 conurbation the term conurbation was coined by patrick geddes in 
this is applied to a large area of urban development that resulted from the merging of originally separate towns or cities like greater london and tokyo
 megalopolis popularised by jean gottman  this signifies super metropolitan region extending as union of conurbations e
urban landscape stretching from boston to washington
london reached million mark in  followed by paris in  and by  there were around  such cities
 distribution of mega cities the number of mega cities or megalopolis has been rising rapidly
the number of mega cities is  currently
at present the number of million cities in europe is   in asia  in north and central america  in south america  in africa and  in australia
they are also inadequate in infrastructure such as electricity sewage disposal health and education facilities
problems of urban settelments in developing countries urban settlements suffer from unsustainable concentration of population congested housing lack of drinking water poor infrastructure no proper sewage disposal health and education facilities vertical expansion and growth of slums
most of the cities in developing countries suffer from such unplanned growth
they are  economic problems the decreasing employment opportunities in rural areas push the unskilled and semi-skilled labour force to migrate to urban areas which is already saturated
‘  socio-cultaral problems cities in developing countries suffer from several social ills
lack of financial resources fail to create adequate social infrastructure
lack of employment and education tends to aggravate the crime rates
male selective migration to the urban areas disorts the sex ratio in these cities
 environmental problems urban settlements in developing countries suffer from improper sewage system massive use of fuel that causes air pollution lack of clean drinking water dumping of untreated wastes and huge concrete structures that aggravate the environmental problems
urban strategy the united nations development programme undp outlines the urban strategy that aims to increase shelter for urban poor provision of basic services like primary healthcare drinking water education sanitation government facilities upgrading energy use alternative transport system and reducing air pollution
it should be technologically accessible economically feasible and culturally acceptable
only then it can be termed as a ‘resource’
examples minerals forests fossil fuels etc
classification of resources a on the basis of origin biotic and abiotic
b on the basis of exhaustibility renewable and non-renewable
c on the basis of ownership individual personal community national and international
d on the basis of status and development potential developed reserve and stock
 biotic resources are obtained from the biosphere
they have life or are living resources e
 human beings fisheries forests etc
 abiotic resources include all non-living things e
renewable resources the resources which can be renewed or reproduced by physical chemical and mechanical processes are known as renewable or replenishable resources e
 water wildlife forests solar energy wind energy etc
non-renewable resources the resources which once get exhausted cannot be remade
they take a long geological period of time i
 millions of years in their formation e
 minerals fossil’ fuels etc
individual resources owned by individuals e
 own land house 
community owned resources resources which are accessible to all the members of the community e
national resources resources which belong to the nation e
 roads railways and 
international resources resources which no individual country can utilize e
 oceanic waters beyond  km
potential resources resources found in a region but not in use e
 solar energy in rajasthan wind in gujarat 
stock resources available but do not have appropriate technology to access e
 lack of technical know how to use hydrogen and oxygen as source of energy and 
can be used for future needs e
 water in the dams forest resources
sustainable development sustainable economic development means that ‘development should take place without damaging the environment and development in the present should not compromise with the needs of future generation’
land under important relief features in india plains-% mountains-% plateaus-% land degradation continuous use of land over a long period of time without taking appropriate measures to conserve and manage it
measures to solve problem of land degradation afforestation proper management of grazing to control overgrazing planting of shelter belts of plants stabilization of sand dunes by growing thorny bushes control of mining activities avoid over-irrigation and overuse of fertilizers and pesticides soil erosion the denudation of the soil cover and subsequent washing down is soil erosion
reasons for soil erosion include— a human activities like deforestation over grazing construction mining defective method of fanning etc
 b natural forces like wind glacier and water flow
types of erosion a gully erosion
the running water cuts through the clayey soils and makes deep channels known as gullies
this makes the land bad land and in the chambal basin such land is known as ravines b sheet erosion
when top soil over large area is washed away it is known as sheet erosion
soils and its types  alluvial soils entire northern plains are made of alluvial soil
also found in the eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the mahanadi the godavari the krishna and the kaveri rivers
fertile soil therefore fit for agriculture purpose
regions of alluvial soils are intensively cultivated and densely populated
rich in potash phosphoric acid and lime which are ideal for the growth of sugarcane paddy wheat and other cereal and pulse crops
 black soil black in colour and are also known as regur soils
ideal for growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil
found in the plateaus of maharashtra saurashtra malwa madhya pradesh and chhattisgarh also along the godavari and the krishna valleys
made up of extremely fine i
well-known for their capacity to hold moisture
rich in calcium carbonate magnesium potash and lime
 red and yellow soils found in the areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the deccan plateau
also found in parts of odisha chhattisgarh southern parts of the middle ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the western ghats
develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks
 laterite soils develops in areas with high temperature and heavy rainfall
found in karnataka kerala tamil nadu madhya pradesh and the hilly areas of odisha and assam
suitable for cultivation with adequate doses of manures and fertilizers
low humus content because decomposers like bacteria get destroyed due to high temperature
 arid soils found in the western parts of rajasthan
after proper irrigation these soils become cultivable
lacks humus and moisture because dry climate high temperature make evaporation faster
salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by evaporating the water
 forest soils found in the hilly and mountainous areas where sufficient rain forests are available
feature differs based on location
loamy and silty in valley sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes
 per cent of the total volume of world’s water is estimated to exist as oceans and only 
 per cent exists as fresh water
 per cent of the fresh water occurs as ice sheets and glaciers in antarctica greenland and the mountainous regions of the world
less than  per cent is stored as groundwater in the world’s acquirers
fresh water is mainly obtained from surface run off and ground water
this is continually being renewed and recharged through the hydrological cycle
all the water moves within the hydrological cycle making water a renewable resource
three fresh water sources are precipitation—from rainfall surface water—in rivers lakes etc
 ground water—water stored in underground acquirers which gets recharged by rainfall
water scarcity water scarcity means shortage of water
it is usually associated with regions having low rainfall or drought prone areas
there are many other reasons which lead to scarcity of water large growing population in the agricultural sector water resources are being over-exploited to expand irrigated areas and dry- season agriculture more water required for irrigation purposes to facilitate higher food production i
 for doing multiple cropping and for hyv seeds there is greater demand for water with growing urbanization and industrialization an unequal access to water among different social groups the quality of water is deteriorating i
 getting polluted by domestic and industrial wastes chemical fertilizers and pesticides used in agriculture excessive use of water by industries which also require water to generate hydro-electric power to run them and over exploitation of water in the urban areas
adverse effects of over-exploitation of ground water resources  pumping out more water from under the ground may lead to falling ground water levels
 this in turn will affect our agriculture and food security of the people
 impoverishment of water resources may adversely affect the ecological cycle
main causes of water pollution domestic wastes especially urban sewers industrial wastes are disposed off in the water without proper treatment chemical effluents from industries and from agricultural sector and many human activities e
 religious rituals and immersing of idols etc
in the water also pollute water
measures for water conservation  do not overdraw the ground water recharge it by techniques like rainwater harvesting tapping rainwater in reservoirs watershed development programmes etc
 avoid wastage of water at all levels and do not pollute the water
 adopting water conserving techniques of irrigation e
 drip irrigation and sprinklers etc
 especially in dry areas
a dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs directs or retards the flow creating a reservoir lake or impoundment
a dam is the reservoir and not the whole structure
multipurpose river valley projects —’the temples of modem india’ jawahar lai nehru pro-claimed that multipurpose projects are ‘the temples of modem india’ because they were thought of as the vehicle that would lead the nation to development and progress
he believed that these projects with their integrated water resource management approach would integrate development of agriculture and the village economy with rapid industrialization and growth of the urban economy
disadavantages  damming of rivers affects their natural flow causing poor sediment flow  excessive sedimentation at the bottom of the reservoir  lack of sediments results in a rockier stream bed and b poorer habitat for the rivers aquatic life  the reservoirs submerge the existing vegetation and soil leading to its decomposition over time  they affect the fertility levels of the soil  cause large scale displacement of local communities
traditional rainwater harvesting methods practiced in different parts of the country  in mountainous areas ‘guls’ and ‘kuls’ the diversion channels were built for agriculture
 ‘rooftop rainwater harvesting’ was commonly practiced to store drinking water especially in rajasthan
 inundation channels for irrigation were developed in the flood plains of west bengal
 in arid and semi-arid regions agricultural fields were converted into rain fed storage structures e
 ‘khadins’ in jaisalmer and ‘johads’ in other parts of rajasthan
 in semi-arid and arid regions of rajasthan particularly in bikaner phalodi and banner all the houses had underground tanks or ‘tankas’ built inside the house for storing drinking water
they were a part of the well-developed rooftop rainwater harvesting system
‘narmada bachao andolan’ narmada bachao andolan or save narmada movement is an ngo that mobilized tribal people farmers environmentalists and human rights activists against the sardar sarovar dam being built across the narmada river in gujarat
the movement originally focused on environmental issues related to submerging of trees under the dam water
two-third of its population is engaged in agricultural activities
agriculture is a primary activity and produces most of the food and food grains
it produces raw materials for our various industries e
 cotton textile sugar industry
agricultural products like tea coffee spices are exported and earn foreign exchange
primitive subsistence farming this type of farming is practiced in few pockets of india on small patches of land using primitive tools and familycommunity labor
farmers clear a patch of land and produce cereals and other food crops to sustain their families
when the soil fertility decreases the farmers shift and clear a fresh patch of land for cultivation
this type of shifting allows nature to replenish the fertility of the soil through natural processes
land productivity is low as the farmer does not use fertilizers or other modem inputs
intensive subsistence farming it is practiced in areas of high population pressure on land
it is labor intensive farming
yield per hectare is high because high doses of biochemical inputs and irrigation are used
the size of the land-holdings is small and uneconomical
farmers take maximum output from the limited land by raising - crops in a year from the same land i
 multiple cropping is practiced
commercial agriculture in this crops are mainly grown for commercial purposes
it is practiced on large pieces of land on scientific and commercial lines using machines and modem technology
there is higher use of modem agricultural inputs e
 hyv seeds fertilizers irrigation etc
the degree of commercialization varies from one region to another
rice is a commercial crop in punjab while in odisha it is subsistence crop
plantation is carried out on large estates using lot of capital intensive units
lot of migrant laborers work on these estates
the plantation has an interface of agriculture and industry
all the produce is used as raw material in the respective industries
the production is mainly for the market i
rabi kharif and zaid are the three cropping seasons  rabi crops winter crops sown in winter—october to december
harvested in summer—april to june
important crops wheat barley mustard peas gram etc
 kharif crops crops of the rainy season sown—onset of monsoon june-july
important crops rice maize millets jowar bajra tur arhar moong urad cotton jute groundnut and soyabean
 zaid season it is a short cropping season during summer months mainly between march-april and june-july
main crops—watermelon musk melon cucumber etc
rice is the most important food crop kharif crop of india
india holds second position in rice production after china
cultivation—high temperature of ° c and above and high humidity with annual rainfall of  cms is required
four major regions of rice cultivation are — 
plains of north india 
plains of north-eastern india 
irrigated rice is produced in punjab haryana western up and rajasthan
wheat is the second most important cereal crop of india
it is the main food crop
geographical conditions cool and moist growing season
bright sunshine at the time of ripening
rainfall  to  cm evenly distributed over the growing season loamy soil
black soil region of the deccan
wheat producing states—punjab haryana up bihar rajasthan and madhya pradesh
jowar is the third most important food crop with respect to area and production kharif crop rainfed crop grown in moist areas
major producing states maharashtra karnataka andhra pradesh and madhya pradesh
millets are called coarse grains
they have high nutritional value important part of the diet for poor people
examples  ragi leading producer is karnataka followed by tamil nadu
himachal pradesh jharkhand uttaranchal sikkim etc
 jowar maharashtra is the leading producer followed by karnataka andhra pradesh madhya pradesh
 bajra it grows well on sandy soils and shallow black soils
rajasthan is the largest producer followed by uttar pradesh maharashtra gujarat and haryana
maize crop — geographical conditions kharif crop requires temperature between ° c to ° c requires moderate rainfall between - cm
it grows well in old alluvial soils
maize is a crop which is used both as food and fodder
in some states like bihar maize is grown in rabi season also

announcement of minimum support price remunerative and procurement prices for crops to check the exploitation of farmers
” they have physical and chemical properties by which they can be identified
some rocks consist of a single mineral e
 limestone while most rocks consist of several minerals
the term ‘ore’ is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements
minerals generally occur in the following forms 
in igneous and metamorphic rocks minerals may occur in the cracks faults or joints by getting solidified in them
the smaller occurrences are called veins and the larger lodes e
 metallic minerals like tin copper zinc and lead etc
are found in lodes and veins
in sedimentary rocks minerals occur in beds or layers
they are formed as a result of deposition accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata
some sedimentary minerals are formed as a result of evaporation especially in arid regions e
 gypsum potash and salt
another mode of formation involves decomposition of surface rocks and the removal of soluble contents leaving a residual mass of weathered material containing ores
bauxite is formed this way
certain minerals occur as alluvial deposits in sands of valley floors and the base of hills e
 gold silver tin and platinum
these are called placer deposits and contain minerals which are not corroded by water
ocean waters contain vast quantities of minerals e
 common salt magnesium and bromide are largely derived from the ocean waters
the ocean beds are rich in manganese nodules
four types of iron ores are magnetite hematite siderite and limonite
two best ores are  magnetite—it is the finest iron ore available with upto % iron content
it has excellent magnetic qualities and is especially valuable in the electrical industry
 hematite—it is the most important industrial iron ore in terms of quantity used
it has -% iron content
odisha-jharkhand belt badampahar mines—high grade hematite ore is found here
durg-bastar-chandrapur belt bailadila mines—super high grade hematite ore deposits are found in bailadila range
iron ore from these mines is exported to japan and south korea
bellary-chitradurga-chikmaglur tumkur belt in karnataka kudremukh mines — a  per cent export unit
the ore is transported as slurry to a port near mangalore
maharashtra-goa belt ratnagiri district of maharashtra—ores are not of very high quality
iron ore is exported through marmagao port
aluminium is obtained from bauxite ore
it is an important metal because—it has the strength of metals such as iron and is extremely light at the same time it has good conductivity and it has great malleability
bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates
leading state of bauxite production is odisha producing % of the total bauxite of india
the most important bauxite deposits are found in panchpatmali in koraput district
other states are gujarat % jharkhand % and maharashtra %
mica is made up of a series of plates or leaves
it splits easily into such thin sheets that a thousand put together are only a few centimeters thick
mica is indispensable for electric and electronic industry because it has —  excellent di-electric strength  low power loss factor  insulating properties and  resistance to high voltage
mica deposits are found in the northern edge of chhota nagpur plateau
jharkhand is the leading producer
the important mica producing belt here is koderma-gaya-hazaribagh
dangers involved in mining are— 
the risk of collapsing mine roofs 
fires in coal-mines is a constant threat to miners and 
poisonous gases dust and noxious fumes inhaled by miners make them vulnerable to pulmonary diseases
adverse effects of mining on the environment 
the water sources in the region get contaminated 
dumping of the slurry and waste leads to degradation of land and soil and 
it also leads to an increase in stream and river pollution
conservation of minerals is necessary because 
the formation of minerals takes a long geological period of millions of years
they are finite in nature non-renewable and exhaustible
the rate of replenishment of minerals is infinitely small in comparison to rate of consumption
they have to be preserved for our future generations
methods of mineral conservation 
we should use minerals in a planned and sustainable manner
improved technologies need to be evolved to allow use of low grade ores at low cost
recycling of metals using scrap metals and other substitutes
wastage’s in mining processing and distribution should be minimized
energy resources can be classified as conventional and non-conventional sources
conventional sources include coal petroleum natural gas and electricity both hydel and thermal
all these sources have been in use for quite some time
non-conventional sources of energy are relatively new sources as their large scale generation has started recently
these include solar wind tidal geothermal biogas and atomic energy
it provides a substantial part of the nation’s energy needs as it is abundantly available
it is used for power generation to supply energy for industrial and domestic needs
india is highly dependent on coal for meeting its commercial needs
it can easily be converted into other forms of energy—electricity gas oil etc
coal as an industrial raw material 
it is an indispensable raw material for iron and steel industry
it provides raw material for chemical industries and synthetic textile industries
many coal-based products are processed in industries e
 coal tar graphite soft coke etc
power generation industry is mainly based on this fossil fuel
four types of coal and their characteristics a anthracite—
it is the highest quality hard coal 
it contains more than % carbon content
it is the most popular coal in commercial use and has - % carbon content 
metallurgical coal is high grade bituminous coal and is of special value for smelting iron in blast furnaces
it is a low grade brown coal 
it is soft with high moisture content
the main lignite reserve is neyveli in tamil nadu
it has a low carbon and high moisture content 
it has low heating capacity and gives lot of smoke on burning
occurrence of coal  gondwana coal belt—a little over  million years in age
mainly metallurgical coal is found in a damodar valley belt west bengal jharkhand which contains important coal mines of jharia raniganj and bokaro b the godavari valley belt c the mahanadi valley belt and d wardha valley belt
 they are comparatively younger
they occur in north-eastern states namely a assam b meghalaya c arunachal pradesh and d nagaland
petroleum it is the second most important energy source of india after coal
it can be easily trans-ported by pipelines and does not leave any residue
it provides fuel for heat and light
it provides lubricants for machinery
it provides raw material for a number of manufacturing industries
it is an important fuel used in transportation sector
petroleum refineries act as a ‘nodal industry’ for synthetic textiles fertilizers and many chemical industries
occurrence and formation of petroleum most of the petroleum occurrences in india are associated with anticlines and fault traps in the rock formations of the tertiary age
in regions of folding anticlines it occurs where oil is trapped in the crest of the upfold
the oil bearing layer is porous limestone or sandstone through which oil may flow
petroleum is also found in fault traps between porous and non-porous rocks
mumbai high—it is an offshore oilfield and is the richest oilfield of india
its share is about % of india’s petroleum production 
gujarat—it produces % petroleum of india
ankaleshwar is the most important field and 
assam—it is the oldest oil producing state of india
its contribution in the total production is %
important oilfields are digboi naharkatiya and moran-hugrijan
non-conventional sources of energy  nuclear energy nuclear energy is obtained by altering the structure of atom
when the structure of an atom is altered too much energy is released in the form of heat
this heat is utilised to generate electric power
uranium and thorium are used for generating atomic power
these minerals are available in jharkhand aravalli ranges of rajasthan
 solar energy photovoltaic technology is used to convert solar energy into electricity
the largest solar plant of india is located at madhapur near bhuj
it can help in minimizing the dependence on firewood and animal dung cakes in rural areas
this will also help in conservation of fossil fuels
 wind power the wind farm cluster in tamil nadu from nagarcoil to madurai is the largest cluster in india
andhra pradesh karnataka gujarat kerala maharashtra and lakshadweep are also important centres of wind power production
india is now a “wind super power” in the world
 biogas biogas can be produced from shrubs farm waste and animal and human waste
it is more efficient than kerosene dung cake and charcoal
biogas plants can be set up at municipal cooperative and individual levels
the gobar gas plants provide energy and also manure
 tidal energy dams are built across inlets
the water flows into the inlet during high tide and gets trapped when the gate is closed
once the tide recedes the floodgates are opened so that water can flow back to the sea
the flow of water is used to run the turbine to generate electricity
a  mw tidal energy power plant is set up by the national hydropower corporation in the gulf of kuchchh
 geo thermal energy we know that the inside of the earth is very hot
at some places this heat is released on the surface through fissures
groundwater in such areas becomes hot and rises up in the form of steam
this steam is used to drive turbines
two geo thermal energy projects—the parvati valley near manikam in himachal pradesh and the puga valley in ladakh
importance of energy energy is required for all activities
it is needed to cook to provide light and heat to propel vehicles and to drive machinery in industries
it is the basic requirement for economic development
every sector of national economy— agriculture industry transport and commerce needs greater inputs of energy
energy demands in the form of electricity are growing because of increasing use of electrical gadgets and appliances
ways to conserve energy 
using more of public transport system instead of individual vehicles
switching off electrical devices when not in use using power saving devices
using non-conventional sources of energy such as solar energy wind energy etc
getting the power equipment regularly checked to detect damages and leakages
production of goods in large quantities after processing from raw materials to more valuable products is called manufacturing
manufacturing belongs to secondary sector in which the primary materials are processed and converted into finished goods
importance of manufacturing industries for india 
it helps in modernizing agriculture reduces heavy dependence on agricultural income by providing jobs in non-agricultural sectors
industries help in creating jobs and generating more income
export of manufactured goods expands trade and brings in foreign exchange
industrial development brings prosperity to the country
agriculture and industry in india are interdependent on each other agro-industries in india have boosted agriculture by raising its productivity
industries depend on agriculture for their raw materials e
industries provide many agricultural inputs like irrigation pumps fertilizers insecticides pvc pipes machines and tools etc
development of different modes of transport by industrial sector has not only helped farmers to obtain agricultural inputs but has also helped them trade their products
factors which affect the location of an industry  raw material
cheap and abundant availability of raw material
availability of cheap labor is necessary for low cost of production low
cheap and continuous supply of power is extremely necessary
it is necessary for developing infrastructure for the entire manufacturing process and for meeting manufacturing expenditure
 banking and insurance facilities favorable government policies
five basis on which industries are classified
 on the basis of source of raw materials used — agro-based and mineral- based
 according to their main role — basic and consumer industries
 on the basis of capital investment — small-scale and large-scale industries
 on the basis of ownership — public sector private sector cooperative sector joint sector
 based on the bulk and weight of raw material and finished goods — heavy industries light if the investment is more than one crore rupees in any industry it is considered as a large scale industry
for example iron and steel industry cement industry
if the investment is less than one crore rupees it is considered as a small scale industry
agro-based industries they obtain their raw materials from agricultural products
example textiles— cotton jute silk and woolen
rubber sugar coffee tea and edible oil etc
mineral-based industries they obtain their raw materials from minerals
example iron and steel cement machine tools petro-chemicals etc
four types of industries based on ownership are 
public sector industries owned and operated by government agencies e
private sector industries are owned and operated by an individual or a group of individuals e
 ttsco bajaj auto ltd
joint sector industries are jointly run by the public government and private sector individuals e
cooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials workers or both
they pool in the resources and share the profits or losses proportionately e
 sugar industry in maharashtra and coir industry in kerdla
the textile industry occupies a unique position in the indian economy because it contributes significantly to industrial production %
it employs largest number of people after agriculture i
  million persons directly
its share in the foreign exchange earnings is significant at about 
it contributes % towards gdp and is the only industry in the country which is self-reliant and complete in the value chain
factors for concentrationlocation of cotton textile industry in maharashtra and-gujarat  availability of raw cotton was abundant and cheap
 moist climate in these coastal states also helped in the development of cotton textile industry because humid conditions are required for weaving the cloth else the yam breaks
 well developed transportation system and accessible port facilities in maharashtra and gujarat
 proximity to the market as cotton clothes are ideal to wear in these warm and humid states
problems faced by the cotton textile industry power supply is erratic in our country
machinery needs to be upgraded especially in weaving and processing sectors
we still need to import cotton in spite of the fact that the production of cotton in the country has increased
stiff competition from the synthetic fiber industry
factors responsible for the concentration of jute industry on the banks of hoogly 
proximity of the jute producing areas to the hoogly basin
inexpensive water transport provided by the hoogly river
it is well connected by a good network of railways waterways and roadways
abundant water for processing raw jute
availability of cheap labor from west bengalbihar odisha and uttar pradesh
kolkata as a port and large urban centre provides banking insurance and port facilities
reasons for location of sugar mills close to the fields 
the raw material used sugarcane is bulky and perishable
it cannot be transported to long distances because its sucrose content dries up fast so it should be processed within  hours of its harvest
sugar industry is shifting towards southern and western states because— cane produced here has higher sucrose content the favorable climatic conditions cooler climate ensure a longer growing and crushing season
the cooperatives are more successful in these states
sugar industry being seasonal in nature is ideal for the cooperative sector
yield per hectare is higher in southern states
iron and steel industry it is a basic or key and heavy industry
iron and steel industries is concentrated in and around chhotanagpur plateau region because  low cost of iron-ore which is mined here  high grade raw materials in close proximity  availability of cheap labour  vast growth potential in the home market  efficient transport network for their distribution  availability of power because this region has many thermal and hydel power plants  liberalisation and fdi
uses of aluminium  it is used for manufacturing aircraft’s  it is used for making utensils and packing material  it is used for making wires  it has gained popularity as a substitute of steel copper zinc and lead in a number of industries
electronic industry it produces a wide range of products from transistor sets to televisions and computers for the masses
it has helped us set up telephone exchanges telephones cellular telecom radios and many other equipment which have application in space technology aviation defense meteorological departments etc
it has generated employment for a large number of people
this industry has been a major foreign exchange earner because of its fast growing business process outsourcing bpo sector
india is one of the leading countries in software development
we have  software technology parks which provide high data communication facility to software experts
industrial pollution and its types  air pollution
smoke is emitted by chemical and paper factories brick kilns refineries and smelting plants and burning of fossil fuels in factories that ignore pollution norms
air-borne particulate materials contain both solid and liquid particles like dust sprays mist and smoke
major water pollutants are dyes detergents acids and salts
heavy metals like lead and mercury pesticides and fertilizers and synthetic chemicals with carbon plastics and rubber etc
discharged in the water bodies without treatment pollute these water bodies
the generators compressors machines furnaces looms exhaust fans etc
used by industries create a lot of noise
noise can raise blood pressure and can have physiological effects as well
land and water pollution are closely related
dumping of industrial wastes especially glass harmful chemicals industrial effluents packing salts and garbage into the soil
wastes from nuclear power plants nuclear and weapon production facilities cause cancer and birth defects
measures to control air pollution 
particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smoke stacks to factories with fabric filters electrostatic precipitators etc
equipment’s to control aerosol emissions can be used in industries e
 electrostatic precipitators scrubbers and inertial separators
smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal in factories
water pollution caused by industries can be controlled by 
minimizing the use of water for processing by reusing and recycling
harvesting of rain-water to meet water requirements of industries and other domestic purposes
treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds in the following ways primary treatment by mechanical means such as screening grinding flocculation and sedimentation
secondary treatment by biological process
tertiary treatment by biological chemical and physical processes
this involves recycling of waste water
pro-active approach adopted by the national thermal power corporation ntpc for preserving the natural environment and resources
optimum utilization and up-gradation of equipment by adopting latest techniques
minimizing waste generation by maximizing ash utilization
providing green belts for nurturing ecological balance
reducing environmental pollution through ash pond management ash water recycling system and liquid waste management
ecological monitoring reviews and online data base management for all its power stations
minimizing use of water for processing by reusing and recycling in two or more successive stages
harvesting of rain water to meet domestic and industrial water requirements
treating hot water and effluents before releasing them in rivers and ponds
particulate matter in the air can be reduced by fitting smoke to factories with electrostatic precipitators fabric filters scrubbers and inertial separators
smoke can be reduced by using oil or gas instead of coal in factories
machinery and equipments can be fitted with silencers to prevent noise pollution
roadways importance of road transport vis-a-vis rail transport—  construction cost of roads is much lower than that of railway lines
 roads can traverse comparatively more dissected and undulating topography
 roads can negotiate higher gradients of slopes and as such can traverse mountains such as the himalayas
 it also provides door-to-door service thus the cost of loading and unloading is much lower
 road transport is also used as a feeder to other modes of transport
six classes of roads in india according to their capacity  golden quadrilateral super highways it’s a major road development project linking delhi- kolkata-chennai-mumbai and delhi by six-lane super highways
 the north-south corridors linking srinagar jammu & kashmir and kanyakumari tamil nadu and east-west corridor connecting silcher assam and porbander gujarat are part of this project
‘  they are made to reduce the time and distance between the mega cities of india
national highways national highways link all major cities of extreme parts of the country
these are the primary road systems and are maintained by the central public works department cpwd
the national highway  between varanasi and kanyakumari is the longest highway of india
 state highways roads linking a state capital with different district headquarters
these roads are constructed and maintained by state public works department in state and union territories
 district roads these roads connect the district headquarters with other places of the district
these roads are maintained by the zila parishad
 other roads rural roads which link rural areas and villages with towns are classified under this category
under the pradhan mantri grameen sadak yojana scheme special provisions are made so that every village in the country is linked to a major town in the country by an all season motorable road
these roads are of strategic importance in the northern and northeastern border areas
railways also make it possible to conduct different activities like business sightseeing and pilgrimage along with transportation of goods over longer distances
indian railways plays a role of national integration
railways in india bind the economic life of the country as well as accelerate the development of the industry and agriculture
factors which influence the distribution pattern of railway network in india the distribution pattern of the railway network in the country has been largely influenced by physiographic economic and administrative factors
the density railway network is high in the northern plains because they are vast level land have high population density and rich agricultural resources
in the hilly terrains of the peninsular region railway tracts are laid through low hills gaps or tunnels therefore it difficult to construct railway lines
the himalayan mountainous regions too are unfavorable for the construction of railway lines due to high relief sparse population and lack of economic opportunities
it was difficult to lay railway lines on the sandy plain of western rajasthan swamps of gujarat forested tracks of madhya pradesh chhattisgarh odisha and jharkhand
importance of pipelines in india in the past these were used to transport water to cities and industries
now these are used for transporting crude oil petroleum products and natural gas from oil and natural gas fields to refineries fertilizer factories and big thermal power plants
solids can also be transported through a pipeline when converted into slurry
because of pipelines refineries like barauni mathura panipat and gas based fertilizer plants could be located in the interiors of india
initial cost of laying pipelines is high but subsequent running costs are minimal
it rules out trans-shipment during transportation losses or delays
three important networks of pipeline transportation in the country  from oil field in upper assam to kanpur uttar pradesh
 from salaya in gujarat to jalandhar in punjab
 gas pipeline from hazira in gujarat connects jagdishpur in uttar pradesh importance of water transport waterways are the cheapest means of transport
they are most suitable for carrying heavy and bulky goods
the national waterways by the government 
the ganga river between allahabad and haldia  km-n
the brahmaputra river between sadiya and dhubri  km-n
the west-coast canal in kerala kottapurma-komman udyogamandal and champakkara canals- km-n

paradip port it is located in odisha
it specialises in the export of iron ore
kolkata it is an inland riverine port
this port serves a very large and rich hinterland of ganga- brahmaputra basin
being a tidal port it requires constant dredging of floogly river
haldia port it was developed as a subsidiary port in order to relieve growing pressure on the kolkata port
importance of airways the air travel today is the fastest most comfortable and prestigious mode of transport
it can cover very difficult terrains like high mountains dreary deserts dense forests and also long oceanic stretches with great ease
air travel has made access easier in the north-eastern part of the country which has big rivers dissected relief dense forests and frequent floods and international frontiers
communication two major means of communication in india  personal communication including letter email telephone etc
 mass communication including television radio press films etc
different types of mail handled by indian postal department  first class mail cards and envelopes are airlifted between stations covering both land and air
 second class mail includes book packets registered newspapers and periodicals
they are carried by surface mail covering land and water transport
importance of mass communication mass communication provides entertainment
they create awareness among people about various national programmes and policies
they provide variety of programmes in national regional and local languages for various categories of people spread over different parts of the country
they strengthen democracy in the country by providing news and information to the masses
it helps in agriculture sector by helping farmers by providing them information about new agricultural practices
doordarshan is the national television channel of india
it is one of the largest terrestrial networks in the world
the largest numbers of newspapers published in the country are in hindi followed by english and urdu
india is the largest producer of feature films in the world
 it is also considered as economic barometer because advancement of international trade of a country leads to economic prosperity
income earned from international trade constitutes a major part in the net national income
large international trade leads to revival of domestic economy
balance of trade  the difference between export and import is known as balance of trade
 if the value of exports is more than the value of imports it is called favorable balance of trade
and if the value of imports is greater than the value of exports it is known as unfavorable balance of trade
 favorable balance of trade is regarded good for the economic development where as unfavorable balance of trade is seen harmful for the domestic economy
importance of tourism as a trade  tourism in india earns huge foreign exchange  over 
 million foreign tourists visit india every year
 more than  million people are directly engaged in the tourism industry
 tourism also promotes national integration  it provides support to local handicrafts and cultural pursuits
 it also helps in the development of international understanding about our culture and heritage
 foreign tourists visit india for heritage tourism eco tourism adventure tourism cultural tourism medical tourism and business tourism
 rajasthan goa jammu and kashmir and temple towns of south india are important destinations of foreign tourists in india
the environment can broadly be classified into the natural and human environment
it is a combination of both natural as well as man-made phenomena
the natural environment comprises biotic plants and animals and abiotic- conditionsland water air etc
 whereas the man-made phenomena comprise the activities and interactions among human beings roads bridges etc
natural environment  land water air plants and animals comprise the natural environment
 lithosphere atmosphere hydrosphere and biosphere are the four domains of the natural environment
 the lithosphere is the solid crust or the outermost layer of the earth where we live
it contains landforms like mountains plateaus plains and valleys
 the hydrosphere is the domain of water
it comprises water bodies like rivers lakes seas oceans etc
 the atmosphere is the thin layer of air that surrounds the earth
it protects us from the harmful rays and scorching heat of the sun
 the biosphere is a narrow zone of the earth where land water and air interact with each other to support life
human environment  human beings interact with the environment and modify it according to their needs
 early humans adapted themselves to their natural surroundings
 with time humans learnt to grow new things domesticate animals and lead a settled life
 the industrial revolution transportation and information revolution made communication easier and speedy across the world
 man is destroying the environment through deforestation industrialisation etc
the environment in our basic life support system
it provides the air we breathe the water we drink the food we eat and the place where we live
thus the environment is the most important aspect of our life
the natural environment consists of land water air plants and animals
it refers to both biotic and abiotic conditions existing on the earth
the human environment refers to the activities creations and interactions among human beings
domains of environment—lithosphere hydrosphere atmosphere and biosphere
the lithosphere is the solid portion of the earth where we live
it is the domain that provides us forests grasslands for grazing land for agriculture and human settlements
it is where we find several minerals
hydrosphere refers to the water bodies like rivers lakes seas oceans etc
that exist on the earth
it protects us from the harmful rays and searching heat of the sun
it consists of gases dust and water vapour
biosphere or the living world is comprised of plant and animal life
it is a narrow zone of the earth where land water and air interact with each other to support life
an ecosystem can be found in lakes mountains oceans pond etc
human beings modify the natural environment as per their needs
abiotic it refers to the world of non-living elements such as land
hydrosphere it refers to the water bodies like rivers lakes seas oceans etc
atmosphere it is the thin layer of air that surrounds the earth
barter system a trade in which goods are exchanged without the use of money
 constant changes take place inside as well as outside the earth
what is the interior of the earth  the earth is made up of three concentric layers-crust mantle and core
 the uppermost layer over the earth’s surface is called the crust
it is about  km thick on the continental masses and only  km thick on the ocean floor
it is made up of silica and alumina and thus called sial
 the oceanic crust mainly consists of silica and magnesium called sima
just below the crust is the mantle up to an extent of  km
 the innermost layer is the core with a radius of  km
as it is made of nickel and iron it is called nifeni-nickel and fe-ferrous i
the central core has a very high temperature and pressure
rocks and minerals  the earth’s crust is made of various types of rocks
any natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth’s crust is called a rock
 there are three major types of rocks igneous rocks sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks
 when the molten magma cools it becomes solid
rocks thus formed are called igneous or primary rocks
they are of two types extrusive igneous rocks and intrusive igneous rocks
 rocks roll down and break into small fragments and these smaller particles are called sediments
these sediments are transported compressed and hardened to form layers of rocks
these types of rocks are called sedimentary rock
the process of transformation of the rock from one to another is called the rock cycle
 rocks are made of different minerals
minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition
the earth is constantly undergoing changes inside and outside
therefore it is called a dynamic planet
the earth is made up of several concentric layers
the uppermost layer over the earth is the surface is called the crust
it is the thinnest of all the layers
the mantle is just beneath the crust
the innermost layer is the core with a radius of about  km
the central core has a very high temperature and pressure
the earth’s crust is made up of several types of rocks
there are three types of rocks—igneous rocks sedimentary rocks and metamorphic rocks
igneous rocks are also called primary rocks
they are of two types— intrusive rocks and extrusive rocks
extrusive igneous rocks have a very fine-grained structure
intrusive igneous rocks are formed deep inside the earth
granite is an example of this rock
for example sandstone is made from grains of sand
igneous and sedimentary rocks can change into metamorphic rocks under great heat and pressure
for example clay changes into slate and limestone into marble
hard rocks are used for making roads houses and buildings
one type of rock changes to another type under certain conditions in a cyclic manner
this process of transformation of the rock from one to another is known as the rock cycle
rocks are made up of various minerals
minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition
minerals are very essential for human beings
crust the uppermost layer over the earth’s surface
soal the continental mass of the crust consisting of silica and alumina is called sial si-silica and al-alumina
it is therefore called sima si-silica and ma-magnesium
mantle this layer is just beneath the crust
it extends up to a depth of  km
rock a rock is a natural mass of mineral matter that makes up the earth’s crust
igneous rock these rocks are formed by cooling and solidifying molten magma
lava it is fiery red molten magma coming out from the interior of the earth on its surface
extrusive igneous rock when the molten lava comes on the earth’s surface it rapidly cools down and becomes solid
rocks formed in this way on the crust are called extrusive igneous rocks
intrusive igneous rock when the molten magma cools down deep inside the earth’s crust solid intrusive igneous rocks are formed
sediments these are small fragments of rocks
sedimentary rock when loose sediments are compressed and hardened layers of rocks are formed
these types of rocks are known as sedimentary rocks
rock cycle the process of transformation of the rock from one to another is known as the rock cycle
mineral minerals are naturally occurring substances which have certain physical properties and definite chemical composition
the movement of these plates causes changes on the surface of the earth
the forces that act in the interior of the earth are called endogenic forces while the forces that work on the surface of the earth are called exogenic forces
endogenic force causes earthquakes and volcanic eruptions
exogenic force causes weathering erosion deposition and gradation
weathering is the breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s crust
erosion is the breaking away of the landscape by different agents like water wind and ice
sudden movements like earthquake and volcanoes cause most destruction over the surface of the earth
a volcano is a vent opening in the earth’s crust through which molten material erupts suddenly
the vibration in the plates of earth is called an earthquake
the place in the crust where the movement starts is called the focus
the place on the surface above the focus is called the epicenter
although earthquakes cannot be predicted the impact can certainly be minimized
major landforms  the landscapes are continuously worn away by two forces weathering and erosion
 weathering is the breaking down of the rocks on the earth’s surface
 erosion is the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water wind and ice
work of a river  when the river tumbles at a steep angle over hard rocks or down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall
 as the river enters the plain it twists and turns forming large bends known as meanders
 at this point of time the meander loop cuts off from the river and forms a cut-off called an ox-bow lake
 during flooding the river deposits layer of fine soil and other materials called sediments along its banks
this leads to the formation of a flat fertile plain called flood plain
 the raised banks along the river are called levees
 the collection of sediments from all the mouths forms a delta
work of sea waves  the erosion and deposition of the sea waves give rise to coastal landforms
 due to sea waves hollow caves are formed on the rocks
they are called sea caves
 as cavities become bigger in size only the roof of the caves remains thus forming sea arches
 the erosion further breaks the roof and only walls are left
work of ice  glaciers are rivers of ice which erode the landscape by bulldozing soil and stones to expose the solid rocks below
 the materia carried by the glaciers such as big and small rocks sand and silt get deposited
these deposits form glacial moraines
work of winds  an active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts is wind
it makes rocks in shape of a mushroom called mushroom rocks
 when the wind stops blowing the sand falls and get deposited in low hill-like structures
these are called sand dunes
 when the grains of sand is very fine and light the wind can carry it over long distances
when such sand is deposited in large areas it is called loess
the lithosphere is broken into numerous plates known as the lithospheric plates
these plates move around very slowly
the movement of these plates causes changes on the surface of the earth
the earth movements are divided on the basis of the forces which cause them
the forces which act in the interior of the earth are known as endogenic forces
the forces which work on the surface of the earth are called as exogenic forces
endogenic forces sometimes produce sudden movements which cause earthquakes and volcanoes
when the lithospheric plates move the surface of the earth vibrates
the vibrations can travel all round the earth
these vibrations are known as earthquakes
the place in the crust where the movement starts is known as the focus
the epicentre of the earthquake is the place on the surface above the focus
maximum damage occurs near the epicentre
some common earthquake prediction methods include studying animal behaviour fish in the ponds get agitated snakes come to the surface
the damage caused due to earthquakes can be minimised if we are prepared beforehand
during an earthquake one can take shelter under a kitchen counter table or desk against an inside corner or wall
one should be away from fireplaces areas around chimneys windows etc
weathering and erosion are two processes due to which the landscape is being continuously worn away
weathering is the breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s surface
erosion is the wearing ‘ away of the landscape by different agents like water wind etc
when the river tumbles at a steep angle over very hard rocks or down a steep valley side it forms a waterfall
large bends formed by twisting and turning of the river while entering the plain are called meanders
flood plains are fertile areas formed by the deposition of fine soil and other material sediments during floods
levees are the raised banks of the rivers
the streams which distribute the waters of a river are known as distributaries
the triangular deposits at the mouth of a river from the delta which is very fertile
the erosion and deposition of the sea waves give rise to coastal landforms
hallow like caves are formed on the rocks at the coast due to erosional work of sea waves
these formations are called sea caves
when these cavities become very big only the roof of the caves remains forming sea arches
this roof sometimes breaks due to erosion and thus only walls are left
these wall-like features are known as stacks
the steep rocky coast rising almost vertically above seawater is called sea cliff
the sea waves deposit sediments along the shores forming beaches
the landscape is eroded due to glaciers which are rivers of ice
the material carried by the glacier such as rocks sand and silt gets deposited and forms glacial moraines
the wind is an active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts
when the wind blows it lifts and transports said from one place to another
when very fine and light and gets deposited in large areas it called loess
endogenic forces the forces that act in the interior of the earth are called endogenic forces
exogenic forces the forces that act on the surface of the earth are called as exogenic forces
earthquake the vibrations caused by the movement of the lithospheric plates are called earthquakes
focus the place in the crust where the movement starts is called the focus
weathering the breaking up of the rocks on the earth’s surface is known as weathering
erosion the wearing away of the landscape by different agents like water wind and ice is called erosion
waterfall a place where a river or stream fails from a high place for example over a cliff or rock is known as waterfall
meander large bends formed by the twisting and turning of a river while entering a plain are known as meanders
floodplains floodplains are areas where fine soil and other material get deposited during floods
levees the raised banks of a river is known as levees
distributary as the river approaches the sea the speed of the flowing water decreases and the river begins to break up into a number of streams called distributaries
delta it is a triangular area of land where a river has split into many smaller rivers before entering the sea
sea caves sea caves are hollow like caves formed on the rocks
sea arches when the cavities become very big only the roof of the caves remains known as sea arches
stacks further erosion breaks the roof and only wall-like features remain
these features are called stacks
beaches the sea waves deposit sediments along the shores to form beaches
mushroom rocks in deserts rocks in the shape of a mushroom are very common
these are called mushroom rocks
sand dunes in deserts when the winds stop blowing the sand falls and gets deposited in low hill-like structures known as sand dunes
loess when very fine and light grains of sand gets deposited in large areas it is called loess
composition of the atmosphere  nitrogen and oxygen are the two gases which make up the bulk of the atmosphere
 carbon dioxide helium ozone argon and hydrogen are found in lesser quantities
 apart from these gases tiny dust particles are also present in the air
structure of the atmosphere  our atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from the earth’s surface
 the first layer is the troposphere whose average height is  km
the troposphere is the layer in which the air we breathe exist
almost all weather phenomena occur here
 the second layer is the stratosphere which extends up to  km
 the third layer is the mesosphere which extends up to the height of  km
 the fourth layer is the thermosphere which extends from  km to  km
 the uppermost layer of the atmosphere is exosphere which has very thin air
weather and climate  weather is the hour-to-hour day-to-day condition of the atmosphere
 climate is the weather conditions for a large period and of a large area
 the temperature of the atmosphere changes not only between day and night but also from season to season an important factor that influences the distribution of temperature is insolation
 insolation is the incoming solar energy intercepted by the earth
 the amount of insolation decreases from the equator towards the poles
 temperature is measured in celsius and fahrenheit
air pressure  air pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the weight of air on the earth’s surface
 horizontally the distribution of air pressure is influenced by the temperature of the air at a given place
 in areas having a lower temperature the air is cold
 the air always moves from high-pressure areas to low-pressure areas
wind  the movement of air from high-pressure areas to the low-pressure area is called wind
 winds can be broadly divided into three types permanent winds seasonal winds and local winds
 on  october  cyclonic winds originated as depression and affected odisha killing thousands of people
moisture  when water evaporates from land and other water bodies it becomes water vapour
 moisture in the air at any time is known as humidity
 when the water vapour rises it starts cooling
the water vapour condenses causing the formation of droplets of water
 when these droplets of water become too heavy to float in the air they come down as precipitation
 precipitation is the falling of moisture in the form of rainfall snow fog sleet and hailstones
 rainfall is very important for the survival of plants and animals
the atmosphere is a thin blanket of air that surrounds the earth
it protects us from the harmful rays of the sun
it consists of the main nitrogen % and oxygen %
carbon dioxide helium ozone argon and hydrogen are found in lesser quantities
nitrogen is very important for plants
their survival depends on this gas
oxygen is essential for humans and animals
they breathe in oxygen produced by green plants during photosynthesis
green plants take in carbon dioxide which is released by humans and animals
thus there is a mutual relation between the plants and the humans or animals
hence we should protect plants and trees for our own benefit
the atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from the earth’s surface
these layers are—troposphere stratosphere mesosphere thermosphere and exosphere
the troposphere is the layer in which the air we breathe exists
almost all weather phenomena occur here
the stratosphere contains a layer of ozone gas
the mesosphere extends up to the height of  km
meteorites burn up in this layer on entering from the space
thermosphere helps in radio transmission
exosphere is the uppermost layer where the air is very thin
climate is the average weather condition of a place for a longer period of time
the temperature of the atmosphere remains changing
the degree of hotness and coldness of the air is known as temperature
insolation is an important factor that influences the distribution of temperature
the amount of insolation decreases from the equator towards the poles
therefore the temperature decreases in the same way
air above us presses us from all directions with a great force on our body and our body exerts a counter pressure
air pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of air on the earth’s surface
as we go up the layers of the atmosphere the pressure falls rapidly
low pressure is associated with cloudy skies and wet weather
high pressure is associated with clear and sunny skies
the air always moves from high-pressure areas to a low-pressure area
wind is the movement of air from the high-pressure area to low pressure areas
at times it may be strong and devastating
winds are of three types—permanent winds seasonal winds and local winds
a humid day is one when the air is the fall of water vapour
on a humid day clothes take longer to dry and sweat from our body does not evaporate easily
when these droplets of water become very heavy they come down as precipitation
precipitation that comes down to the earth in liquid form is called rain
there are three types of rain on the basis of mechanism—the conventional rainfall the orographic rainfall and the cyclonic rainfall
constituents of air structure of the atmosphere atmosphere atmosphere is a thin blanket of air that surrounds the earth
weather the hour-to-hour day-to-day condition of the atmosphere is known as weather
climate the average weather condition of a place for a longer period of time is known as the climate of a place
temperature the degree of hotness and coldness of the air is known as temperature
isolation isolation is the incoming solar energy intercepted by the earth
air pressure the pressure exerted by the weight of air on the earth’s surface is known as air pressure
wind wind is the movement of air from the high-pressure area to low pressure areas
moisture water vapour present in the atmosphere is known as moisture
humidity moisture in the air is known as humidity
cloud it is a mass of water droplets
precipitation falling of water on the earth in the form of rainfall is known as precipitation
thermometer it is an instrument that measures temperature
barometer it measures atmospheric pressure
wind vane it shows the direction of the wind
the sun’s heat causes evaporation of water vapour
when the water vapour cools down it condenses and forms clouds
from there it may fall on the land or sea in the form of rain snow or sleet
the process by which water changes its form and circulates between oceans atmosphere and land is known as the water cycle
our earth is like a terrarium
the major source of fresh water are the rivers ponds springs and glaciers
the ocean bodies and the seas contain salty water
distribution of water on earth  about three-fourths of the earth’s surface is covered by water
 on earth % of water is saline and % of water is fresh water
movements  unlike the calm water of ponds and lakes ocean water keeps moving continuously
 the movements which occur in oceans are of three types waves tides and currents
waves  when the water on the surface of the ocean rises and falls alternately they are called waves
 an earthquake a volcanic eruption or underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean water
as a result huge tidal wave may be formed which is called tsunami
 tsunami in south and south-east asian coast had caused havoc in december 
tides  the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called a tide
 tides are of two types spring tides and neap tides
ocean currents  ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in different directions
 ocean currents are of two types warm and cold
 the labrador ocean current is a cold current while the gulf stream is a warm current
water is very important for our survival
it continuously changes its form and circulates between oceans and atmosphere
we get fresh water from the rivers ponds springs and glaciers
three-fourth of the earth surface is covered by water
but all the water on earth is not available to us
% of water is saline or salty found in oceans and seas
only % is fresh water
its % is available to us which we use in our daily life
many countries are facing water scarcity due to this fact
what is available is also not fit for drinking because it is polluted badly due to a variety of reasons
ponds and lakes have calm water whereas ocean water keeps moving continuously
the movements that occur in oceans can be categorized as waves tides and currents
when the water on the surface of the ocean rises and falls alternately they known as waves
during stormy weather huge waves are formed
these waves are very strong and cause heavy destruction
tsunami a huge tidal wave is very strong
the tsunami of  caused widespread damage in the coastal areas of india
tides are the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water which occur twice in a day
it is high tide when water covers much of the shore by rising to its highest level
it is low tide when waterfalls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore
during the full moon and new moon days the sun the moon and the earth are in the same line and the tides are highest
these tides are called spring tides
when the moon is in its first and last quarter the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the gravitational pull of sun and earth resulting in low tides
these tides are called neap tides
ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions
ocean currents may be warm or cold
the labrador ocean current is cold current while the gulf stream is a warm current
the areas where the warm and cold currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of the world
evaporation it is the process through which water turns into vapour
condensation it is the process in which water vapour turns into water droplets
water cycle it is the process by which water continually changes its form and circulates between oceans atmosphere and land
terrarium it is an artificial enclosure for keeping small house plants
precipitation falling of moisture in the form of rainfall snow sleet and hailstone
waves when the water on the surface of the ocean rises and falls alternately they are called waves
tsunami tsunami is a huge tidal wave
tide tide is the rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water that occurs twice in a day
these tides are called spring tides
neap tide when the moon is in its first and last quarter the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the gravitational pull of sun and earth resulting in low tides
these tides are called neap tides
ocean currents these are streams of water flowing constantly on the ocean surface in definite directions
natural vegetation can be categorised into three categories namely forest grassland and desert
the change in the type of natural vegetation occurs mainly because of the changes of climatic conditions
forests  forests grow where temperature and rainfall are plentiful to support a tree cover
 forests are of six types tropical evergreen tropical deciduous temperate evergreen temperate deciduous mediterranean vegetation and coniferous forests
 tropical evergreen forests are those which occur in the region near the equator and close to the tropics
 tropical deciduous forests are monsoon forests which shed their leaves in the dry season to conserve water
 temperate evergreen forests are located in the mid-latitudinal coastal region
 temperate deciduous forests are those which shed their leaves in the dry season
 mediterranean vegetation is found around the mediterranean sea in europe
 coniferous forests are found in areas along the taiga
they are of two types—tropical grasslands which have tall coarse grass and temperate grasslands
 tropical grasslands occurs on either side of the equator and extend till the tropics
tropical grassland of africa is called savannah
 temperate grasslands are in mid-latitudes and are called prairies steppes etc
the grass is usually short here
thorny bushes  thorny bushes are found in the dry desert-like regions
 these are found in areas with scanty rain and scorching heat
tundra vegetation  mosses lichens and very small shrubs are found in cold regions
this is called tundra type vegetation
 it is found in polar areas
trees grass lichen mosses etc
that grow naturally without human interference constitute natural vegetation
the growth of natural vegetation depends on temperature and moisture
it also depends on factors such as slope and thickness of soil
natural vegetation is classified into three categories—forests grasslands and shrubs
the changes in the type of natural vegetation occur mainly because of the changes in climatic condition
forests grow where temperature and rainfall are plentiful to support a tree cover
forests may be dense and open
hardwood trees such as rosewood ebony mahogany are common here
tropical deciduous forests are monsoon forests
they are found in the large part of india northern australia and in central america
they shed their leaves in dry seasons
trees like sal teak neem and shisham are found here
temperate evergreen forests are commonly found along the eastern margin of the continents
in these forests both hard and softwood trees such as oak pine eucalyptus etc
temperate deciduous forests are found in the northeastern part of usa china new zealand and chile
they shed their leaves in the dry season
trees like oak ash beech etc
and animals like deer foxes wolves are common in these forests
mediterranean vegetation is mostly found in the areas around the mediterranean sea in europe africa and asia
mediterranean vegetation is mainly comprised of citrus fruits such as oranges figs olives and grapes
coniferous forests are also known as traga
these forests are found in the higher latitudes of northern hemisphere
they are also found in the higher altitudes
the trees are tall softwood evergreen trees
chir pine cedar is an important variety of trees in these forests
animals such as silver fox mink polar bear are common here
grasslands include tropical and temperate grasslands
tropical grasslands grow in the areas of moderate to low amount of rainfall
savannah grasslands of africa present a suitable example of these types of grasslands
animals like elephants zebras giraffes dear are commonly found here
temperate grasslands are found in the mid-latitudinal zones and in the interior part of the continents
short and nutritious grass in found here
common animals are buffaloes bison antelopes etc
here vegetation cover is scarce because of poor rain and scorching heat
polar regions are cold and their natural vegetation is limited here
only mosses lichens and very small shrubs are found here
vegetation found in the polar regions is called tundra type of vegetation
seal walruses musk-oxen arctic owl etc
natural vegetation trees grass lichens mosses etc
that grow naturally without the interference of human beings are called natural vegetation
forests they grow where temperature and rainfall are plentiful to support a tree cover
forests may be dense and open
grasslands they grow in the region of moderate rain
shrubs these consists of thorny shrubs and scrubs
anaconda it is one of the world’s largest snakes found in the tropical rainforest
it means pure or untouched in the russian language
to grow food build homes and develop better means of transport and communication human beings have modified the environment
settlements  settlements are places where people build their homes
 the settlements earlier grew near the river valleys as the water was easily available and the land was fertile
 settlements can be permanent or temporary
 settlements which are occupied for a short time are called temporary settlements
 in permanent settlements people build homes to live in
 settlements can be rural or urban
rural settlements can be compact or scattered
 people in rural areas practice agriculture
in the urban area people are mostly engaged in services
transport  transport is the means by which people and goods move
 with the invention of the wheel transport became easier
 earlier donkeys mules bullocks and camels were used for transportation
 earlier traders took the land route or sea route for transportation
now it takes only - hours to travel from india to europe
 the four major means of transport are roadways railways waterways and airways
they can be metalled or unmetalled
railways  railways are the fastest means of land transport and can carry bulky materials over a long distance
 the railways carry people over long distances quickly and economically
 the invention of the steam engine and the industrial revolution helped in the speedy development of rail transport
 diesel and electric engine have largely replaced the steam engines
 now superfast trains have been introduced to make travelling faster
 indian railways network is the largest in asia
waterways  waterways are the cheapest means of transportation for carrying heavy and bulky goods over long distances
 there are mainly two types of routes inland waterways and sea routes

airways  airways are the fastest and most expensive mode of transport
 it is the only mode of transport to reach the most remote and distant areas especially where there are no roads and railways
 some major airports in the world are delhi mumbai new york london paris frankfurt and cairo etc
communication  process of conveying the message to others is known as communication
 different modes of communication are used to provide information to educate as well as to entertain
 through newspaper radio and television we can communicate with a large number of people
they are therefore called mass media
 satellites internet wireless telephone are the main modes of communication
places where people build their homes are called settlements
early settlements grew near the river valleys because of the easy availability of water and fertile land there
by and by human settlements became larger with the development of trade commerce and manufacturing
settlements are of two types—permanent and temporary
people make their temporary settlements in deep forests hot and cold deserts and mountains and practise hunting gathering shifting cultivation etc
under permanent settlements people build homes to live in
human settlements may be rural and urban
the villages are rural settlement where people do farming fishing forestry etc
rural settlements can be compact or scattered
in a compact settlement houses are built closely to each other
in a scattered settlement house are spaced over an extensive area
houses under rural settlements are built of mud clay stones straw etc
urban settlements are found in towns and cities
people here are engaged in manufacturing trading and services
transport is essential to go from one place to another
in the early days people travelled long distances on foot
they used animals to carry their goods
gradually several means of transport developed although animals like donkeys mules bullocks and camels continued to be used even today
it saves our precious time and energy
the four means of transport are—roadways railways waterways and airways
roads can be metalled and unmetalled
manali-leh highway in the himalayan mountain is one of the highest roadways in the world
roads built underground are called subwaysunder paths
flyovers are built over raised structures
the railways carry people and heavy goods over long distances
the railway network is well developed over the plain areas
the indian railway network is well developed and is the largest in asia
waterways are the cheapest means of transport
they are used for carrying heavy and bulky goods over long distances
there are two types of waterways inland waterways and sea routes
navigable rivers and lakes are used as inland waterways
sea routes and oceanic routes are mostly used for transporting merchandise and goods from one country to another
these routes are connected with the ports
some important ports of the world are—singapore and mumbai in asia new york los angeles in north america rio de janeiro in south america durban and cape town in africa sydney in australia london and rotterdam in europe
it is the only mode of transport to reach the most remote and distant areas especially where there are no roads and railways
helicopters are useful in most inaccessible areas and in the time of calamities for rescuing people and other associated works
some important airports are delhi mumbai new york london paris frankfurt and cairo
the process by which we convey messages to others is known as communication
newspapers radio and television are important means of communication
they are called mass media because we can communicate with a large number of people at the same time
the satellites have made communication even faster
wireless telephonic communications through cellular phones have become very popular today
the internet provides us with worldwide information and interaction
settlement it refers to a place where people build their homes
transhumance it is a seasonal movement of people
compact settlement it is a closely built area of dwellings
scattered settlement when dwellings are spaced over an extensive area
transport it is the means by which people and goods move from one place to another
metalled roads these are pucca roads and are used in all the weather
unmetalled roads these are kutcha roads
they are out of work during the rainy season
subways underground roads are called subways
flyovers these are built over raised structures
communication the process through which we convey messages to others
mass media newspapers radio and television are called mass media because they communicate with a large number of people at the same time

depending upon the climate conditions grasslands can be divided into two categories the temperate grasslands and the tropical grasslands
the prairies  prairies are the temperate grassland found in north america
they are bound by the rocky mountains ‘ the west and the great lakes in the east
 for the most part prairies are tree-less but near the low-lying area’s woodlands can be found
the prairies are bound by the rocky mountains in the west and the great lakes in the east
 prairies cover major parts of the usa and canada
climate  climate is of continental type with extreme temperature ie with warm summers and very cold winters
 the annual rainfall is moderate and is ideal for the growth of grass
flora and fauna  prairies are practically tree-less but the places where water is available trees such as willows alders and poplars grow
 places that receive rainfall of over  cm are suitable for farming as the soil is fertile
 the prairies are known as the ‘granaries of the world’ because surplus wheat is produced here
 bison or american buffalo is the most important animal
 large scale farming with modern technology is done here
the velds  the temperate grasslands of south africa are called the velds
 velds are rolling plateaus with varying heights ranging from  m to  m
 it is bound by the drakensberg mountains on the east
climate  the welds have a mild climate due to the influence of the indian oceans
 here the summers are short and warm
 the velds receive rainfall mainly in the summer months from november to february
 winters are cold and dry
temperature varies between °c and °c and july is the coldest month
flora and fauna  vegetation cover is sparse
 red grass grows in bush velds
people  velds are known for cattle rearing and mining
 the main crops are maize wheat barley oats and potatoes
 the velds have a rich reserve of minerals
 iron and steel industry has developed where coal and iron are present
 johannesburg is known as the gold capital of the world
grassland is a region where grasses form the dominant type of plant life
grasslands make up almost a quarter of the total land surface
the prairies are the temperate grasslands in north america
they are bound by the rocky mountains in the west and the great lakes in the east
the prairies are located in the heart of the continent and therefore we find here the continental type of climate which is characterised by extreme temperatures
the annual rainfall is moderate and is ideal for the growth of grass
‘chinook’ a local wind blow here
trees are not there in the prairies
only trees like willows alders and poplars grow
crops like maize potatoes soybeans cotton and alfa-alfa are grown in the areas where rainfall is over  cm
in the areas with poor rainfall grasses are short and sparse
in these areas cattle¬rearing is done
bison or the american buffalo is the most important animal of this region
the people of this region are hardworking
the usa and canada are located in this region
the prairies are known as the ‘granaries of the world’ because surplus wheat is produced here
dairy farming is also a major industry
minerals such as coal and iron are found in abundance
roads railways and canals— all are in good condition and play an important role in making this region the most industrialised one in the world
they are bound by the drakensberg mountains on the east
to its west lies the kalahari desert
on the northeastern part high velds are located that attain a height of more than  m in some places
the velds are characterised by a mild climate
they receive rainfall mainly in the summer months from november to february
the velds do not have much vegetation
the popular varieties of grass are—red grass acacia and maroola
the animals found in this region are—lions leopards cheetah and kudu
cattle rearing and mining are two important activities in the velds
soils are not very fertile
the main crops are maize wheat barley oats and potato
cash crops grown here are tobacco sugarcane and cotton
the people of this region are mostly engaged in sheep rearing
merino sheep are very popular because its wool is very warm
dairy farming is also an important activity dairy product like butter cheese is produced for both domestic supply and also for export
the velds have a rich reserve of minerals
gold and diamond mining are major occupations of people of this region
johannesburg is famous for gold
it is known as the gold capital in the world
kimberley is famous for its diamond mines
prairie the word prairie has been originated from latin word priata which means meadow
chinook it is a hot wind that blows in winter and therefore raises the temperature within a short time
ranches they are large cattle farms
cowboys the sturdy men who look after the ranches
combine a single machine which can combine the tasks of sowing ploughing and threshing i
veld velds are the temperate grasslands of south africa
depending on the temperature there can be hot deserts or cold deserts
the hot desert – sahara  the sahara desert in africa is the world’s largest hot desert

 people of ladakh have over the centuries learnt to live in balance and harmony with nature
 pashmina wool of this region is famous
 leh and kargil are the main towns in ladakh
the desert areas of the world are characterised by low rainfall scanty vegetation and extreme temperatures
depending on the temperatures there are hot deserts as well as cold deserts
sahara is a hot desert covering a large part of north africa and ladakh is a cold desert lying in the great himalayas on the eastern side of jammu and kashmir in india
sahara is the world’s largest desert
the sahara desert touches eleven countries—algeria chad egypt libya mali mauritania morocco niger sudan tunisia and western sahara
the sahara desert is the vast stretches of sand
there are also gravel plains and elevated plantains with a bare rocky surface
the climate of the sahara desert is scorching hot and parched dry
the rainy season is very short
the day temperature may soar as high as °c
but nights may be freezing cold
date palms are found near an oasis
so far animals are concerned camels hyenas jackals foxes scorpions several varieties of snakes and lizards are found in this dessert
various groups of people such as the bedouins and tuaregs live in the sahara desert
these groups are a nomadic tribe and they rear goats sheep camels and horses
they get milk and hides from these animals
these nomadic tribes wear heavy robes to protect themselves from dust storms and hot winds
people get water from the oasis in the sahara desert and the nile valley in egypt
they grow crops like rice wheat barley and beans
the sahara desert is undergoing fast change due to the discovery of oil in algeria libya and egypt
other minerals found here are iron phosphorus manganese and uranium
trucks are now used in the salt trade
the nomadic herdsmen with a change of time are now migrating to cities for better job opportunities in oil and gas operations
ladakh is a cold desert

several rivers flow through ladakh
several glaciers are found here for example the gangotri glacier
the climate of ladakh is extremely cold and dry
the day temperatures in summer are just above zero degree and the night temperatures are below – °c
this desert receives very little rainfall
there is always a chance of both sunstroke and frostbite
there are scanty patches of grasses
groves of willows and poplars are seen in the valleys
the animals of ladakh are wild goats wild sheep yak and special kinds of dogs
people living in this desert are either muslims or buddhists

ladakh is being modernised fast
but people are very conscious here
they know the ways to live in balance and harmony with nature
desert it refers to an arid area characterised by extremely high or low temperatures with poor vegetation
oasis it is an area in the desert where there is water and where plants grow
shahtoosh it is kind of wool obtained from chiru or the tibetan antelope
gangri it is a glacier found in ladakh
tuaregs these are nomads of the sahara desert
khapa-chan ladakh is also known by this name
human beings are important resources because their ideas knowledge and skills lead to the creation of new resources
types of resources there are three types of resources—natural resources man-made resources and human resources
natural resources the resources which are drawn from nature and used without much modification are known as natural resources
human-made resources when the original form of natural resources is changed by human beings to make it more useful then it is called man-made resources or human-made resources
human resources people are human resources
education and health help to make people a valuable resource
on the basis of their development resources are classified as actual resources and potential resources
on the basis of their origin resources are classified as abiotic resources and biotic resources
on the basis of their distribution resources are classified as ubiquitous resources and localised resources
on the basis of their stock resources are classified as renewable resources and non-renewable resources
actual resources actual resources are those resources whose quantity is known
rich deposits of coal in ruhr region of germany dark soils of deccan plateau in maharashtra
potential resources those resources whose entire quantity may not be known and which are not being used at present time are known as potential resources e
uranium found in ladakh may be used as a potential resource
abiotic and biotic resources abiotic resources are non-living while biotic resources are living
soils rocks and minerals are abiotic while plants and animals are biotic resources
ubiquitous and localised resources resources that are found everywhere like the air we breathe are ubiquitous resources
but those which are found only in certain places are localized resources like copper and iron ore
renewable resources renewable resources are those which get renewed or replenished quickly e
non-renewable resources those resources which are present in limited stock and once exhausted may take thousands of years to renew e
we have to conserve the resources otherwise non-renewable resources will get exhausted and people will face a shortage of food and shelter
any substance living being or service that has utility i
can help us in any possible way is said to be a resource
the value can be associated with money i
you have to pay money to get it or just mental satisfaction e
when you look at a beautiful painting or scenery it feels pleasant so the painting or scenery has utility
examples of resources include books stationery material clothes utensils furniture your teacher school rivers water electricity and so on
the economic value of a resource may change with time
a substance may or may not be a resource depending on our knowledge
if we do not know how to write with a pen then certainly the pen has no utility for us
so in this case the pen is not a resource
however for those who know how to use a pen it is a resource
so technology ideas knowledge inventions discoveries etc
make a substance a resource
time may also be a factor involved in making a substance a resource
water has always been there but its utility to manufacture electricity was not always known
when people realized that water can be used to produce electricity water became a resource in a new way
resources may be natural human or human-made
natural resources are those that are taken from nature
they are used without modifying them i
in the same form as they exist in
rivers lakes air soils minerals trees mountains etc
on the basis of level of development of resource a natural resource can be actual or potential
an actual resource is one which is used currently
a potential resource is one whose utility is not known at present or is not used despite having utility instead it may be useful at some time in future
it means that it has the potential to have utility although it does not have any today
examples include uranium deposits in ladakh
on the basis of origin a resource can be abiotic or biotic
a biotic resource is one that has life
an abiotic resource is non-living
examples soils rocks furniture books
natural resources may also be classified as renewable and non-renewable
a renewable resource can be used without any risk of its ending up
they exist in unlimited quantity for example solar energy and wind energy
on the other hand use of non-renewable resources need to be controlled since once they end up they cannot be renewed
on the basis of distribution a resource can be ubiquitous or localised
a ubiquitous^ resource is found everywhere like air
a localised resource is however found in certain parts of the world only like we cannot find coal everywhere
human-made resources have not been provided to us by nature
human beings have used their intelligence to manufacture them for their own use
examples include vehicles buildings roads telephone etc
human resources include people who serve us in any way
your teacher doctor carpenter cobbler etc
human resource development refers to the improvement of people’s skills so that they become more useful than before and are a better resource
the future generations also need the resources but if we keep using them at a fast pace they may end up thus posing problems for the future
we should use resources in such a balanced way that we satisfy our needs as well as conserve them for the future
this concept is called sustainable development
we can contribute to sustainable development by switching off lights when not needed by recycling things and using them again and in many more ways
flow learning utility a substance has utility if it can be used in any possible way to satisfy our needs
value worth of a substance assessed on the basis of utility
patent it applies to the exclusive right over an idea or invention
resource any substance having utility in any way is a resource
technology the application of the latest knowledge and skills in doing or making things is called technology
natural resource natural resources are those that are taken from nature
actual resource an actual resource is one which is used currently and whose quantity is known
potential resource a potential resource is one whose utility is not known at present or is not used despite having utility instead it may be useful at some time in the future
biotic resource abiotic resource is a living resource
renewable resource a renewable resource can be used without any risk of its ending up because they exist in unlimited quantity
non-renewable resource a non-renewable resource is one which is present in limited quantity
ubiquitous resource a ubiquitous resource is one that is found everywhere
localized resource a resource that is found only in certain parts of the world and not everywhere
human-made resource resources invented by human beings by using their intelligence are called human-made resources
human resources a human being who can contribute to his family society or economy is called a
human resource development human resource development refers to the improvement of people’s skills so that they become more useful than before and are a better resource
the stock of resource the amount of resource available for use is called it’s stock
resource conservation resource conservation is the concept of using resources carefully so that they do not end up quickly
sustainable development it is the concept of using resources in a balanced way so that our purpose is solved as well as they are also conserved for the future
 land provides most of human needs
its use depends on physical factors such as topography soil climate mineral and availability of water and human factors
 due to the excessive use of land for agricultural and constructional activities the major problem of land degradation landslides soil erosion etc
 to conserve the land we must promote afforestation check to overgraze and regulate the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers
 deforestation overgrazing overuse of chemical fertilisers and pesticides rain wash landslides and floods leads to soil degradation
 conservation of soil can be done by mulching contour barriers constructing rock dam terrace farming intercropping contour ploughing and making shelterbelts
water  three-fourth of the earth surface is covered with water out of which only 
 per cent water is fresh water but only % of fresh water is available for human use
 the excessive use of water leads to a shortage in supply of fresh water either due to drying up of water sources or due to water pollution
 discharge of untreated sewage agricultural chemicals and industrial effluents in water bodies causes water pollution
 water conservation can be done by afforestation adopting effective techniques for irrigation and promoting rainwater harvesting
natural vegetation and wildlife  natural vegetation and wildlife exist only in the biosphere and they are interrelated and interdependent on each other for their survival
this system is called an ecosystem
 natural vegetation and wildlife both are valuable resources
they are not only useful for us but they also help in maintaining balance in nature
 major vegetations of the ecosystems are forests grasslands scrubs and tundra
 due to deforestation soil erosion constructional activities forest fires tsunami tundra landslides and poaching many species of vegetation and wildlife have become extinct and many others are on the verge of extinction
 we can conserve natural vegetation and wildlife by making national parks wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves
the quality of land soil water natural vegetation animals and the usage of technology are important factors in controlling the standard and way of life people lead at a particular place
it is not suitable for living everywhere because of a lot of additional conditions that affect life
parts of land not suitable for a living are said to be inhabitable while the ones where people live are said to be habitable
some factors affecting the habitability of a place are topography height from sea level climate the fertility of the soil vegetation etc
people cannot live in dense forests or in deserts
they cannot live on high slopes in mountainous areas or in low-lying areas where there is the possibility of floods and waterlogging
plains and river valleys are the places where agriculture is suited so most of the world population lives in such areas and these areas are heavily populated
the purpose and way in which land is used is called land use
land use may be for agriculture forestry mining building houses roads setting up of industries or various other purposes
factors determining the land use include physical factors like topography availability of water climate minerals soil etc or human factors like demography population pattern technology and education
it may be private land or community land
private land is owned by an individual or group of individuals like a house is private land
community land is meant for use by anyone in the society like land for collection of fodder fruits etc
community lands are also called common property resources
since the population is always growing at a fast pace the demand for land is increasing whereas the availability of land is limited
land degradation landslides soil erosion desertification are major threats to the environment
due to the huge demand for land people have also started reducing forest cover in order to make them habitable
this has resulted in deforestation
afforestation growing trees regulated use of chemical pesticide and checking overgrazing by animals are some general methods to conserve these valuable natural resources
the word soil refers to the thin layer of grainy substance covering the surface of the earth
the long process of weathering is responsible for the formation of soil
weathering refers to the breaking up and decay of exposed rocks
this breaking up and decay is caused by temperature fluctuations frost action plants animals and even human activity
due to weathering in thousands of years soil is formed
the nature of the parent rock and climatic factors are major factors of soil formation
soil erosion and depletion pose major threats to the quality and resourcefulness of soil
degradation takes place by both human and natural factors
deforestation overgrazing overuse of chemical fertilisers or pesticides rain wash landslides and floods lead to degradation of soil
this helps in retaining soil moisture
trenches are made in front of them to collect water
terrace farming is the method of farming in which broad flat steps or terraces are made on the steejp slopes so that flat surfaces are available to grow crops
this helps in controlling soil erosion
in intercropping different crops are grown in alternate rows and are sown at different times to protect the soil from being washed away by rain
ploughing parallel to the contours of a hill slope to form a natural barrier for water to flow down a slope is called contour ploughing
rows of trees are planted in certain areas to check wind movement
such rows are called shelterbelts
these trees are supposed to bind the soil thus preventing them from being eroded away easily
water covers about % of the surface of the earth
therefore the earth is called the water planet
ocean water is saline and not fit for human consumption
freshwater is just about 
% of tile total water
so fresh water is very scarce
we use water for a lot of purposes
life is impossible without water
water shortage is a common problem in many parts of the world
it may be a consequence of variation in rain patterns or contamination of water sources
steps need to be taken to conserve water
water is renewable but its overuse and pollution make it unfit for use
sewage industrial waste chemicals etc pollute water with nitrates metals and pesticides
natural vegetation and wildlife exist in the biosphere
the supporting and interdependent life-system that exists in the biosphere is called an ecosystem
plants provide us with a number of important products shelter to animals liberate oxygen which supports life protects soil and give us much of our food
animals birds and insects wildlife are also helpful in a lot of ways
insects like bees provide us honey and a bird like a vulture cleanses the environment by feeding on dead livestock
vegetation depends on temperature and moisture of a region
forests grasslands scrubs and tundra are major vegetation types across the world
heavy rainfall supports huge trees
low moisture means less dense forests and smaller trees
in deserts we have thorny shrubs and scrubs
forests are classified as evergreen and deciduous
the first type never shed their leaves but the second type shed their leaves at a particular time of the year
both these types are further classified into temperate and tropical based on their location
we must contribute to this
natural parks wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves are ways to protect vegetation and wildlife
conservation of plants and animals is a moral duty of every human being
flow chart land the surface of the earth which is solid and covers about % of the total surface of the earth is called land
land use the way in which a particular section of land is being used is called land use
private land a part of land owned by a particular individual or group of individuals is called private land
community land a part of land not owned by anyone but meant for use by a large group of people living in a society is called community land
deforestation the action of cutting down trees is called deforestation
afforestation the action of planting trees is called afforestation
soil the thin layer of grainy substance covering the surface of the earth is called soil
weathering weathering refers to the breaking up and decay of exposed rocks
this breaking up and decay is caused by temperature fluctuations frost action plants animals and even human activity
terrace farming terrace farming is the method of farming in which broad flat steps or terraces are made on the steep slopes so that flat surfaces are available to grow crops
intercropping in intercropping different crops are grown in alternate rows and are sown at different times to protect the soil from being washed away by rain
contour ploughing ploughing parallel to the contours of a hill slope to form a natural barrier for water to flow down a slope is called contour ploughing
shelter belts rows of trees that are planted in certain areas to check wind movement are called shelterbelts
fresh water water fit for human consumption is called fresh water
water cycle the natural process of the constant motion of water through evaporation condensation and rainfall is called the water cycle
rain water harvesting the process of conserving water in which rainwater is collected so that it can come of use in times of water scarcity is called rainwater harvesting
biosphere the narrow zone of contact between the lithosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere are called the biosphere
ecosystem the supporting and interdependent life-system that exists in the biosphere is called an ecosystem
natural vegetation plants and trees constitute natural vegetation
wildlife the animal kingdom which consists of animals birds aquatic creatures and insects is called a wildlife
scavenger a bird or animal which feeds on dead livestock is called a scavenger
tundra the type of vegetation found in very cold regions like the arctic is called tundra vegetation
evergreen forests the forests which never shed their leaves are called evergreen forests
deciduous forests the forests which shed their leaves once at a particular time o
f the year are called deciduous forests
national parks a national park is a natural area supposed to be used to protect the ecological integrity of one or more ecosystems for the present and future generations
wildlife sanctuaries a wildlife sanctuary is similar to a national park but it is supposed to protect a particular animal in some cases or wildlife in general in other cases
minerals are created by natural processes such as rock formation and are concentrated in a particular area
minerals are identified on the basis of their physical properties
they are extracted by the process of mining
there are two types of minerals metallic and non-metallic
metallic minerals such as iron ore nickel copper etc
 are found in igneous and metamorphic rocks
non-metallic minerals such as limestone and mineral fuels are found in sedimentary rock formation of plains and young fold mountains
minerals are essential for the economic development of any country
being non-renewable resources minerals should be used moderately
they can be conserved by reducing the wastage during mining recycling and using substitutes
power or energy plays a vital role in our lives
we depend on power to make our life more comfortable
power is needed not only in a home but also for running the activities of industry agriculture transport communication and defence
power sources can be broadly categorized into  conventional sources  non-conventional sources
the power sources which have been in common use for a long time are known as conventional sources
for example firewood fossil fuels like coal petroleum natural gas and hydropower
some new sources of energy which have been discovered in the recent past are called non- conventional sources of energy
important sources of non-conventional energy are—solar energy wind energy biomass energy geothermal energy through tides and waves etc
non-conventional sources of energy are non-polluting inexhaustible safe and clean
most of these are only in the experimentation stage and are being used as a different source of commercial energy to a very little extent
we must conserve the conventional power sources as they are limited in nature
so we must promote the use of alternative sources of power
minerals are found in certain areas only and not everywhere
minerals are formed in different conditions and human activities do not play any role in their formation
instead only natural processes are involved
minerals can be identified on the basis of their physical properties like color density hardness and chemipal properties like solubility
on the basis of composition we classify minerals as metallic and non-metallic
the metal is present in raw form that is it contains impurities and it needs to be processed in order to yield the pure metal
ferrous minerals and non-ferrous minerals are a classification of metallic minerals
examples are iron ore manganese ore and chromites
non-ferrous minerals do not contain iron as a constituent
examples include gold silver copper lead
non-metallic minerals do not contain metals
instead they contain impure compounds or mineral fuels
examples limestone mica coal and petroleum
extraction is the process of taking out minerals from under the earth’s surface so that useful materials can be derived from them
mining is a process of extraction or taking out minerals from rocks under the earth’s surface
in open-cast mining minerals lying at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer
in shaft mining deep bores called shafts are made to reach mineral deposits lying at large depths
drilling is another method of extraction in which deep wells are bored to take out minerals
quarrying refers to the process of extraction in which minerals lying very close to the surface are extracted just by digging them out
metallic minerals are generally found in igneous rocks and metamorphic rocks in plateaus
non-metallic minerals are usually found in a sedimentary rock formation in plains and young-fold mountains
major regions having large iron deposits are china and india in asia russia ukraine sweden and france in europe the canadian shield region in north america and brazil in south america
brazil is the largest producer of high grade iron ore
asia produces over half the total in production in the world
china leads in the production of lead antimony tin and tungsten
these are canadian region north of the great lakes the appalachian region and the mountain ranges in the western part of the continent
chile and peru in south america are leading producers of copper
brazil and bolivia are important producers of tin
africa is the continent richest in mineral resources
south america zimbabwe and zaire are the world’s most important producers of gold
australia produces the largest quantity of bauxite
it also produces gold diamond iron tin and nickel
the areas called kalgoorlie and coolgardie have large deposits of gold
in india high-grade iron ore is produced in jharkhand odisha chhattisgarh madhya pradesh goa maharashtra and karnataka
bauxite is produced in jharkhand orisha chhattisgarh madhya pradesh gujarat maharashtra and tamil nadu
mica deposits are found in jharkhand bihar andhra pradesh and rajasthan
india is the largest producer and exporter of mica in the world
kolar in karnataka has large deposits of gold
india is a leading producer and exporter of salt
minerals are used for a lot of purposes
copper is a metal used in nearly everything
silicon is obtained from quartz
it is a basic tool of the computer industry
minerals are non-renewable since their formation is a long process
recycling of metals and reducing wastage are ways to conserve them
we require power for everything
power resources are of two types conventional and non-conventional
conventional power sources are those that have been in use for a long time
fossil fuels and firewood are examples
non-conventional power sources are those power sources that have come into use recently due to the depleting conventional resources and growing awareness
firewood is widely used in india for cooking and heating
fossil fuels are what the remains of plants and animals converted into after they remained buried under the earth for millions of years
coal petroleum and natural gas are important fossil fuels
electricity from coal is called thermal power
petroleum and its derivatives are called black gold because of their importance
natural gas is found with petroleum deposits
hydel power is the energy possessed by river water stored in dams or rain water falling from great heights
one-fourth of the world’s electricity is produced from hydel power
solar energy wind energy geothermal energy nuclear power and tidal energy are examples of non-conventional power sources
solar cells help to convert this energy to electricity
solar energy is used in solar heaters solar cookers solar dryers etc
wind energy is the energy possessed by moving air wind
windmills are used to^\ convert wind energy to electricity
wind farms having clusters of windmills are located in coastal regions and mountain passes
nuclear power is energy possessed by the nuclei of atoms of naturally occurring radioactive elements like uranium thorium etc
geothermal energy is the heat energy obtained from the inside of the earth
the temperature inside the earth increases as we go deeper
this heat is used to produce electricity
it is accessed in the form of hot springs
tidal energy is the energy generated from tides
it is harnessed by building dams at narrow openings of the sea
it is an excellent fuel for cooking and lighting and is environment-friendly
flow learning mineral a naturally occurring substance having a definite chemical composition is called a mineral
ore an ore is a rock from which minerals are mined
metallic minerals metallic minerals are those containing metal
the metal is present in raw form that is it contains impurities and it needs to be processed in order to yield the pure metal
ferrous minerals ferrous minerals are the ones containing iron as a constituent
non-ferrous minerals non-ferrous minerals are the ones that do not contain iron as a constituent
non-metallic minerals non-metallic minerals are the ones that do not contain metals
instead they contain impure compounds or mineral fuels

fossil fuels fossil fuels are what the remains of plants and animals converted into after they remained buried under the earth for millions of years
thermal power the electricity obtained from coal is called thermal power
coal coal is a fossil fuel that was formed millions of years ago when giant ferns and swamps got buried under the layers of the earth
petroleum petroleum is a thick black liquid fossil fuel found between layers of rocks and drilled from oil fields
solar energy solar energy is the heat and light energy captured from the sun
solar cell solar cells are devices to convert solar energy into electricity
wind energy wind energy is the energy possessed by moving air wind
nuclear power nuclear power is energy possessed by the nuclei of atoms of naturally occurring radioactive elements like uranium thorium etc
geothermal energy geothermal energy is the heat energy obtained from the inside of the earth
tidal energy tidal energy is the energy generated from tides
there are three types of economic activities  primary activities  secondary activities  tertiary activities
agriculture is a primary activity
nearly rd of india’s population is engaged in agricultural activities
growing of crops raising livestock forestry and fishing all come under agricultural activities
there are mainly two types of farming techniques  subsistence farming  commercial farming
when a farmer tills the land till the soil loses its fertility and then shifts to another fertile land then this type of farming is known as shifting cultivation
the efforts made to increase farm production in order to meet the growing demands of the increasing population is known as agricultural development
it varies in developed and developing countries
agriculture an activity that is related directly to the extraction and production of natural resources is a primary activity
manufacturing of steel and baking of bread are secondary activities since they are not directly related to the extraction or production of natural resources but their utilisation
transport and trade are tertiary activities since they do not come in either category
two-thirds of india’s population depends on agriculture
some of the important inputs required in agriculture are seeds fertilisers machinery and labour
operations involved are ploughing sowing irrigation weeding and harvesting
outputs include cops wool dairy and poultry products
two main types of farming practised are subsistence farming and commercial farming
subsistence farming is practised solely to meet the needs of the farmer’s family
therefore the practices involved are usually old-fashioned
use of modern technology is minimum and most work is done by household labour
in intensive subsistence agriculture simple tools and huge labour are used by a farmer to cultivate a small plot of land
more than one crop is grown annually in favourable conditions
rioe is the major crop
this form of agriculture is seen in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south south-east and east asia
shifting cultivation is a class of primitive subsistence agriculture
in this a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them
the ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown
after some time the land is abandoned and the farmers move to a different place
this type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the amazon basin tropical africa parts of south-east asia and north-east india
it’ is also called “slash and burn” agriculture
nomadic herding refers to the practice in which herdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water
animals usually reared are the yak sheep camel and goats
commercial farming is the practice in which crops are grown exclusively for commercial purpose i
for sale in the market
a large area is cultivated and huge capital is involved unlike subsistence farming
machines are used to a large extent
commercial grain farming is a class of commercial farming
crops like wheat and maize are grown for commercial purpose
the temperate grasslands of north america europe and asia are some common areas where it is seen
mixed farming is another type of commercial farming
the land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock
some areas where it is followed are europe eastern usa argentina south-east australia new zealand and south africa
plantations are a type of commercial farming where only a single crop like tea coffee sugarcane cashew rubber banana or cotton is grown
large amount of labour and capital are required
the produce is processed in the farm itself or nearby factories
rice is the major food crop of the world
it is the staple diet in tropical and sub-tropical parts
its cultivation needs high temperature humidity and rainfall
china and india are the largest producers of rice in the world
in addition it needs moderate temperature and rainfall during growing season and bright sunshine at harvesting
usa is a major producer
jowar bajra and ragi are major millets grown in india
maize requires moderate temperature rainfall good sunshine and well-drained fertile soils
cotton grows best on black and alluvial soils
it needs high temperature light rainfall  frost free days and bright sunshine
jute called the golden fibre is grown in tropical areas
india and bangladesh are leading producers
coffee grows well on hill slopes
brazil is the leading producer
tea is a beverage crop grow on plantations
it needs well-drained loamy soils ad gentle slopes
agricultural development refers to the effort to increase farm production so as to meet growing demand of increasing population
mechanisation a part of agricultural development means using more machines than human labour
a typical indian farm is about 
 hectares in area whereas a typical usa farm is about  hectares
in the usa farmers use very modern methods for agriculture
in india however obsolete methods are used in most parts
mechanisation is not seen much in india as compared to usa
a farmer in india generally works as a “peasant” whereas in the usa he works as a complete businessman
secondary activities activities which are concerned with the processing of natural resources are called secondary activities
tertiary activities activities which fall neither in the primary category nor the secondary category are called tertiary activities
they do not use natural resources directly
agriculture agriculture is the primary activity that involves cultivation of crops fruits vegetables flowers and rearing of livestock
subsistence farming subsistence farming is the form of agriculture practised solely to meet the needs of the farmer’s family the practices involved are usually old- fashioned
intensive subsistence agriculture in intensive subsistence agriculture simple tools and huge labour are used by a farmer to cultivate a small plot of land
the ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown
after some time the land is abandoned and the farmers move to a different place
nomadic herding nomadic herding refers to the practice in which herdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water
commercial farming commercial farming is the practice in which crops are grown exclusively for commercial purpose i
for sale in the market
commercial grain farming it is a class of commercial farming in which crops like wheat and maize are grown for commercial purpose
mixed farming it is a type of commercial farming in which land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock
plantations these are a type of commercial farming where only a single crop like tea coffee sugarcane cashew rubber banana or cotton is grown
food crops crops like rice wheat maize millets are called food crops
fiber crops crops like jute and cotton are called fibre crops
their usage is not as food
beverage crops tea and coffee are called beverage crops
agricultural development agricultural development refers to the effort to increase farm production so as to meet the growing demand of the increasing population
mechanization this refers to the process of using machines more than human labor
industries are classified  on the basis of raw material agro-based industries mineral-based industries marine-based industries forest- based industries
 on the basis of size small scale industries and large scale industries
availability of raw material land water labour power capital transport market and government policies are the important factors that affect the location of industries
iron & steel industries textile industries and information technology industry are the world’s major industries
the product of iron & steel industry is the raw material for the other industries
so it is also called the feeder industry
steel is often called as the backbone of modern industry
the information technology industry deals in the storage processing and distribution of information
secondary activities are those that involve processing of natural resources
manufacturing is a secondary activity
manufacturing refers to changing raw materials to a product i
to a usable form which can be more valuable to people
industry refers to an economic activity that is concerned with production of goods extraction of minerals or provision of services
we classify industries on the basis of raw materials size and ownership
on basis of raw materials industries are agro-based mineral-based marine-based or forest-based
the raw material of agro-based industries consists of plant and animal-based products
some examples are food processing cotton textile industry and leather industry
the raw material used in mineral-based industries consists of mineral ores
the products of mineral-based industries are used in other industries as well
we can understand it better with an example heavy machinery made of iron which is used in most industries actually comes after processing of iron ore in a mineral-based industry
marine-based industries use products obtained from the sea and oceans as raw materials
the seafood industry is one such industry
a forest-based industry uses forest produce as raw material
examples are paper industry and furniture
based on size industries can be classified into small-scale and large-scale industries
cottage or household industries are
the products here are manufactured by hands with less use of capital and technology
investment of capital and use of technology is huge in large-scale industries
on the basis of ownership industries are classified into the private sector state-owned public sector joint sector and cooperative sector
private sector industries are owned by individuals or a group of individuals
public sector industries are owned by the government
joint sector industries are owned and operated by the state and individuals
maruti udyog is an example of such an industry
cooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or suppliers of raw materials workers or both
amul is one such industry
an industrial system like farming process consists of inputs processes and outputs
raw materials labour and cost of land transport power and other infrastructure constitute the inputs
processes include all activities involved in converting the raw material to finished products
the finish products along with the income earned by its trade are outputs
major industrial regions of the world are eastern north america western and central europe eastern europe and eastern asia
such areas are usually located in temperate areas near seaports and coal fields
the iron and steel industry is a mineral-based industry whose products are used as raw material for other industries
inputs in iron and steel industry iron ore coal limestone human labour capital and infrastructure
steel is called the backbone of modern industry
most common objects are made of steel
in india most important steel- producing centres are spread over the states of west bengal jharkhand orissa and chhattisgarh
tata iron and steel company limited tisco was the only one iron and steel plant in india till independence
it is located in jamshedpur
several iron and steel industries were set up after independence
this led to rapid industrial development in india
pittsburgh is an important steel city of usa
the cotton textile industry is one of the oldest industries in the world
india is renowned for producing excellent quality cotton
the first mechanised textile mill in india was established in mumbai in 
rapid expansion of the industry took place owing to the warm moist climate the presence of a port nearby and availability of raw material and labour at cheap cost
ahmedabad is the second largest textile city in india after mumbai
it is referred to as the “manchester of india”
in recent years textile mills here have started getting closed down due to several problems
osaka is the “manchester of japan”
the information technology it sector deals in the storage processing and distribution of information
the major hubs of it industry are silicon valley in usa and bangalore in india
product a product is something obtained from raw materials by certain processes so that it is something usable and of importance
industry industry refers to economic activity that is concerned with the production of goods extraction of minerals or provision of services
agro-based industries these are industries that use plant and animal-based products as raw material
mineral-based industries these are industries that use mineral ores as their raw material
marine-based industries these are industries that use sea and ocean products as their raw material
forest-based industries these are industries that use forest produce as raw material
small-scale industries these are industries that run on little capital and infrastructure
large-scale industries these are industries that run on a large amount of capital and have a big infrastructure
private-sector industries these are industries owned and run by an individual or group of individuals
public-sector industries these are industries owned and run by the government
joint-sector industries these are industries owned and run by the state as well as individuals
cooperative sector industries these are industries owned and operated by producers or suppliers of raw materials
smelting smelting is the process of extracting the minerals from their ores by heating beyond their melting point
refining refining is the process of yielding the highest possible purity of metal obtained from mineral
information technology industry the it industry deals in the storage processing and distribution of information
it is their ability and knowledge which turns them into the resource
the way in which people are spread across the earth’s surface is known as a pattern of population distribution
nearly  percent of the world’s population lives in about % of the land surface
high altitude areas tropical deserts high mountains and areas of equatorial forests are sparsely populated
whereas south and southeast asia europe and northeastern north america are densely populated
the number of people living in a unit area of the earth’s surface is called density of population
topography climate soil water minerals social cultural and economic conditions are the important factors that affect the distribution of the population
change in the number of people during a specific time is known as population change
the important causes of population change are birth rate death rate and migration
the difference between the birth rate and death rate is known as the growth rate of the population
rate of population growth varies across the world
population composition refers to the structure of the population
from population composition we mean the number of males and females age group they belong to education level occupational distribution income level social status etc
a population pyramid also called the age and sex pyramid helps us to understand the composition of population in any country
human beings are the most important resource of a nation
they are significant because had they not utilised their brains the other resources of nature would not have found any utility
in other words human resource is the ultimate resource
the way in which people are spread across the earth’s surface is known as the pattern of population distribution
some areas are very crowded high density while some are less crowded low density
population density depends on the climate conditions and topography of the place like few people live in high latitude areas tropical deserts mountainous terrains and forest areas whereas a large number of people reside in plains
the density of a particular region is calculated by dividing the population of the region by its area
topography favourable climate fertility of soils availability of fresh water minerals are major geographical factors affecting population density of a region
people prefer to live on plains more than mountains or plateaus and they live more in moderate climates than extreme hot or cold
from the agriculture point of view fertile lands are preferred
areas with mineral deposits are more populated
some social factors that boost the density of population in a region are better housing education and health facilities
places with cultural or historical significance are usually populated
employment opportunities are another attraction for large chunks of population
the term population change refers to change in the population with respect to time
the population of the world is never stable the number of births and deaths affect its change
with better health facilities due to development in medical science now the number of deaths is lower than before
birth rate is a statistic that measures the number of live births per  people
death rate is a statistic that measures the number of deaths per  people
when we talk of the population of a particular region country or continent and not the whole world then along with birth and death rate another factor affecting population change is migration
migration refers to the movement of people from one area to another
since births and deaths are natural causes of population change the difference between the birth and death rate is called the natural death rate
people leaving a country are called emigrants and the phenomenon is called emigration
people arriving in a country’are called immigrants and the phenomenon is called immigration
people usually migrate from less developed areas to more developed ones in search for better employment opportunities among other facilities
the pattern of population change is different for different parts of the world
the structure of the population with various respects age like age sex literacy occupations health facilities + economic condition etc is called population composition
a population pyramid is a pictorial way to describe - the population composition
an age-sex pyramid of india is shown in the figure
the size towards the bottom may be used to - estimate the birth rate while the size towards the top to estimate the death rate
the youngsters ages - and senior citizens aged  above are said to fall under the “dependent” group
they are considered to be economically inactive they depend on the working class for their living
the middle age group constitutes the working class
a population pyramid in which the base is broad and the top part is narrow means that although a large amount of births take place not all grow up to be adults and old it means many die before reaching these ages
this indicates a large death rate and kenya shows such a pyramid
this means a high population growth rate
in countries like india the death rate is decreasing so the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups and the size of the pyramid decreases steadily
population the total number of people living in a particular region is said to be the population of that particular region
the pattern of population distribution the way in which people are spread across the earth’s surface is known as the pattern of population distribution
population density the average number of people living in a unit area of a particular region calculated by dividing the total population of the region by the total area of that region is called the population density of that region
population change the change in the population when described over a certain length of time is called population change
birth rate birth rate is a statistic that measures the number of live births per  people
death rate death rate is a statistic that measures the number of deaths per  people
life expectancy life expectancy is the number of years that an average person can expect to live calculated according to existing data for the particular region
migration migration refers to the movement of people from one area to another
natural death rate the difference between the birth and death rate is called a natural death rate
immigrantsimmigration people arriving in a country are called immigrants and the phenomenon is called immigration
population composition the structure of the population with various respects like age sex literacy occupations health facilities economic condition etc is called population composition
population pyramid a population pyramid is a pictorial way to describe the population composition
