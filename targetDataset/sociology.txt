 societies may be simple may be complex
it is natural to human beings
we all are social beings
we cannot survive without society
we human beings cannot attain our goals alone we want society
the society provides us security relationship identity and sense of belonging ness
 society is mandatory not only for mere survival but also for a good life
 society is a continuous process
it is not imposed upon people
it goes on as a natural process
social relations are the base of social structure
society can be understood in its abstract as well as concrete form
 the main characteristics of the society are interdependence cooperation and conflict mutual awareness similarities and differences abstraction in terms of relationship and dynamism in nature
 individual and society are directly related to each other
the individuals live in collective activities not due to compulsion but by necessity
human beings and their societies are inseparable although we all individuals are compliant and rebellion conventional as well as unorthodox submissive and aggressive i
all sort of contradictions and functioning with opposites
 biological ecological psychological and social factors significantly influence all of us
these influences cause variation in individual and with all commonality in cultural factors each individual becomes unique with different physical and psychological attributes
 all human beings are social beings
we all belong to some culture which determines the individual’s economic maintenance system for personality development
the society basically promotes a particular system to everybody in which individual develops different terms of relationship
 in this perspective human society is different from animal society
human beings have its own culture and a dynamic communication system whereas the animal society has no culture and they have no dynamic form of speech
animal  behavior is instructive whereas we are social beings
human society is dynamic and interdependent having common goals and interact among one another whereas animals’ society is static
 sociology is a scientific and comprehensive study of society
 august comte a french philosopher coined the term sociology in  and called it the science of human associations
he is known as the ‘father of sociology’
the contributions of durkheim spencer and max weber is significant to develop sociology as a separate discipline
 sociology is a scientific study but due to its relationship with social life it can neither be specifically defined nor its boundaries can be marked
according to bottomore “sociology is a modern science not a century old
” sociology is a new science
 emile durkheim said that sociology is the study of collective representation
cognitive thinking conative behavioral and affective feeling constitute social facts
these social facts are external dimension of human mind which controls human behavior to maintain the social network
according to durkheim “all that which is a social fact constitutes the subject matter of sociology
”  according to hobhouse “sociology studies the interaction of human minds
”  park and burgese said that sociology is the science to study collective behavior
according to max weber human activities are goal directed which fulfills some objectives
all human beings engage in actions for the realization of given goals
sociology asserts the importance of the community and the comparatively limited possibilities that exist for social change
 it has often been taken up by the social reforms
 in the present form sociology embraces a range of different views concerning both what a social science should comprise and what might be the proper subject matter of sociology in particular
 there are three general conceptions of the object of sociological interest  social ‘structure’ in the sense of patterns of relationships which have an independent existence over and above the individuals or groups that occupy positions in these structures at any particular time e
the positions of nuclear family may remain same from generation to generation
 meaningful social action according to this view there is no such thing as society merely individuals or groups entering into social relationships with each other
it is a social science not a natural science which studies social groups and social relations
it is a categorical science not a normative science because it deals with ‘what is’ instead of ‘who ought to be’
 sociology is a pure science not an applied science
it simply collects the knowledge about human society
it is an abstract science not a concrete science
it simply deals with the design and norms and interested in the fact that despite the differences in their origin and culture people live in a common human society
 sociology is a science of generalization and not specialization
it simply makes generalizations about human groups social actions societies and their structure
sociology is both a rational and empirical science
it draws facts classify them and derive their mutual relationship which are verified with empirical evidence with minimum error and maximum accuracy
it focuses on the emergence of society
it deals with major social units and their dynamics
 there are two main schools of thought to determine the scope of society
 formal school according to this perspective sociology studies the forms of social relations
the propounders ofthis approach are weber simmel vierkandt ward and von wiese
 synthetic school this school mainly emphasizes on the need of social science which studies general conditions of school life
it studies society as a whole
main propounders of this school are durkheim hob house and sorokin
sociology is a comprehensive study of society
it is positively related with other social sciences particularly with economics history psychology and political science
 sociology and history are positively related as both are social sciences and concerned with each other
but sociology is a general science
 history is a special science dealing with events only
it focuses on description of historical events using historical facts
sociology uses scientific methods to derive facts
 sociology analyses the social problems and provides solutions whereas history simply provides description of facts
 sociology is an analytical discipline whereas history is a descriptive discipline
 sociology is concerned with the present and to some extent with future whereas history studies only the past
sociology deals with the similarities in different events whereas history focuses on differences in similar events
it studies the social processes and relationships whereas history is a concrete science which focuses on social events occurred due to social interaction
 sociology and political science are related to each other being social sciences but both have different domains
 sociology is a general science whereas political science is a special science dealing with political aspect of human life
 political science focuses only on one form of human association the ‘state’ but sociology deals with all forms of association
 sociology is considered a broader form of political science
 political science treats human beings with a political perspective whereas sociology explains how the people change as a political animal
 according to barnes “the most significant thing about sociology and political theory is that most of the changes that have taken place in the political theory in the last  years have been suggested and marked out by sociology
”  sociology and social psychology have a positive link
 sociology studies the society while psychology studies the individual in the society
 sociology deals with social processes whereas psychology is the study of mental processes like attention memory learn up etc
 sociology and anthropology are closely related because anthropology is the study of man and its development of human race and sociology studies modem society in which the people live
 anthropology studies culture which is small and static while sociology studies the dynamic and vast culture
 sociology is a comprehensive study of whole society whereas economics studies only the economic part of the society
sociology is an extensive science as it focuses on all the aspects whereas economics mainly deals with economic view point
 sociological approach is collectivistic to deal with people whereas economics has individualistic approach
 sociology is related with social relations in general terms whereas economics being special science focuses only on economic relations
important terms  anthropology the multidisciplinary study and analysis of the origin and characteristics of human beings and their societies customs and beliefs
it is the study of primitive society and studies man and the development of human race
 bourgeoisie the middle class especially regarded as politically conservative and socially self interested
 capitalism an economic system based on private rather than state ownership of businesses factories transport services etc with free competition and profit making
 dialectic the existence or action of opposing social forces
 feminism a belief or movement advocating the cause of women’s rights and opportunities particularly equal rights with men by challenging inequalities between the sexes in society
 gemeinschoft a kind of society in which life intimates a community in which everyone knows every one else and people share a sense of cohesiveness
 gesellschaft a form of society characterized by impersonal relationship individual accomplishment and self-interest
 micro sociology the study of human behavior in context of face to face interaction
 positivism method of scientific inquiry and given emphasis on empirical research rather than introspection method
 praxis practice to find solution of human problems
 society web of social relationship
 values ideal mode of behavior i
what ‘ought to be’ or should be aspect of life
 sociology a recently developed academic discipline based upon the tenet that all animals and human behavior is ultimately dependent upon genetic encoding moulded through evolutionary history by the process of selection
 asa social science sociology does need to have certain agreed upon meanings of social realities and processes it is studying
 sociological concepts help in defining as well as in understanding social realities
it becomes all the more important to discuss sociological terms so as to distinguish what they mean from commonsensical usage which may have varied meanings and connotations
 some of the basic concepts used in sociology are social group a social group is a collection of two or more persons who are continuously interacting and share common interests and a sense of loyalty within a given society
it has the following characteristics  persistent interaction among its members
 a shared sense of belonging amongst its members
 acceptance of common norms and values
 membership of the group may be formal or informal
difference between a social group and other forms of collectivities quasi-groups all forms of human gatherings and collectivities do not constitute a social group
a social group is different from the related concepts of aggregates and social category
aggregates are collection of people who temporarily share the same physical space but do not see themselves as belonging together and do not have sustained or persistent interaction for example a crowd or a number of commuters stuck in a traffic jam
social category it refers to a statistical grouping of people or classification of people on the basis of similar characteristics
for example all men having the same occupation or all girls having a height of  ft
unlike a social group people who make up a social category do not interact with one another
in fact they may not even know of each other’s existence
both aggregates as well as social category are quasi-groups which can sometimes become a social group over time
common identity as a social group
in their classifications they take different criterion into account
primary group and secondary group on basis of sizetype of relationship
it is the most well known classification given by cooley on the basis of size and type of relationship shared among its members
primary group secondary group i primary group is small group of people
i secondary group is relatively large in size
ii it is characterized by intimate face face and emotional relationships
ii it is marked by formal and impersonal relationships iii for example family and peer group iii for example club residents welfare association primary groups are “primary” because they are central in our lives and they play an important role in influencing our lives
very often primary groups are formed within the orbit of secondary groups
for example a group of friends within an office
in-group and out group—not on basis of size but sense of belongingattachment
classification of in-group and out-group has nothing to do with size
in group out group i the group with which an individual identifies himselfherself has a sense of belonging with
i a group to which an individual feels individual has no sense of belonging identification
ii it is a “we-group”
ii it is a “they group”
iii there is a sense of attachment members of in-group
iii there is a sense of indifference and at times may be even hostility towards members of out- group reference group it is that group to which we do not belong but we aspire to be like them and therefore we try to emulate their lifestyles
for example for many indian youths americans or bollywood stars are a reference group
peer group a type of primary group composed of individuals who are either of similar age or who share a common profession
peer groups have a very strong influence on the life of an individual
each status has certain defined rights and duties assigned to it
examples of status—doctor mother teacher etc
status set each individual occupies status in the society
the totality of the status occupied by an individual in the society is called a status set
for example the status set of nimisha is – daughter friend student sister club member etc
prestige status has a certain amount of prestige or social value attached to it
prestige is attached to the status social position rather than to the person occupying it
example prestige of a doctor may be higher than that of a shopkeeper even if the earning of the doctor is lesser than that of the shopkeeper
status is of two types ascribed status and achieved status achieved status ascribed status i it is achieved by an individual on merit and effort i it is assigned to us on the basis of birth biological inheritance parents’ status etc
ii it is based on individual’s choice ii a person does not choose this status
iii it can change qualifications income etc
iii it is difficult to change status v it plays an important role in modern societies eg
class iv it plays an important role in traditional societies
caste role status and role are inter-connected because role is the behavioural aspect of status
it is the expected behaviour associated with a status
for example the status of a student has certain expected behaviour attached to it
however while a status is occupied role is played
socialisation role conflict each individual performs a number of roles in society
role conflict occurs when performance of one role conflicts with that of another
modern working woman very often finds that her role as a professional conflicts with that of a mother and wife
role stereotyping it refers to reinforcing of certain roles
for example the role of breadwinner for the husband and that of homemaker for the wife is often stereotyped in ads and films
people do make efforts to change the role and status even ascribed status assigned to them by society
for example dalits have been opposing the low status assigned to them on the basis of caste
social stratification according to giddens social stratification refers to division of members of a society into different social categories or strata which are ranked into a hierarchy according to their relative power prestige and wealth
according to tumin “social stratification refers to arrangement of society into hierarchies of strata of social categories that command unequal amounts of property power and honour
” social stratification is not an individual fact it is rather a social fact
it has little to do with individual meritabilities and more to do with socially patterned inequalities
major systems of stratification include  caste  class  gender  slavery  estate the privileges or social rewards enjoyed by any individual depends upon his or her caste class gender and position in society
social stratification and natural differences stratification systems have a social and not a biological bases
they are socially created inequalities
social inequality occurs when biological differences are culturally assigned and subjected to prejudices
for example racism and gender based equalities have little to do with biological differences
blacks are not “naturally unfit” for high ranking jobs neither a woman “naturally inferior” in intellectual abilities
another example is that of old age
old age is evaluated differently in different societies
in traditional societies old age is given power and prestige but in modern societies old age is not associated with much respect
social mobility it refers to the movement of individuals and groups between different socio-economic positions
there is limited social mobilityif at all
individual position in the society depends on achieved status
individual position is based on ascribed status
it is prominent in modem societies 
it is prominent in traditional societies 
example – caste slavery class as a system of stratification  class refers to a group based on sharing of similar economic resources that is wealth income or property
for example trade unions are formed by factory workers in an industrial society
 they share similar lifestyles
 they would also share similar life chances as they have similar kinds of access to health education etc
features of class  as opposed to caste system class does not have any religious or legal sanction
 it is an open system of stratification
social mobility is relatively easy
 membership of class is primarily based on achieved status
caste as a system of stratification  caste refers to inequalities in terms of social honourprestige
 castes are ascriptive groups membership to which is determined by birth
 each caste is ranked as higher or lower as compared to the others in the social hierarchy
it is an institutional characteristic of hindu society but it has spread to other non-hindu communities too such as the muslims christians and sikhs
although it was very important in traditional india it holds its way in modern india too in political as well as social life
the caste system stood for different things in different time periods
in facts it is believed that the caste system originated in the varna system of the rig vedic society
in its earliest phase the late vedic period between - bc the caste system was actually the varna system
varna system varna literally means “colour”
the varna system divided the hindu society into four categories on the basis of occupation and colour
 brahmins-priests  kshatriyas-warriors and kings  vaishyas-traders  shudras-service castes like artisans peasants etc
the so called “untouchables” or the panchamas – the fifth category – were outside the varna scheme
initially these divisions were not very rigid they represented mere occupational division
therefore mobility across categories was possible
for example vishwamitra a kshatriya became a brahmin through achievements
it is also believed by historians that the varna system initially represented the division between the aryans and the dravidians
in the post vedic period  the number of sub-divisions within each varna increased due to growth in trade and increasing specialization of labour
consequently new sub-groups emerged within the varna scheme
 caste became rigid i
 it came to be defined on birth
 each varna and its sub-divisions was ranked hierarchically with strict rules governing their life and relations between different castes
 the first three varnas became the “twice born” castes
 the rigid and hierarchical division of society got religious justification throughthe ancient religious texts like the dharmashastras as well as the manusmritis
these texts set out caste rules unequal duties of the four varnas and their sub-divisions
in fact the religious notions of karma and dharma strengthened the caste system
it was believed that the “most pure” brahmins are close to sacred and therefore are superior to all others
the “untouchables” are the “most polluting” and therefore the most inferior
even the mere touch of the brahmin was considered to be pure while everything related to the so-called untouchables’ touch shadow and occupation – was “impure”
features of caste it is important to note that the above-mentioned features are only the prescribed rules found in ancient texts
we have no firm evidence telling us the way
these rules actually or empirically determined the life of different castes
 caste is ascribed caste is determined by birth
 a person is bom into the caste of one’s parents
caste is not a matter of choice
one can not change one’s caste or leave it
 caste is endogamous i
 marriage is restricted to members of the group
 strict rules about food and food sharing caste membership involves rules about food and food sharing what kind of foods may or may not be eaten is prescribed and whom one may share food with is also prescribed
 hierarchy of rank and status all castes are arranged in a hierarchy of rank and status while the hierarchical position of many castes may vary from region to region
traditionally linked to occupation a person born into a caste could only practice the occupation associated with that caste
so occupations were hereditary under caste system
varna and jati sociological studies of villages in s-s revealed that caste as it actually functions at local level is different from the varna scheme
varna jati a broad pan-indian aggregative are actually existing hierarchies at classification and is uniform throughout level but varies from region to region
in india there are only four varnas —a complex division in each area
there are actually hundreds of castes and sub-castes in contemporary indian villages
studies show that the caste system in contemporary india has two main aspects 
ritual aspect it is based on ideas of purity
it is derived from religious texts
secular aspect it takes both the economic and political aspects into account
therefore caste position in local hierarchies depends on a number of factors
pork eating or non-pork eating  occupation  land holding
at local level very often intermediate and lower level castes try to rise up in the caste hierarchy through the process of sanskritisation
sanskritisation  concept of sanskritisation was introduced by mr
 it refers to the process by which a “low” hindu caste or tribe tries to achieve upward mobility in the local hierarchy by emulating the customs rituals and way of life of the “twice born castes”
for example giving up liquor taking up vegetarianism etc
dominant caste dominant caste is a term introduced by m
srinivas to understand the process of change in rural india
dominant castes are those intermediate castes dominant castes need not be brahmins
in parts of punjab u
and haryana non-brahmin castes are dominant castes that exercise domination at local or regional level is due to the presence of following characteristics  economic power they own large amount of cultivable land
a large number of them managed to get land rights after the land reforms
they therefore dominate the agrarian economy
also they have greater access to urban sources of income western education and jobs in govt and administration
 political power dominant castes are numerically preponderant
this leads to dominance in regional politics
examples of dominant castes yadavs of bihar and u
 reddys of andhra pradesh jats of punjab and haryana
individuals are expected to discharge their roles and perform functions accordingly
in order to exist and progress society has to exercise a certain control over its members
such controls are termed as social control
bernard “social control is a process by which stimuli are brought to bear effectively upon some person or group of persons thus producing responses that function in adjustment to the group
 the influence is exercised by society it means that the group is better able to exercise influence over the individual than any single individual
the group may be the family the church the state the club the school the trade union etc
the effectiveness of influence however depends upon variable factors
however sometimes the influences of the family may be vice-versa —the influence of the clan may be more effective than that of the church
the influence is exercised for promoting the welfare of the group
as a whole social control is exercised with some specific end in view
the end is always the others in the group thus an outing to the welfare of the whole group
the individual is made conscious of the other existence and their interest
thus it is required to promote the interest of all
need for social control social control is essential for the existence of society
every individual has a separate personality
no two persons are alike in their nature ideas interests habits and attitudes
there is so much difference in the ways of living of the people that at every moment there is a possibility of clash between them
therefore social control is necessary to protect the interests of all the people living in society
to develop cooperative views with the help of social control individuals are able to come in contact with each other according to their interests habits position and status
thus they develop the cooperative nature which is the basic element for the development of society
to provide social sanction social control provides social sanction and social ways of behaviour
there are many norms and customs in every society
every individual has to follow them
if an individual violates the social norms he is compelled by the social control to observe them
the above reasons show the need for social control
in modem society the need is greater
means and agencies of social control the means by which individuals are compelled to conform to the usages and life values of the group are numerous
the most important ones are custom law public opinion religion morality social suggestion and norms
custom and laws custom law and fashion play an important role in bringing about social control out of them custom is an important means of controlling social behaviour and its importance in society cannot be minimised
they are very powerful and regulate social life
they are essential to the life of a society and are very dominant specially among illiterate people
they preserve our culture and transmit it to the succeeding generation
they bring people together and develop social relations among them
” characteristics of custom  custom is a social phenomena
 custom is socially recognized
 custom has great social significance
 custom maintains social order
 custom has an external sanction
law in primitive society the norms and customs were sufficient to control the individual behaviour since there was an almost unquestioned compliance with them but in modern civilized societies custom tends to lose their hold with the result that laws are enacted by the state to control the individual
sommer stated that laws’are actually codified customs and mores
definition according to macaiver and page “law is the body of rules which are recognised interpreted and applied to a particular situation by the courts of the state
” characteristics of law  laws are the general conditions of human activity prescribed by the state for its members
 it is a product of conscious and thorough planning and a deliberate formulation
 law is definite clear and precise
 they are equal to all without exception in identical circumstances
 the violation of law is followed by penalties determined by the authorities of the state
factors of social change there are numerous factors that bring about social change
nature as if to prove its might has jnany a time shown its devastating power
human history is full of examples where flourishing civilizations were wiped out by natural calamities e
civilization of mohen-jo- daro and harappa are said to have been lost as a result of an earthquake
to a large extent the geographic conditions include the kind of clothes the people wear food they eat the language they speak etc
however earthquakes floods storms and other natural events are known to change the social structure suddenly
important terms  social groups a number of individuals defined by formal or informal criteria of membership who share a feeling of unity or are bound together in relatively stable patterns of interaction are called social groups
 social system a system in any structured or patterned relationship between any number of elements where the system forms a whole or unity
 social trend a notable pattern of change displayed by a social indicator or index
 socialization a process by which we learn to become members of society by internalizing the norms and values of society also by learning to perform our social roles
 social order explanation of social order of how and why societies where are the control concern of sociology
 social fact ways of thinking feeling and acting that are experienced by individuals as external and constraining and that are general throughout a social group
 social role social expectations attached to particular social positions and analyses the working of such expectations
 ritual an often repeated pattern of behavior which is performed at appropriate time
 social status it refers to the position that a person occupies in the social structure
it may be ascribed or achieved
 identity distinctive characteristics of a person or character of a group which relate to why they are and what is meaningful to them
 sanctions a mode of reward or punishment that reinforces socially expected forms of behavior
 norms written or unwritten rules of behavior which reflects cultural values
in roman law the word denoted the group of producers and slaves and other servants as well as the members connected by common descent or marriage
 according to burgess and locke “a group of persons united by ties of marriage blood or adoption constituting a single household interacting and inter-communicating with each other in their respective social rites of husband and wife mother and father son and daughter brother and sister creating a common culture
” characteristics of a family  a mating relationship a family comes into existence when a man and a woman establish a mating relation between them
 a form of marriage a family requires a home a householder for its living
without a dwelling place the task of child bearing and child rearing cannot be adequately performed
 a system of nomenclature every family is known by a name and has its own system of reckoning descent
descent may be reckoned through the male line or through the female line
usually the wife goes and joins her husband’s family in a patriarchal system and vice- versa in a matriarchal system
the head of the family carries on a certain profession and earns money to maintain the family
thus it can be said that family is a biological unit employing institutionalised sex relationship between husband and wife
it is based on the fact of production and nurture of the child is its important function
it is a universal institution found in every era and in every society
functions of family according to oghbum and nimkoff the functions of family can be divided into the following categories  affectional functions  economic functions  recreational functions  protective functions  religious functions  educational functions according to read the functions of the family are  race perpetuation  socialization  regulation and satisfaction of the sex needs  economic function according to maciver and page the functions of the family can be divided into two categories 
essential functions  satisfaction of sex needs this is the first essential function which the family performs
satisfaction of sex instincts brings the desire of life from the partnership among male and female
the modem family satisfies this instinct to a much greater degree than the traditional family
in the earlier traditional families the sexual act was almost always combined with reproduction and the fear of pregnancy and as a result prevented satisfaction
 production and rearing of children the inevitable result of a sexual union is procreation
the task of race perpetuation has always been an important function of the family
it is an institution par excellence for the production and rearing of children
the function of child rearing is better performed today than in the past because now more skill and knowledge are devoted to the care of the unborn and the newborn child
 provision of a home the desire for home is a powerful incentive for a man and a woman to marriage
man after the hard toil of the day returns home where in the midst of his wife and children he sheds off his fatigue
though in modem times there are many hotels and clubs which also provide recreation to man but the joy a man gets within the congenial circle of his wife parents and children stands far above the momentary pleasure which is provided by clubs and hotels
inspite of these other recreative agencies the home is still the heaven and sanctuary where its members find comfort and affection
non-essential functions the non- essential functions of a family are the following
 economic the family serves as an economic unit
in the pre-industrial tribal and agrarian societies unit of production is the family
all members of the family equally contribute to the family occupation such as cultivation craft cottage-industry cattle-rearing etc
the family provides economic security to its members and looks after their primary needs such as food security clothing shelter and also nurses them in unfavourable conditions
 religious family is a centre for the religious learning as the children learn from their parents various religious virtues
the religious and moral training of children have always been bound with the home
though formal religious education starts in the earliest years of schoolingthe family still furnishes the matrix of religious idea attitudes and practices
it is in the family that the basic notions of god morality and salvation are acquired during childhood
 education the child learns the first letter under the guidance of the parents
the joint family was the center for vocational education as the children from the early childhood were associated with family tasks
the modem family has delegated the task of vocational education to technical institutes and colleges
 social the family is an important unit of society
it imparts learning to the individual in those subjects that can make him become an ideal member of society
family carries out socialization of the individual
it also keeps the social heritage intact and hands it over to the generations to come
it is also an agency of social control
the family norms control the conduct of the individual
the members get love sympathy and emotional support in the family
classification of family sociologists have classified family on the following basis  size  residence  ancestors  power and authority  marriage  chronology  social ecology on the basis of size they were divided into  nuclear family where a husband and wife and their biological children live together it is a nuclear family
the compulsion of living separately in modem industrial environment has fastened the growth of these families
 joint family such families include many units of families living together i
they all live under one roof share a common kitchen have a common economic source
 extended family in this type of family there may seem to be small independent units structurally but functionally they work as one big family sharing a common descent
 traditional occupations factors responsible for disintegration of joint family  industrialization  extension of communication and transport  decline in agricultural and village trades  impact of the west  lack of entertainment and recreations  fragmentation of land holdings residence on the basis of residence there are two types of families 
patrilocal in these families the bride resides with her husband’s family after marriage
majority of families in the world belong to this type
matrilocal in these families the bridegroom resides with the family of his wife after marriage
this system is prevalent in the khasi garo and jaintia tribes of meghalaya
ancestors on the basis of ancestors there are two types of family 
patrilineal in such families the ancestors are men
most of the families in the world belong to the patrilineal system
lineage and succession are determined on the basis of the father
matrilineal in these families the ancestors are women
the lineage and succession are determined on the basis of the mother
power and authority on the basis of power and authority the families are divided into two types  patriarchal in this type of family the father is the head of the family and the familial power and authority rest in father
 matriarchal in these families the familial authority lies with the mother and she is the head of the family
one spouse to each individual
polygamous in this for every individual more than one spouse is allowed
 polygynous in this a man has more than one wife e
 polyandrous in this a woman has more than one husband e
chronology in this there are three types of families 
modem families social ecology on the basis of this there are two families  rural family  urban family marriage  marriage is an institution which admits men and women to family life
it is a stable relationship in which a man and a woman are socially committed to have children and the right to have children implying the rights to sexual relations
 definition according to haston and hanks “marriage is the approved social pattern whereby two or more persons of opposite sex establish a family”
 according to nuntberg “marriage consists of the rules and regulations which define the rights duties and privileges of husband and wife
” characteristics of marriage  marriage is a specific relationship between two individuals of the opposite sex and it is based on mutual rights and obligations
 as a system of rules marriage is an institution
the structure of family is built by the mutual relationships of the individuals
 marriage regulates sex relationship
 procreation bringing up children familial love economic co-operation are other necessary elements of marriage
 society institutionally recognizes sexual gratification through marriage
thus marriage renders sexual gratification patterns based on law
 the couples fulfil their mutual obligations on the basis of customs or rules accepted by law
 validity is given to procreation by marriage
its aim is to form the family bring up children and educate them
 all societies have their own customs and systems of marriage
in almost all societies marriage and religious activities are connected with each other
 there are certain symbols of marriage such as rings special clothes special sings in front of the house vermilion etc
problems related to marriage various forms customs and conventions of marriage are prevalent in india based on the religion caste tribe region etc
certain problems are common and concerned with the majority of indian population
following are the three most striking problems  child marriage in the early times children of very small ages were married
the causes for this were many but some have been endogamyreligious conservatism joint families sati system dowry system etc
the hindu marriage act had fixed the marriageable age for a girl at  years and that for a boy at  years
now the situation has improved in urban areas and semi-industrial areas
but it is almost the same in rural areas
 widow remarriage it was prohibited by the hindus as it was consideration against the departed soul of the husband
widow remarriage is actually not harmful from any angle
it is ethically justified and healthy
it also gives fundamental rights to the young women who have been widowed disowned by their husbands in the prime of their age
most of the social reformers fought for widow remarriage
notable among them were ishwar chandra vidyasager whose effort saw the enactment of the hindus-widow remarriage act in 
this act legalised the remarriage of hindu widows
 dowry the dictionary defines dowry as “the money goods or estates which a woman brings to her husband in marriage”
therefore dowry refers to the property and amount of money one receives in marriage by the groom’s family
the chief evil of this system lies in the compulsion that is employed to extract these things from the bride’s family much against their capacity willingness and desire
ill-fated brides face a lot of atrocities at the hands of their greedy in-laws
dowry is inhuman arbitrary and anti- social
therefore it must be fought from all angles
the efforts of the conscientious people of the society reformers and women’s liberation groups have led to the forming of anti- dowry law

kinship definition according to murdock “every adult in every human society is generally related to two nuclear families
the first of these is the family in which he is born and which includes his parents brothers and sisters
the second type of family is that which the individual sets up through marriage and which includes husband wife and their children
the relationship formed by both these types of family ancestors and successors are called kinship
” basis of kinship according to harry m
johnson kinship has six important bases  sex the terms “brother” and “sister” indicate not only the biological relations but also indicate the sex of the blood relation
 generation the terms “father” and “son” indicate two generations on one hand and close blood relation on the other
 closeness the relationship with the son-in- law and father’s sister’s husband is based only on closeness and not on any blood relationship
these relationships are almost as close as the blood relationship if not closer
 blood relation the kinship based on blood relations is divided into lineage such as grandfather father son grandson etc
 binding thread the binding thread of certain relations is close e
the relationship of a father-in -law is based on the binding thread either of the husband or that of the wife
importance of kinship relations kinship relations have an important place in the social structure

in kinship system the behavioural patterns between two relations are determined by certain rules which are called kinship usage
few of them are as follows  avoidance usage in some relations a safe distance should be maintained between close relatives e
 joking relationship the objective of this is development of close relationship e
 teknonymy in order to talk to one person to another person sign is used as a medium

 it is shared cannot be possessed by an individual in isolation and transmitted amongst the members of a society
it binds the members of a society
it makes each society and group unique or distinct
animal society human society majority of behaviour is instinctive
society distinct and unique major components of culture two types 
non-material cognitive and normative 
material non-material culture it refers to the abstract or intangible elements of culture such as the ways of thinking and patterns of behaviour
it includes the normative and cognitive dimensions of culture
a normative this dimension includes social rules and social expectations i
the norms and values of a society
norms are socially approved guidelines which direct behaviours of members of a society or a social group
in other words they are the social expectations of proper behaviour
norms usually vary across societies and even within the same society across different social groups
a social norm is not necessarily actual behaviour
‘unwritten rules’ most of human actions is norm- governed
there are different types of norms depending on how strict they are
 folkways it refers to traditional customary ways of thinking feeling and behaving
most people conform to folk ways out of habit
they are the lesser order of norms as they are not as strictly enforced as mores or laws
 mores mores are higher order norms linked to the core values of a group
they are considered vital for the group and are expressed as ‘must’ or ‘must not’ behaviour
they are more strictly enforced as compared to folk ways
violations of these are not taken lightly
eg behaving in a decent manner when you go out not eating non-veg when visiting religious places maintaining silence in hospitals
 laws most formal definition of acceptable behavior
they are the formal standardized expressions of norms
laws are codified norms and have been given a sanction
usually those norms are qualified as laws about which society feels strongly about
laws may be based on customs but they are different from customs because  they are upheld by the authority of the state implied to all those accepting the authority of state
 they are backed by penal sanctions
laws are enforced by the courts
in a few cases where laws are contrary to the folkways and mores the enforcement of law becomes difficult
they are the underlined principles guided by choices and actions
 any action contrary to cherished values is condemned
differences between norms and values norms values norms are guidelines to actions which apply to specific situations
more general guidelines a number of specific norms are a reflection of single value
 like a dress code for a function is a norm e
 respecting elders norms under this norm
in indian society there is a value of respect for seniors and from that a number of norms are derived regarding expected behaviour towards seniors such as offering seats to elders touching their feet or greeting them not addressing by first names
importance of norms and values  shared values and norms bring commonality in the outlook between members of society binding them together
 it makes social life orderly and predictable
 without norms we would never know whether to shake hands with a new acquaintance or give them an affectionate push
 norms are essential because they regulate the behaviour of numbers of society or group
without norms there would be chaos and disorder
b cognitive dimension the cognitive dimension of culture refers to ideas which include beliefs knowledge myths superstitions etc
 in literate society ideas are transcribed in books and documents
 but in non-literate societies ideas are in the form of legends and myths which are committed to memory and transmitted orally
 in the contemporary world ideas are also reflected in audio-visual media ads films material aspect of culture it refers to the tangible concrete products that members of society possess and make use of c
- machines buildings jewellery modes of transportation technological gadgets
however material or technological dimensions change faster than non-material aspects values and norms are slower to change
this gives rise to “cultural lag” or a situation whereby non¬material dimensions are unable to match the advances of technology material dimension 
ethnocentrism and cosmopolitism  ethnocentricism—it refers to tendency to devalue others disrespect of diversity looking through and evaluating other cultures through our own cultural lens
it is the application of one’s own cultural values in evaluating the behaviour and beliefs of people from other cultures
it implies devaluing others by looking at them through your cultural lens
ethnocentrism is not open in diversity
 cosmopolitanism it is exactly the opposite of ethnocentrism
it accommodates other cultures’ and their beliefs
cultural changes  external changes in environment colonialism revolutions media
 internal evolution both internal and external changes influence social change that is totally internal
socialisation socialisation is a process by which a person learns to behave in an acceptable manner within the society or group
it refers to the way by which the values and norms of the society or group become a part of the individual’s own way of thinking and feeling
this process is referred to as socialisation and through this the individual becomes a part of the given culture
for society to operate smoothly individuals must be socialised into institutionalised patterns of behaviour values and norms
according to gillin and gillin “by the term socialisation we mean a process by which an individual develops into a functioning member of the group according to its standards conforming to its mode observing its traditions and adjusting himself to the social situations
” according to bogardus “socialization is the process of working together of developing group responsibility of being guided by the welfare means of others
” characteristics of socialization  process of learning socialization is a matter of learning and not of biological inheritance
in the socialization process the individual learns the folkways mores sanctions and other patterns of culture as well as skills ranging from language to manual dexterity
 process of cultural assimilation an individual not only learns the folkways mores sanctions norms and values but he imbibes and assimilates the culture of his society
 process of becoming a functional member of society socialization consists of teaching the person the culture which we must acquire and share
it makes him a participating member in the society and in various groups
 process of cultural transmission socialization is a process through which society transmits the cultural heritage from one generation to another
process of socialization the process of socialization is operated not only in childhood but throughout the life
it is a process which begins at birth and continues till the death of the individual
johnson there are four stages of socialization  oral stage a child is born with some inborn physical and mental capacities
the mother is the first of the parents who begins the process of socialization
it is from her that the earliest social stimuli to which a child is subjected to learn
he responds to the stimuli by imitating them
generally this stage continues till about one and a half years
 anal stage this stage starts from one and a half year and continues till three years
in this stage the main source of socialization of the child is the family
in the family he starts to learn many things like speaking walking eating etc
he also leams toilet training and starts recognizing family relations
 latency stage generally this stage continues from - yrs to - yrs
the child requires something from his equals which he cannot get from a person in authority
from them he acquires the co-operative mentality and some of the informal aspects of culture like folkways praises facts secrets forbidden knowledge etc
 adolescent stage this is the most important stage of socialization
it starts from  - yrs till - yrs
during this stage the individual is more attracted towards the classmates and friends
he gets interested more into recreation fashion clubs sports etc
factors of the process of socialization there are four factors of the process of learning
these are  imitation it is copying by an individual the actions of another
this may be conscious or unconscious spontaneous or deliberate perceptual or ideation
imitation is the main factor in the process of socialization of a child
language and pronunciation are also required by the child
suggestion influences not only behavior with others but also one’s own private and individual behavior
propaganda and advertising are based on the fundamental principles of suggestion
 identification in the early years the child cannot make any distinction between his self
most of his actions are random
as he grows in age he comes to know about the nature of things which satisfy his needs
such things become the object of his identification
the spread and area of identification increase with the advancement in age
through identification he becomes sociable
 language it is the medium of social interactions
it is the means of cultural transmissions
at first the child utters some random syllables which have no meaning but gradually he comes to learn his mother tongue
the mother tongue moulds the personality of the individual from infancy
importance of socialization  it makes transmission of culture possible over generations
 it helps individuals to perform their social roles
 it transforms individuals from a biological being to a social person
phases of socialization there are two broad phases  primary phase it occurs from infant to late childhood
during this stage family is the most important agency of socialization
the child learns the language and the basic behavior pattern during this phase which forms a foundation for later learning
 secondary phase it extends from late childhood to maturity
during this phase other agents of socialization also play a role e
 peer group school media etc
 adult socialization socialization however is a lifelong process
individuals throughout their lives are learning new roles associated with different stages of life which extend even beyond the stage of attaining maturity
thus one can talk about adult socialization
it takes place when individuals enter roles in which primary and secondary socialization has not prepared them fully
as an individual enters a new life and a new group heshe learns the roles associated with the new status
agencies of socialization include family peer group mass media etc
 little tradition it consists of the cultural traits or traditions which are oral in nature
it operates at the village level
 great tradition the cultural traits or traditions which are generally written make great traditions
such kind of cultural traditions is popular among the elites of a society who are educated and learned
 estates system it was a system of ranking in feudul europe
occupation of the people was the base of this system
the nobility clergy and the third state were the three estates of this system
the third estates generally consisted of chiefly professional and idle class people
each class had his own representative but the peasants and labourers did have regret to hope
 sub-culture a group of people within a large culture represents sub-culture
they borrow from or often distant exaggerate or invent the symbols values and beliefs of the people
 social roles social roles signify rights and responsibilities associated with a person’s social position or status
 self image the image of a person expressed in the eyes of others
 cultural evolution it is a theory of culture
according to this theory just like natural species culture also evolves through variation and natural selection
 cognitive aspect of culture it refers to how we learn to process what we hear so as to give it a proper meaning
 normative aspect of culture it refers to rules of conduct like not opening other people’s letters performing rituals at death
 acculturation it comprehends those phenomena which result when groups of individuals having different cultures come into continuous first-hand contact with subsequent changes in the original cultural pattern of either or both of groups
 socialization it means the process of inducting the individual into the social and cultural world of making him a participant member in the society and its various groups and inducing him to accept the norms and values of that society
 conformity it is action that is oriented to a social norm or norms and falls within the bank of behaviour permitted by the norm
 “the social looking glass is the group or society in which persons imagine how others see them
 the structure of anything consists of the relatively stable interrelationship among its parts moreover the term ‘part’ itself implies a certain degree of stability
 there are underlying patterns and regularities in how people behave in the relationship they have with one another
 social structures are made up of human actions and relationships
 what makes the pattern of structure in the society is its repetition across period of time and distance of space
this is the reason the ideas of social reproduction and social structure are closely related to each other in sociological analysis e
in a school the admission procedure code of conduct annual functions daily assemblies school uniform and school anthems are followed and repeated over the years and become institutions
 human beings do bring changes to reproduce the structure by introducing changes
 they cooperate as well as compete with each other often viciously and ruthlessly
 two major themes explain the pattern of human behavior related to cooperation as well as conflict
 emile durkheim emphasizes that society is primary over the individual person
society is far more than the sum of individual acts it has a ‘firmness’ or ‘solidity’ comparable to structures in the material environment
 other social thinkers like karl marx emphasizes the constraints of social structure but at the same time emphasizes on human creativity or agency to both reproduce and change social structure
 in short social structure refers to relatively stable social units and patterned relationships
these are special sequence of interrelations of various units
 social structure manifests the external form of society which is visible comparatively permanent and abstract
 social structure involves four elements i
 it is a system of society on the basis of which individuals and groups get high or low  the concept of stratification refers to the idea that society is divided into a patterned structure of unequal groups and usually implies that thin structure tends to persist across generalizations
 functions of social stratification are related to various strata
no individual can fulfill all his needs alone
 most evident forms of stratification in modem societies involve class divisions race and caste religion and community tribe and gender
 social stratification is a part of the broader social structure
it is characterized by a certain pattern of inequality
caste system is a form of social stratification which have following features  social and religious disabilities of different groups
 restrictions on food and coexistence
 restrictions of marital relations
 restriction on choice of occupation
basic forms of advantage which privileged groups may enjoy  life chances all those material advantages which improve life of the recipients e
wealth income benefits related to health job security and recreation
 social status prestige or high standing in the society
 political influence dominance of one group on another on the basis of decision making ability of a particular group
the opportunities and resources available to individuals and groups to engage in competitions cooperation and conflict are shaped by social structure and social stratification
ways of understanding social processes in sociology  sociology seeks to explain the processes of cooperation competition and conflict in terms of the actual social structure of society
 conflict perspective emphasises how forms of cooperation changed from one historical society to another
 for instance in simple societies where no surplus was produced there was cooperation among members of the society
but in capitalist society where product was surplus the dominant class controlled it and instead of cooperation conflict and competition emerged on the issue of controlling the surplus
 conflict perspective the conflict perspective emphasises that groups and individuals are placed differently and unequally within the system of production relations
thus the factory owner and the factor worker do cooperate in their every day work but a certain hidden conflict of interests or rested interest can be seen in their relationships
 the conflict perspective focuses on division of society on the basis of caste or class or patriarchy
some groups are disadvantaged and discriminated
 functionalist perspective it emphasises on the ‘system requirements’ of society- certain functional imperatives functional requisites and prerequisites
these refer to the fulfilment of the broadest condition which are necessary for a system’s existence e
 the socialization of new members
 shared system of communication
 methods of assigning roles to individuals
 according to functional perspective cooperation competition and conflict can be seen as universal features of all societies and the relationship among them is often complex and not easily separable
 cooperation refers to the continuous and common effort of two or more than two individuals working together equally and willingly towards a goal
it is different from conflict because conflict is an dissociative social process
 cooperation may be conscious or an unconscious process while conflict is mostly a conscious process
 cooperation is universal and continuous process
it involves sympathy as well as empathy towards others
it is selfless in nature
cooperation is psychological as well as social necessity
 cooperation may entail require conflict and there is a difference between enforcedand voluntary cooperation
this can be understood through the example of daughters’ property right in indian society
if they ask for her right then she is looked upon as greedy and if as a compulsion she leaves her right then it is labelled as cooperation
so cooperative behavior can also be seen as a product of deep conflict in society
 a functionalist often uses the term accommodation to explain such situations
it is basically an effort to compromise and co-exist despite conflict
 accommodation may be defined as that form of social process in which two or more persons or groups interact in order to prevent reduce or eliminate conflict
 cooperation and accommodation are two different processes but both are process of associations
both lead to formation of group life conciseness integration assimilation and harmony in the society
 assimilation refers to a social process through which two or more persons or groups accept and perform each other’s pattern of behavior
 cooperation deals with relationship among persons or groups to attain a common goal whereas accommodation and assimilation represent different stages in the process of cooperation
cooperation and division of labour  concept of cooperation rests on certain assumptions of human behaviour
 cooperation helps in human survival
it makes goal attainment easy
it unites people enhances opportunities to attain knowledge as very helpful in economic domain
 durkheim’s solidarity is fundamental for understanding of cooperation
 the role of division of labour—which implies cooperation—is precisely to fulfill certain needs of society
both are forms of cooperation in society
thus they do not passively adjust and accommodate but also change the natural or social world to which they adjust
 although durkheim and karl marx both emphasis cooperation but they also differ
 for marx cooperation is not voluntary in a society where class exists since their cooperation is not voluntary but has come about naturally
this is very different to a weaver or potter or iron smith who derives feeling of fulfillment and pleasure of creativity with that of a worker involved in a factory whose sole task may be to press a button through out the day
cooperation in such a situation is enforced
form of cohesion togetherness in lifestyle specialization or division of labour age and sex
form of social cohesion based on division of labour and resulting into inter-dependence 
they have togetherness due to similar beliefs sentiments and consciousness e
as they become more specialized they become more dependent upon each other e
garment or car manufacturing company
competition as an idea and practice  like cooperation competition is also universal and natural dissociative social processes
however the sociological explanation is different from naturalistic ones
 in the contemporary period competition is a predominant idea and one cannot imagine a society where competition is not a guiding force
 emile durkheim and karl marx have noted the growth of individualism and competition respectively in modem societies
both developments are intrinsic internal to the way modem capitalist society functions
in capitalist society the stress is on greater efficiency and greater profit maximization
 the ideology of competition is the dominant ideology in capitalism
the logic of this ideology is that the market operates in a manner that ensures greatest efficiency e
competitions ensure that the students with higher marks or best studies get admission in prestigious colleges and get best jobs
 this ideology assumes that individuals compete on an equal basis i
 conflict conflict is a dissociative social process
the term ‘conflict’ implies clash of interest
conflict is the dissociative social process in which individuals or groups seek their ends by directly challenging the antagonist by violence or the threat of violence
it includes all activities in which people contend against one another for any objective
 scarcity of resources in society produces conflict as groups struggle to access to and control over those resources
 the bases of conflict vary
it could be class or caste tribe or gender ethnicity or religious community
 sociologists have drawn attention to fhe fact that conflict changes in nature and form at different stages of development
but conflict has always been part of any society
 social change and greater assertion of democratic rights by disadvantaged and discriminated groups make the conflict more visible
 conflicts are different from competition
competition may be an unconscious process while conflict is mostly a conscious process
the main motive of competition is to achieve the goals while conflicts are mostly for personal goals
 conflict appears as a discord or overt clash only when expressed openly but the absence of movement does not imply the absence of a conflict
 since conflict is often not overtly expressed the subordinate sections e
women or peasants develop different strategies to cope with conflicts and ensure cooperation
in this context sociological research funding that covert conflict and overt cooperation is very true and quite common in the societies
important terms  altruism the principle of acting to benefit others without any selfishness or self-interest
 alienation it refers to the loss of control on the part of workers over the nature of the labour task and over the  products of their labour
 anomie for durkheim a social condition where the names guiding conduct break down leaving individuals without social restraints or guidance
 accommodation form of social process in which two or more persons or groups interact in order to prevent reduce or eliminate
 conflict a dissociative social process in which individuals or groups seek their ends by directly challenging the antagonist by violence or the threat of violence
 capitalism a system of wage-labour and commodity production for sale exchange and profit rather than for the immediate need of the producers
 cooperation associative social process where individuals interact among themselves and work together to attain a common objective
 competition dissociative social process of daring effort to achieve something which is not in abundance to fulfil everybody’s demand
 culture the way of life of its members the collection of ideas and habits which they learn share and transmit from generation to generation
 cultural traits the smallest units of culture are cultural traits
 stratification system of society on the base of which individuals and groups get high or low positions
 race biologically inherited group having a distinctive combinations of physical traits and tend to breed them from generation to generation
 modernity the distinctiveness complexity and dynamism of social processes unleashed during the th and th centuries which mark a distinct break from traditional ways of living
 social constraints groups and societies of which we are past exert a conditioning influence on our behavior
according to durkheim this is distinctive property of ‘social facts’
social change can be defined as transformation in the methods of thinking and working of people
it is basically changes in social structures and social relationships of a society
 social change occurs due to physical social demographic cultural and technological factors
 evolution progress and revolution are various forms of social change
 sudden or accidental changes are called revolution whereas slow and gradual social changes are called revolutions
 social change is a broader concept
it includes all the areas of society like political cultural economic and physical etc
by and large there are five broad sources of social change i
environmental technological economic political and cultural change
 social change can be seen in terms of structural changes
structural change refers to transformation in the structure of society to its institutions or the rules by which these institutions run e
 changes in values and belief can also facilitate change
 physical environment and ecology also play a significant role in the structure of society e
poor economic conditions are inevitable in the geographical regions where natural calamities are common
 technology also alters nature and relationships
it allows us to adopt to the problems posed by nature
for example japan being mostly hilly and cold country developed expertise in electrical and electronic gadgets
 industrial revolution has caused massive social changes in almost all the societies of the world
 use of gun powder paper mode of transport railways and aviation’s have brought tremendous social changes
 the social changes due to technological factors are very fast and complex
 social changes occur differently in rural and urban societies
 rural societies are mostly agriculture based and this lacks technology and specialization
people are more comfortable with traditional knowledge and members of their group instead of experts
 joint family system caste system superstitions homogeneity and illiteracy are very common in rural societies
in such societies social change is particularly very slow
 urban societies are mostly industrialized
there is differentiation and stratification not only on the basis of caste but also class
there are a variety of people and culture in a high density area
 the association and relationship are secondary and time based
 people of different castes religions and regions live together with more tolerance
 urban societies are slightly individualistic and characteristic segregation of groups and functions significantly
 cities are basically commercial hubs
 in such urban societies social changes are drastic and quick
 as social change is inevitable similarly all societies need to have a network of social control
 social control means the active maintenance and reproduction of a particular pattern of social relations and of values and norms
 all societies encourage members spontaneously
they abide by a set of rules and norms or people are compelled in various ways to obey such norms
 for control society needs authority
authority is a person who has inherent power to give reward or punishment to maintain social network
according to weber authority is a legitimate power
the authority is provided to them by the system
 domination and law are another aspects of social control
 domination is a psychological phenomena
dominance exists as a feeling in the personality of the individual
it is a personal trait which ir
ay also be related to a specific situation e
a father has a dominant role in indian family system
 law refers to an explicitly codified norm or rule which is usually in written form
 in social term legitimacy refers to the degree of acceptance that is involved in power relations
 contestation is a broad form of insistent disagreement
competition and conflict are more specific than this
counter cultures among faith is example of this
these are refusal to conform to prevalent social norms
 contestations are manifestation of protest against laws or lawful authorities
 a crime is an act that violates an existing law
basically crime is the breaking of the law
it is directly linked with punishment positively correlated to behavior and causing harm etc
 there are various factors of crime like biological factors economic factors geographical factors socio-cultural and psychological factors
important terms  authority it refers to a person or institution which has inherent power to give reward or punishment
it may be traditional authority legal authority or charismatic authority
according to weber it is legitimate power
 internal social change changes in norms and values
 external social change changes in forms of family marriage caste class kinship marriage etc
 change difference in the form of any condition or existence from its previous form is called change
 cultural lag any imbalance that occurs in the speed of change between two types of culture
 law body of rules which are recognized interpreted and applied to particular situations by the courts of the state
 contestation the broad forms of insistent disagreement
a situation when people tend to protest against to conform to existing social norms
 conformity a type of social influence
it is behavior according to pre-existing group norms
 obedience a type of social influence
it is behavior according to the orders or command of any authority
 compliance a type of social influence
it is behavior according to request made by some one may be an authority
 social sanctions related to reward and punishments that are used to bring about social control
 crime any act of the individual that violates the existing law is considered as crime
 diffusion transmission of some traits of a particular culture to another culture which causes change is known as diffusion
 revolution sudden or accidental change in the structure of society is called revolution
 charismatic authority a leader having great influence on others due to his personality is known as charismatic authority
 rural society a simple community based on agriculture
 village a unit of the rural community where rural life upholds itself and does perform its functions
 there are a few environmental problems that demand attention
 all societies have an ecological basis
the term ‘ecology’ denotes the web of physical and biological systems and processes of which humans are one element
 the ecology of a place is also affected by the interaction between its geography and hydrology
ecology has been modified by human action
what appears to be a natural feature of the environment – aridity or flood for example is often produced by human intervention
deforestation in the upper catchment of a river may make the river more flood-prone
 it is often difficult to distinguish between the natural and human factors in ecological change
 social environment emerges from the interaction between biophysical ecology and human interventions
 for instance the fertile soil of the indo-gangetic floodplain enables intensive agriculture
its high productivity allows dense population settlements and generates enough surpluses to support other non-agricultural activities giving rise to complex hierarchical societies and states
 landless labourers and women will have a different relationship with natural resources than men
 in rural india women are likely to experience resource scarcity more acutely because gathering fuel and fetching water are generally women’s tasks but they do not control these resources
 different relationships between environment and society also reflect different social values and norms as well as knowledge systems
 the multiple cultural meanings of a river – its ecological utilitarian spiritual and aesthetic significance are stripped down to a single set of calculations about profit and loss from the sale of water for an entrepreneur
 there are different perspectives of the environment and its relationship to society
these differences include the of ‘nature-nurture’ debate
 theories and data about environment and society are influenced by the social conditions under which they emerge
thus the notions that women are intrinsically less able than men and the black naturally less able than the white were challenged as ideas of equality became more widespread during the th century’s social and political revolutions
 geology geography botany zoology forestry and hydraulic engineering are among the many disciplines that were created and institutionalized to facilitate the management of natural resources for colonial purposes
major environment problems and risks resource depletion  while fossil fuels and specially petroleum hog the headlines the depletion and destruction of water and land is probably even more rapid
 aquifers which have accumulated water over hundreds and thousands of years are being emptied in a few decades to meet the growing demands of intensive agriculture industry and urban centres
 biodiversity habitats such as forests grasslands and wetlands are the other major resources facing rapid depletion largely due to the expansion of areas under agriculture
 indoor pollution from cooking fires is also a serious source of risk
 water pollution is also a very serious issue affecting surface as well as groundwater
 cities also suffer from noise pollution which has been the subject of court orders in many cities
global warming  the release of particular gases carbon dioxide methane and others creates a ‘greenhouse’ effect by trapping the sun’s heat and not allowing it to dissipate
this has caused a small but significant rise in global temperatures
 global warming is likely to result in greater fluctuations and uncertainty in climates across the world
china and indiaare increasingly significant contributors to world carbon and green house gas emissions
 new techniques of gene-splicing allow scientists to import genes from one species into another introducing new characteristics
 genetic modification may also be done to shorten growing time increasing size and the shelf-life of crops
little is known about the long term effects of genetic modification on those who eat these foods or on ecological systems
natural and man-made environmental disasters  the bhopal disaster of  killed about  people when a toxic gas leaked from the union carbide factory and the tsunami of  killed thousands of people are the most recent examples of man-made and natural environmental disasters
why environmental problems are also social problems  social status and power determine the extent to which people can insulate themselves from environmental crises or overcome it
 a sociological analysis shows how public priorities are set and how they are pursued may not be universally beneficial
securing the public interest may actually serve the interests of politically and economically powerful groups or hurt the interests of the poor and politically weak
important terms  deforestation the loss of forest area due to cutting down of trees andor taking over the land for other purposes usually cultivation
 emissions waste gases given off by human-initiated process usually in the context of industries or vehicles
 ecology the web of physical and biological systems and processes of which the humans are one element
 effluents waste materials in fluid form produced from industrial process
 hydrology the source of water and its flows or the broad structure of water resources in a country or region
 urban community human beings living in the environment of the urban areas
 metropolis when a city is socially and economically linked with its suburbs neighboring towns and rural areas it becomes a metropolis
 primitive city large urban centers of the industrial cities having large population with high density are called primitive cities
 magnet cities cities which attract a large population of rural people for better economic opportunities
 suburb a community situated just on the outskirts of a city having low population density and smaller population
 environment means both biological and geographical conditions
 aquifers natural underground formations in the geology of a region where water gets stored
 mono culture when the plant life in a locality or region is reduced to a single variety
 urban ecology branch of urban sociology that deals with the relationships between man and environment of the urban areas
 three revolutions paved the way for the emergence of sociology the enlightenment or the scientific revolution the french revolution and the industrial revolution
the modem era in europe and the conditions of modernity were brought about by three major processes
these were  the enlightenment or dawning of the age of reason
 the quest for political sovereignty embodied in the french revolution
 the system of mass manufacture inaugurated by the industrial revolution
the enlightenment  the ability to think rationally and critically transformed the individual human being into both the producer and the user of all knowledge the ’knowing subject’
 only persons who could think and reason could be considered as a complete human being
 for reason to become the defining feature of the human world it was necessary to displace nature religion and the divine acts of gods from the central position
 the enlightenment was made possible by and in turn helped to develop attitudes of mind that we refer to today as secular scientific and humanistic
the french revolution  the french revolution  announced the arrival of political sovereignty at the level of individuals as well as nation-states
 the declaration of human rights asserted the equality of all citizens and questioned the legitimacy of privileges inherited by birth
 the peasants most of whom were serfs or bonded labourers tied to landed estates owned by members of the aristocracy were freed of their bonds
 the numerous taxes paid by the peasants to the feudal lords and to the churches were cancelled
 the state had to respect the privacy of the autonomous individual and its laws could not intrude upon the domestic life of the people
 religion and the family became more ‘private’ while education specially schooling became more ‘public’
 the nation-state itself was also redefined as a sovereign entity with a centralized government
 the ideals of the french revolution—liberty equality and fraternity became the watchwords of the modem state
the industrial revolution the foundations of modem industry had two major aspects
the first was the systematic application of science and technology to industrial production particularly the invention of new machines and the harnessing of new sources of power
 changes in the production system also resulted in major changes in social life
the factories set up in urban areas were manned by workers who were uprooted from the rural areas and came to the cities in search of work
 low wages at the factory meant that men women and even children had to work long hours in hazardous circumstances to make out a living
 modem forms of governance with the state assuming control of health sanitation crime control and general ‘development’ created the demand for new kinds of knowledge
 karl marx was from germany but spent most of his intellectually productive years in exile in britain
 marx had studied philosophy but he was not a philosopher
he was a social thinker who advocated an end to oppression and exploitation
 he believed that scientific socialism would achieve this goal
 marx argued that human society had progressed through different stages
these were primitive communism slavery feudalism and capitalism
 capitalist society was marked by an ever intensifying process of alienation operating at several levels
 third a large mass of working people is alienated from the fruits of its labour because workers do not own the products they produce
marx believed that capitalism was nevertheless a necessary and progressive stage of human history because it created the preconditions for an egalitarian future free from both exploitation and poverty
 capitalist society would be transformed by its victims i
the working class who would unite to collectively bring about a revolution to overthrow it and establish a free and equal socialist society
 in order to understand the working of capitalism marx undertook an elaborate study of its political social and specially its economic aspects
 marx’s conception of the economy was based on the notion of a mode of production
 the economic base is primarily economic and includes the productive forces and production relations
 productive forces refer to all the means or factors of production such as land labour technology sources of energy such as electricity coal petroleum and so on
 production relations are also property relations or relationships based on the ownership or control of the means of production
 marx argued that people’s ideas and beliefs originated from the economic system of which they were part
 how human beings earned their livelihood determined how they thought – material life shaped ideas ideas did not shape material life
 marx laid great emphasis on economic structures and processes because he believed that they formed the foundations of every social system throughout human history
 he argued that people who occupy the same position in the social production process will eventually form a class
 as the mode of production – i
 the production technology and the social relations of production changes conflicts develop between different classes which result in struggles
 the capitalist mode of production creates the working class which is a new urban property- less group created by the destruction of the feudal agricultural system
 serfs and small peasants were thrown off their lands and deprived of their earlier sources of livelihood
 a new social group was created consisting of property-less people who were forced to work for their living
this shared location within the production process makes workers into a class
 marx was a leader of class struggle
he believed that class struggle was the major driving force of change in society
 marx and engle presented their views in a clear and concise manner
its opening lines declare ‘the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle’
 the working class lost all the means of production that it owned or had access to in the past
thus in the capitalist social system workers had no choice but to sell their labour for wages in order to survive because they had nothing else
 even when two classes are objectively opposed to each other they do not automatically engage in conflict
for conflict to  occur it is necessary for them to become subjectively conscious of their class interests and identities and therefore also of  their rivals’ interests and identities
 ‘class consciousness’ is developed through political mobilisation where class conflicts occur
such conflicts can lead to the overthrow of a dominant or ruling class or coalition of classes by the previously dominated or subordinated classes – this is called a revolution
 in marx’s theory economic process created contradictions which in turn generated class conflict
social and political processes were also needed to bring about a total transformation in society
 this dominant ideology or way of seeing the world tends to justify the domination of the ruling class and the existing social order
for example dominant ideologies may encourage poor people to believe that they are poor not because they are exploited by the rich but because of fate or because of bad deeds in a previous life and so on
 dominant ideologies are not always successful and they can also be challenged by alternative worldviews or rival ideologies
 according to marx economic processes generally tend to generate class conflicts though it also depends on political and social conditions
in given favourable conditions class conflicts culminate in revolutions
 emile durkheim may be considered as the founder of sociology
he was the first to become a professor of sociology in paris in 
 durkheim was sent to rabbinical school a jewish religious school for his early education
 he entered the ecole normale superieure in 
he broke with his religious orientation and declared himself an agnostic
 his moral upbringing had an enduring influence on his sociological thinking
 the moral codes were the key characteristics of a society that determined the behavior patterns of individuals
 coming from a religious family durkheim cherished the idea of developing a secular understanding of religion
it was in his last book the elementary forms of religious life that he was finally able to fulfill this wish
 for durkheim the social class was to be found in the codes of conduct imposed on individuals by collective agreement
it was evident in the practices of everyday life
 ‘moral facts are phenomena like others they consist of rules of action recognizable by certain distinctive characteristics it must then be possible to observe them describe them classify them and look for certain laws explaining
 the morality appropriate for one society was inappropriate for another
so for durkheim the prevailing social conditions could be deduced from the moral codes
 this made sociology akin to the natural sciences and was in keeping with his larger objective of establishing sociology as a rigorous scientific discipline
the subject matter of sociology – the study of social facts – was different from the other sciences  sociology concerned itself exclusively with what he called the ’emergent’ level i
 the level of complex collective life where social phenomena can emerge
these phenomena are social institutions like religion or the family or social values like friendship or patriotism etc
 social entities like teams political parties street gangs religious communities nations and so on belong to a different level of reality than the level of individuals
it is this ’emergent’ level that sociology studies
 the second defining feature of durkheim’s vision of sociology was like most of the natural sciences
it was to be an empirical discipline  one of durkheim’s most significant achievements is his demonstration that sociology a discipline that dealt with abstract entities like social facts could nevertheless be a science founded on observable empirically verifiable evidence
 social facts are like things
they are external to the individual but constrain their behavior
institutions like law education and religion constitute social facts
 social facts are collective representations which emerge from the association of people
they are not particular to a person but of a general nature independent of the individual
attributes like beliefs feelings or collective practices are its example
division of labour in society  in his first book division of labour in society durkheim demonstrated his method of analysis to explain the evolution of society from the primitive to the modem
 he classified a society by the nature of social solidarity which existed in that society
 mechanical solidarity is founded on the similarity of its individual members and is found in societies with small populations
 it typically involves a collection of different self-sufficient groups where each person within a particular group is engaged in similar activities or functions
 this was because the individual and the community were so tightly integrated that it was feared that any violation of codes of conduct could result in the disintegration of the community
 the laws of modern society are ‘restitutive’ in nature rather than ‘repressive’
this means that in modem societies the law aims to repair or correct the wrong that is being done by a criminal act
 in primitive societies the law sought to punish wrong doers and enforced a sort of collective revenge for their acts
 in modem society the individual was given some autonomy whereas in primitive societies the individual was totally submerged in the collectivity
 individuals have different identities in different contexts
this enables individuals to emerge from the shadow of the community and establish their distinct identity in terms of the functions they perform and the roles they play
 the division of labour in society provides a good preview of durkheim’s enduring concerns
 his objective and secular analysis of the social ties which underline different types of society laid the foundation of sociology as the new science of society
max weber  max weber was one of the leading german social thinkers of his time
 he wrote extensively on many subjects but focused on developing an interpretive sociology of social action and of power and domination
 another major concern of weber was the process of rationalisation in modem society and the relationship of the various religions of the world with this process
 weber argued that the overall objective of the social sciences was to develop an ‘interpretive understanding of social action’
 sociology is a systematic form of ’empathetic understanding’ that is an understanding based not on ‘feeling for’ sympathy but ‘feeling with’ empathy
 weber was among the first to discuss the special and complex kind of ‘objectivity’ that the social sciences had to cultivate
 the social world was founded on subjective human meanings values feelings prejudices ideals and so on
 social sciences inevitably had to deal with these subjective meanings
 in order to capture these meanings and describe them accurately social scientists had to constantly practise ’empathetic understanding’ by putting themselves imaginatively in the place of the people whose actions they were studying
 ‘empathetic understanding’ required the sociologist to faithfully record the subjective meanings and motivations of social actors without allowing hisher own personal beliefs and opinions to influence this process in any way
 weber called this kind of objectivity’value neutrality’
 the sociologist must neutrally record subjective values
 weber recognized that this was very difficult to do because social scientists were also members of society and always had their own subjective beliefs and prejudice
 however they had to practice great self discipline exercise an ‘iron will’ as he puts it in order to remain ‘value neutral’ when describing the values and worldviews of others
 weber suggested another methodological tool for doing sociology—the ‘ideal type’
 an ideal type is a logically consistent model of a social phenomenon that highlights its most significant characteristics
being a conceptual tool designed to help analysis it is not meant to be an exact reproduction of reality
 ideal types may exaggerate some features of phenomenon that are considered to be analytically important and ignore or downplay others
 an ideal type is to be judged by how helpful it is for analysis and understanding not by how accurate or detailed a description it provides
 weber used the ideal type to illustrate three types of authority that he defined as traditional charismatic and rational – legal
 while the source of traditional authority was custom and precedence charismatic authority derived from divine sources or the ‘gift of grace’ and rational-legal demarcation of authority
 rational-legal authority which prevailed in modem times was epitomised in the bureaucracy
 bureaucracy restricted the power of the officials in regard to their responsibilities and did not provide absolute power to them
bureaucratic authority is characterised by these features  functioning of officials  hierarchical ordering of positions  reliance on written document  office management and  conduct in office functioning of officials within the bureaucracy officials have fixed areas of ‘official jurisdiction’ governed by rules laws and administrative regulations
commands are issued by higher authorities for implementation by subordinates in a stable way but the responsibilities of officials are strictly delimited by the authority available to them
hierarchical ordering of positions authority and office are placed on a graded hierarchy where the higher officials supervise the lower ones
conduct in office as official activity demands the full time attention of officials irrespective of herhis delimited hours in office hence an official’s conduct in office is governed by exhaustive rules and regulations
 weber’s characterization of bureaucracy as a modern form of political authority demonstrated how an individual actor was both recognized for herhis skills and training and given responsibilities with the requisite authority to implement them
in this order each person has some power and authority
 its aim is to run the administration of the state
an ideal type of bureaucracy has following features  specified spheres for workers and officials
 hierarchy of official position
 functioning of officers in modem bureaucracy
important terms  alienation a condition in which men are dominated by forces of their own creations which confront them as other powers
it is a process in capitalist society by which human beings are separated from nature other humans their self and their work
according to marx it is a condition of self estrangement
 charismatic authority based on charismatic legitimacy which depends on devotion to the specific and exceptional sanctity heroism or exemplary behavior
 surplus value it refers to the quality of value produced by the worker beyond the necessary labour time
 office a public post or position of impersonal and formal authority with specified powers and responsibilities
 enlightenment a period in th century when philosophers rejected the supremacy of relations doctrines established reason as the means of truth and the human beings as the sole bearer of reason
regulated by explicit mles and regulations
 productive forces all the means or factors of production such as land labour technology
ananthakrishna iyer -  began his career as a clerk moved on to become a school teacher and later a college teacher in cochin state in present day kerala
 in  he was asked by the dewan of cochin to assist with an ethnographic survey of the state
 ananthakrishna iyer was probably the first self-taught anthropologist to receive national and international recognition as a scholar and an academician
 he was invited to lecture at the university of madras and was appointed as reader at the university of calcutta where he helped in setting up the first post-graduate anthropology department in india
 he remained at the university of calcutta from  to 
he had no formal qualification in anthropology
 he was elected president of the ethnology section of the indian science congress
 he was awarded an honorary doctorate by german university during his lecture tour of europeon universities
 the lawyer sarat chandra roy - was another ‘accidental anthropologist’ and pioneer of the discipline in india
 before taking his law degree in calcutta’s ripon college roy had begun practicing law he decided to go to ranchi in  to take up a job as an english teacher at a christian missionary school
 he became the leading authority on the culture and society of the tribal peoples of the chhotanagpur region presently in jharkhand
 roy’s interest in anthropological matters began when he gave up his school job and began practicing law at the ranchi courts eventually being appointed as official interpreter in the court
he travelled extensively among tribal communities and did intensive field work among them
 roy published more than one hundred articles in leading indian and british academic journals in addition to his famous monographs on the oraon the mundas and the kharias
 he founded the journal man in india in  the earliest journal of its kind in india that is still published
ghurye can be considered the founder of institutionalized sociology in india
 he headed india’s very first post-graduate teaching department of sociology at bombay university for thirty-five years
 he founded the indian sociological society as well as its journal sociological bulletin
 ghurye managed to nurture sociology as an increasingly indian discipline
ghurye was first to implement successfully  two of the features
 the active combining of teaching and research within the same institution
 the merger of social anthropology and sociology into a composite discipline
 ghurye wrote on caste race and themes including tribes kinship family and marriage culture civilization and the historic role of cities religion and the sociology of conflict and integration
 ghurye was influenced by diffusionism orientalist scholarship on hindu religion and thought nationalism and the  cultural aspects of hindu identity
 ghurye worked on ‘tribal’ his writings on this subject and specially his debate with verrier elwin which first made him known outside sociology and the academic world
 many british administrator-anthropologists were specially interested in the tribes of india and believed them to be primitive people with a distinctive culture far from the mainstream of hinduism
 they also believed that the innocent and simple tribals would suffer exploitation and cultural degradation through contact with hindu culture and society
 flhurye became the best-known exponent of the nationalist view and insisted on characterizing the tribes of india as ‘backward hindus’ rather than distinct cultural groups
 the ‘protectionists’ believed that assimilation would result in the severe exploitation and cultural extinction of the tribals
 ghurye and the nationalists on the other hand argued that these ill-effects were not specific to tribal cultures but were common to all the backward and downtrodden sections of indian society
ghurye on caste and race  g
ghurye’s academic reputation was built on the basis of his doctoral dissertation at cambridge which was later published as caste and race in india 
 ghurye provides a detailed critique of the then dominant theories about the relationship between race and caste
 herbert risley a british colonial official who was deeply interested in anthropological matters was the main proponent of the dominant view
 this view held that human beings can be divided into distinct and separate races on the basis of their physical characteristics such as the circumference of the skull the length of the nose or the volume size of the cranium or the part of the skull where the brain is located
 risley and others believed that india was a unique ‘laboratory’ for studying the evolution of racial types because caste strictly prohibits intermarriage among different groups and had done so for centuries
 in general the higher castes approximated indo-aryan racial traits while the lower castes seemed to belong to non-aryan aboriginal mongoloid or other racial groups
 risley and others suggested that the lower castes were the aboriginal inhabitants of india
they had been subjugated by an aryan people who had come from elsewhere and settled in india
 ghurye did not disagree with the basic argument put forward by risley but believed it to be only partially correct
he pointed out the problem with using averages alone without considering the variation in the distribution of a particular measurement for a given community
in other parts of india the inter- group differences in the anthropometric measurements were not very large or systematic
 this suggested that in most of india except the indo-gangetic plain different racial groups had been mixing with each other for a very long time
 thus ‘racial purity’ had been preserved due to the prohibition on inter-marriage only in ‘hindustan proper’ north india
in the rest of the country the practice of endogamy marrying only within a particular caste group may have been introduced into groups that were already racially varied
 ghurye is also known for offering a comprehensive definition of caste
his definition emphasises the following features  caste is an institution based on segmental division  this means that society is divided into a number of closed mutually exclusive segments or compartments
each caste is one such compartment
 it is closed because caste is decided by birth – the children bom to parents of a particular caste will always belong to that caste
 there is no way other than birth of acquiring caste membership
in short a person’s caste is decided by birth it can neither be avoided nor changed
caste society is based on hierarchical division  each caste is strictly unequal to other caste that is every caste is either higher or lower than other one
in theory though not in practice no two castes are ever equal
 the institution of caste necessarily involves restrictions on social interaction specially the sharing of food
 there are elaborate rules prescribing what kind of food may be shared between which groups
these rules are governed by ideas of purity and pollution
 caste also involves differential rights and duties for different castes
 these rights and duties pertain not only to religious practices but also extend to the secular world
 caste restricts the choice of occupation which like caste itself is decided by birth and is hereditary
 caste involves strict restrictions on marriage
caste ‘endogamy’ or marriage only within the caste is often accompanied by rules about ’exogamy or whom one may not marry
mukerji on tradition and change  d
mukerji felt very strongly that the distinctive feature of india was its social system and that therefore it was important for each social science to be rooted in this context
mukerji this study of tradition was not oriented only towards the past but also included sensitivity to change
thus tradition was a living tradition maintaining its links with the past but also adapting to the present and thus evolving over time
 he believed that sociologists should learn and be familiar with both ‘high’ and ‘low’ languages and cultures – not only sanskrit persian or arabic but also local dialects
mukerji argued that indian culture and society are not individualistic in the western sense
 indian social system is basically oriented towards groups sect or caste-action not ‘voluntaristic’ individual action
although ‘voluntarism’ was beginning to influence the urban middle classes
mukerji pointed out that the root meaning of the word ‘tradition’ is to transmit
its sanskrit equivalents are either parampara that is succession or aitihya which comes from the same root as itihas or history
 the most commonly cited internal source of change in western societies is the economy but this source has not been as effective in india
believed had been “smoothed and covered by caste traditions” in the indian context where new class relations had not yet emerged very sharply
 he concluded that one of the first tasks for a dynamic indian sociology would be to provide an account of the internal non-economic causes of change
mukerji believed that there were three principles of change recognized in indian traditions namely shruti smriti and anubhava
 the most important principle of change in indian society was generalized anubhava or the collective experience of groups
mukerji emphasized that this was true not only of hindu but also of muslim culture in india
in indian islam the sufis have stressed love and experience rather than holy texts and have been important in bringing about change
mukerji’s views on tradition and change led him to criticise all instances of unthinking borrowing from western intellectual traditions including in such contexts as development planning
tradition was neither to be worshiped nor ignored just as modernity was needed but not to be blindly adopted
desai is one of the rare indian sociologists who was directly involved in politics as a formal member of political parties
 desai was a life-long marxist and became involved in marxist politics during his undergraduate days at baroda though he later resigned from his membership of the communist party of india
 desai joined the bombay department of sociology to study under ghurye
he wrote his doctoral dissertation on the social aspects of indian nationalism and was awarded the degree in 
 his thesis was published in  as the social background of indian nationalism which is probably his best known work
desai on the state in an essay called “the myth of the welfare state” desai provides a detailed critique of this notion and points to it many shortcomings
desai identifies the following unique features of the welfare state   a welfare state is a positive state
this means that unlike the taissez f aire’ of classical liberaly political theory the welfare state does not seek to do only the minimum necessary to maintain law and order
 the welfare state is an interventionist state and actively uses its considerable powers to design and implement social policies for the betterment of society
 the welfare state is a democratic state
democracy was considered an essential condition for the emergence of the welfare state
 formal democratic institutions specially multi-party elections were thought to be a defining feature of the welfare state
 a welfare state involves a mixed economy
a ’mixed economy’ means an economy where both private capitalist enterprises and state or publicly owned enterprises co-exist
 the state sector concentrates on basic goods and social infrastructure while private industry dominates the consumer goods sector
performance of the welfare state can be measured
does welfare state provide employment to all even developed countries are unable to reduce economic inequality and often seem to encourage it
 the so-called welfare states have also been unsuccessful at enabling stable development free from market fluctuations
 the presence of excess economic capacity and high levels of unemployment are yet another failure
 based on these arguments desai concludes that the notion of the welfare state is something of a myth
emphasized the importance of democracy even under communism arguing strongly that political liberties and the rule of law must be upheld in all genuinely socialist states
