carbohydrates proteins fats vitamins and minerals are the components of food
these components of food are necessary for our body and are called nutrients
green plants prepare their own food while humans and animals are directly or indirectly dependent on plants for their food
co and ho by the process of photosynthesis
therefore plants are called autotrophs
ii heterotrophs heteros-other humans and animals do not contain chlorophyll and are dependent on plants for their food in readymade form
the photosynthetic process can occur in other green parts of the plant-like stem but is not enough for meeting all the needs of the plant
they can only be seen under a microscope
the cell has a thin outer boundary called cell membrane a distinct centrally located spherical structure called nucleus and jelly-the substance surrounding the nucleus called cytoplasm
co is taken from the air through the tiny pores present on the surface of leaves called stomata and water is absorbed through the roots of plants from the soil and is transported to leaves by vessels which act like pipes
green plants possess chlorophyll in their leaves which captures the energy of the sunlight
this light energy is used to prepare food starch
during the process oxygen is also released
photosynthesis is the unique process in which solar energy is captured by the leaves and stored in the plants in the form of food
’ products of photosynthesis the food produced by the process of photosynthesis is mainly carbohydrate
it produces glucose as food material which later gets converted into starch
the presence of starch in leaves indicates the occurrence of photosynthesis
therefore it can be said that no life is possible in the absence of photosynthesis
photosynthesis in leaves of various colours in green pants chlorophyll absorbs light energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis
besides some green colour plants like croton maple colocasia etc
 have leaves that are red brown violet colour variegated
these colours are present in large amounts and masks the green colour of chlorophyll in leaves
thus these leaves also perform photosynthesis and synthesise starch in them
synthesis of plant food other than carbohydrates the starch or glucose is the simplest form of carbohydrate synthesised by the plants which is composed of carbon hydrogen and oxygen
sometimes these simplest forms of carbohydrate are utilised to synthesise other food nutrients like fats oils proteins etc
starch or glucose is rich in seeds like wheat rice and various parts of plants like potato tuber
sometimes the starch or glucose is stored in the form of oil in their seeds oilseed e
when the plant nutrient contains carbon hydrogen and oxygen along with nitrogen elements it is called protein
the element nitrogen comes from soil in the form of nitrate by the actions of some bacteria present in soil and forms amino acid which is then converted into proteins
therefore plants also make fats and proteins as their food
other modes of nutrition in plants there are some plants which do not contain chlorophyll in them and thus cannot prepare their own food
these plants obtain their food from other plants or animal i
they are heterotrophic in nature
it takes readymade food from host through special type of roots called sucking roots which penetrate into host plant and suck food material from the host
insectivorous plants there are some plants which can trap insects and digest them for their nutrition
these plants are green in colour but lack nitrogen elements
to overcome this problem these plants eat insects
hence they are called insectivorous plant or carnivorous plants
these have specialised leaves the apex of which forms a lid that can open and close the mouth of pitcher
there are hair inside the pitcher which are used to entangle the insects
when an insect comes in contact of the lid it gets closed and traps the insects
the insect inside the pitcher is digested by digestive juices secreted by the pitcher to obtain nitrogen compounds amino acids from them
pitcher plant sundew venus flytrap and bladderwort
plants which use the saprotrophic mode of nutrition are called saprotrophs e
fungi like mushrooms are non-green plants that grow on the dead and decaying matter for their food
bread moulds fungi and yeast are saprophytic plants
symbiotic plants sometimes two plants of different species live together and help each other in obtaining food and shelter
this association is called symbiosis and such plants are called symbiotic plants
lichen is an association in which algae and a fungus live together
the fungus provides shelter water and minerals to the algae and in return the algae provide food which it prepares by photosynthesis
replenishment of nutrients in soil crops require a lot of nitrogen to make proteins
after the harvest the soil becomes deficient in nitrogen
plants cannot use the nitrogen gas available in the atmosphere directly
rhizobium bacteria live in the root nodules of leguminous plants
these bacteria take nitrogen gas from the atmosphere and convert it into water-soluble nitrogen compounds making it available to the leguminous plants for their growth
in return leguminous plants provide food and shelter to the bacteria as rhizobium cannot prepare its food
they thus have a symbiotic relationship
this association is very important for the farmers as they do not need to add nitrogen fertilisers to the soil in which leguminous plants are grown
the process of taking food by an animal and its utilisation in the body is called animal nutrition
plants can prepare their own food by the process of photosynthesis but animals get their food from plants either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating other animals that eat plants
some animals eat both plants and other animals
animal nutrition includes nutrient requirements mode of intake of food and its utilisation in the body
the components of food such as carbohydrates are complex substances which cannot be utilised by the body
so they are broken down into simpler substances
the process of breakdown of complex components of food into simpler substances is called digestion
there are two methods of digesting food i
physical method including chewing and grinding of food in mouth and chemical method addition of digestive juices to the food by the body itself
different ways of taking food different types of animals show different modes of nutrition
some animals filter tiny food particles and feed upon them while some swollen the animals they prey upon
it has a unique mode of nutrition
it opens the shell of its prey and pops out its stomach through its mouth surrounding the soft body of its prey
the starfish after capturing its prey brings bach its stomach inside its own body
this food is then digested slowly by starfish
digestion in humans the food components pass through a continuous canal and get digested in each compartment
this is called an alimentary canal it is ‘the tract or canal running from mouth to anus of human being where digestion and absorption of food take place
 the process by which the food containing large insoluble substances is broken down into small water-soluble substances is called digestion
there are two methods of digesting food i
physical method including chewing and grinding of food in mouth and chemical method addition of digestive juices to the food by the body itself
 the process by which the digested food passes through the intestinal wall into the bloodstream is called absorption
 the process by which the absorbed food is taken in body cells and used for energy growth and repair is called assimilation
 the process by which the undigested food is removed from the body is called egestion
carbohydrates fats and proteins are large insoluble substances which cannot pass through the walls of our intestine and get absorbed in that form
therefore these substances are broken down into small water- soluble substances
this is done by the process of digestion
the carbohydrates get broken down into simple sugar called glucose while fats in fatty acid and glycerol and proteins get broken down into amino acids during digestion
these simpler compounds are easily absorbed by the walls of small intestine into the blood
human digestive system the system that consists of the digestive tract along with glands is called the digestive system
now let us know what happens to the food in different parts of the digestive tract
mouth and buccal cavity the process of ingestion starts from the mouth or buccal cavity
as we ingest food the salivary glands present in the mouth start its digestion
the teeth present in the buccal cavity cut the food into small pieces by chewing and grinding it
salivary glands secrete a watery liquid saliva
this saliva contains digestive enzymes which help in partial digestion of food starch
the tongue helps in mixing saliva with food
this partially digested food is swallowed by the tongue and passed down to oesophagus or food pipe
teeth the food is cut by the teeth inside the mouth
teeth mechanically break the food into small pieces
these teeth vary in appearance
each tooth is rooted in a separate socket in the gums
 canines these are two large pointed teeth just behind incisors in each jaw for piercing and tearing the food
 premolars these are four two on each side large premolars with the flat surface behind the canines in each jaw for grinding and chewing
 molars in an adult these are six three on each side large molars with the flat surface behind the premolars in each jaw for grinding
milk teeth and permanent teeth in human beings teeth grow twice
the sets of teeth that grow during infancy when one is a small baby are called milh teeth
these are also called as temporary teeth
these teeth get loosen and fall off at the age of - years
when milh teeth fall off a new sets of teeth grow in their place
this second set of teeth is called permanent teeth because these remain till the old age
but if these teeth fall down no new teeth arise on its place
sweets and tooth decay the tooth is covered by white hard outer covering of tooth called enamel below which dentine is present
bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful to us
however if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it
these bacteria breakdown the sugars present from the leftover food and release acids
the acids gradually damage the teeth
this is called tooth decay
therefore tooth decay is defined as the process of rotting of tooth and formation of cavity or holes in it which leads to the toothache
when the holes or cavity reaches to the pulp cavity it causes pain
if these cavities are not treated on time it causes severe toothache and may result in tooth loss
tooth decay can be prevented by adopting the following measures
 one should rinse and clean its teeth thoroughly after every meal
 we should use dental floss which is a special strong thread
it is moved between two teeth to take out trapped food particles
 dirty fingers or unwashed objects must be avoided to put in the  we should avoid the use of sweets chocolates toffees ice-cream be avoided
it is free from the front and can help in mixing saliva with the food swallowing the food talking or speaking and tasting with the help of taste buds for sweet salt sour and bitter food
salivary glands secrete saliva which breaks down starch into sugars
the food pipe or oesophagus it is the tube-like structure which connects the mouth to the stomach and runs along neck and chest
it carries slightly digested food from the mouth to the stomach
food is pushed downward by a wave like movement of the wall of foodpipe as a result of alternate contraction and relaxation
this movement is called peristalsis
the chewed food that enters the oesophagus from mouth and is passed down to stomach is called bolus
sometimes food is not accepted by our stomach and is vomited out because the food moves in the opposite direction i
from stomach to mouth by anti-peristaltic movement in oesophagus
air and food share a common passage in the throat
when we swallow food a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the food into the foodpipe
but if we laugh or talk while eating the windpipe remains open and food particle enters into the windpipe and we experience hiccups cough or choking si characteristic ‘gulping sound’ repeatedly and coughing clears the blockage of windpipe 
the stomach the stomach was first discovered by an american doctor william beaumont in  accidentally in the man named alexis st
it is a thick walled bag-like structure which is present on the left side of the abdomen
its shape is like flattened u and it is the widest part of the alimentary canal
the semi-digested food from oesophagus enters into stomach where further digestion takes place
the churning of food into stomach takes place for three hours
the food is broken down into smaller pieces and forms semi-solid paste
the inner lining of stomach secretes mucus hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes or juices
the function of mucus is to protect the lining of stomach from the action of hydrochloric acid
the secretion of hydrochloric acid makes the medium acidic inside the stomach
it kills the harmful bacteria present in the food and also helps in the digestion of proteins in the stomach
the partially digested food which moves from stomach to the small intestine is called chyme
the small intestine it is highly coiled long tube with length of about 
the small intestine is a narrow tube which receives secretions from the liver and pancreas
the wall of small intestine also secretes digestive juices
the complete digestion of food takes place inside the small intestine and the food components are also absorbed here
the largest gland of the body i
liver is the reddish-brown coloured gland situated in the upper part of the abdomen on the right side
it secretes bile juices which is stored in a sac-like structure called as gall bladder
the bile helps in the digestion of fats
it breaks the fat molecules into tiny droplets so that its further breakdown into simpler compounds becomes easy
the complete digestion of fats is done by pancreatic juice
the pancreas is a large cream coloured gland which is located just below the stomach and secretes pancreatic juices
it breaks down fats into simpler compounds like fatty acid and glycerol carbohydrate into simple sugars and proteins into simpler amino acids
the intestinal juices secreted by the walls of small intestine also help in the digestion of carbohydrate and proteins into simpler and water soluble substance
now the food is said to be digested
this digested food is now absorbed by the walls of small intestine
absorption in the small intestine the blood vessels in the walls of the intestine absorb the digested and water soluble substance to produce energy for growth and development of animals
the inner walls of small intestine have thousands of finger-like outgrowths called villi
these villi help in increasing the surface area of small intestine for the absorption of digested food
villi possess a network of thin and small blood vessels close to its surface
the glucose breaks down into carbon dioxide and water and releases huge amount of energy with the help of oxygen inside the cell
the undigested food material is not absorbed by the small intestine and it passes from here to the large intestine
large intestine it is a 
it is wider and shorter than the small intestine
the undigested semi-solid food is passed from small intestine to large intestine
the large intestine absorbs water and salt from the undigested food
the remaining waste material then passes to the rectum and remains there for some time in the form of semi-solid faeces
this waste faecal matter is then removed through the anus from the body by the process called egestion
diarrhoea it is a condition in which a person passes out watery stools frequently
it is a disease which is caused by an infection food poisoning or indigestion
it usually occurs in children and may be fatal
in this condition there is a loss of water and salts from the body of a person through frequent watery stools
this loss of water from the body of a person through watery stool is called dehydration and it may be fatal under severe conditions
diarrhoea should never be neglected
in order to prevent dehydration the person suffering from diarrhoea should be given a solution of sugar and salt in the clean water for several times in a day
this solution is called oral rehydration solution ors
the ors makes up the loss of water and salt in the body and sugar provides energy which helps in the recovery of disease
the dehydration of body can be prevented during diarrhoea by giving ors solution regularly to the patients
in the mean time the doctors should be called for medicines to cure of diarrhoea
digestion in grass-eating animals the herbivorous animals such as cow buffaloes etc eat grass
these animals quickly swallow the grass and store it in a part of stomach called rumen
the food is not chewed completely
this partially digested food or grass present in the rumen of cow is called cud
this cud is brought back into the mouth of the cow from the rumen into small lumps and animal chews it again
this process is called rumination and animals are called ruminants
when this cud is thoroughly chewed in the mouth of the cow it is swallowed again
this time the chewed cud does not go back to rumen but enter into the other compartments of cow’s stomach and then into the small intestine for complete digestion and absorption of food
the cellulose digesting bacteria are not present in the body of human being therefore human beings and other carnivore cannot digest cellulose present in plant food items
it is a very simple animal and cannot be seen by naked eyes
amoeba has a cell membrane a rounded dense nucleus and many small bubble-like vacuoles in its cytoplasm
these vacuoles are of two types i
food vacuole and contractile vacuole
food vacuole contains food surrounded by water while contractile vacuole contains liquid or water and controls water regulation activity in amoeba
its shape is not fixed i
it constantly changes its shape and position
the body of amoeba has finger- like projections called pseudopodia or false feet
it captures food and helps in locomotion of amoeba
when amoeba senses its food it pushes out pseudopodia around the food particle and engulfs it
the two pseudopodia join around the food particle and trap the food particle with a little water forming vacuole around food thus the food gets trapped
digestive juices present inside the vacuole acts on the food and break it into simpler substances
this digested food is then absorbed and is used for growth maintenance and multiplication of amoeba
the undigested food residue is expelled outside by the vacuole
some examples of fibres are cotton wool silk flax jute nylon polyester and polyacrylic
the fibres are spun into yarn long continuous thread which can then be woven on a loom to make a fabric or cloth
yam is a kind of long twisted thread
yarn is made from fibres by the process of spinning
there are two types of fibres i
natural fibre and man-made fibre nylon rayon
some of our clothes are made from yarn derived from the animal fibre
these are the types of natural fibres as they are obtained from nature
natural fibres are the fibres which are obtained from natural sources like plants and animals
in class vi we have learnt about some fibres obtained from plants
wool and silk fibres are obtained from animals
wool is obtained from the fleece hair of sheep or yak and silk fibres come from cocoons of the silk moth
wool the wool comes from animals like sheep goat yak camel llama and alpaca
the wool yielding animals bear a thick coat of hair on their body
the hair which gives us wool and keeps them warm during the cold winter season
the hair wool on the body of wool-yielding animals trap a lot of air
air spaces between the wool fibres trap air
since the air is a poor conductor of heat
so the air trapped in hair shields the body from cold and keeps them warm in winter
the hair close to our skin i
hair on our body and arms are soft and the hair on our head is coarse hair
like us the hairy skin of sheep has two types of fibres that form its fleece or wool i
the fine soft under-hair provide the fibre for making wool
to obtain breeds of sheep that possess only fine under hair their parents are carefully chosen
this process of selecting parents for obtaining special characters in their offspring such as soft under hair in sheep is termed as selective breeding
such sheep give not only better quality of wool but the yield per sheep is also higher
animals that yield wool wool commonly available in the market is sheep wool
several breeds of sheep are found in different parts of our country
however the fleece of sheep is not the only source of wool there are other sources of wool also
other sources of wool are  yak wool is common in tibet and ladakh
 angora wool is obtained from angora goats in hilly regions such as jammu and kashmir
 the underfur of kashmiri goat is soft and it is woven into fine shawls called pashmina shawls
 the fur hair on the body of camels is used as wool
 llama and alpaca found in south america are also yielding wool
for obtaining wool sheep are reared and bred their hair is cut and processed into wool
we will first discuss the rearing and breeding of sheep
rearing and breeding of sheep rearing of sheep means to look after the sheep by providing them feed food shelter and health care
the persons who look after the sheep or rearers are called shepherds
sheep are herbivores and prefer to eat grass and leaves
apart from grazing sheep rearers also feed them a mixture of pulses corn jowar oil cakes material left after taking out oil from seeds and minerals
in winter sheep are kept indoors and fed on leaves grain and dry fodder
so the breeding of sheep is done to obtain such breeds of sheep which yield good quality of wool in large quantities
these breeds of sheep have a thick coat of hair on their body and are called sheep of good breeds
this raises the quality and quantity of wool produced
once the reared sheep have developed a thick coat of hair the hair is shaved off for getting wool
the cut off ‘wool coat’ of a sheep along with a thin layer of skin is called fleece
the fleece consists of soft woollen fibres
the fleece of sheep is usually kept in one piece
processing of fibres into wool the wool which is used for knitting sweaters or for weaving shawls is the finished product of a long process
processing of fibres into wool involves the following steps step i the fleece of the sheep along with thin layer of skin is removed from the body
this process is called shearing
the hair of the sheep are shaved off by using a saving machine similar to that used by barbers
shearing does not hurt the sheep because the uppermost layer of the skin of sheep is ‘dead’
the shearing cutting the hair of sheep is done in hot weather of summer so that sheep may survive without their protective coat of hair
the hair of sheep grow again before the onset of winter and protect them in cold weather
the fleece or hair of sheep provides woollen fibres
woollen fibres are then processed to obtained woollen yarn
step ii the fleece of sheep or cut the hair of sheep contains dust dirt dried sweat and grease etc
so the sheared hair of sheep is thoroughly cleaned by washing with soap or detergent and a lot of water in tanks
this process of washing of sheared hair is called scouring
scouring makes the fleece of sheep clean
the scoured fleece is then dried
now-a-days scouring is done by machines
the process of separating the fleece of a sheep into sections according to the quality of woollen fibres such as fine coarse long short etc is called sorting
in sorting the hairy skin is sent to a factory where hair of different textures is separated or sorted
every section of wool obtained after sorting contains the same quality wool
the same quality wool obtained is then mixed together
step iv the small fluffy fibres called burrs are picked out from the hair burrs are soft fluffy fibres in wool
after this the fibres are scoured again and dried
the wool obtained after this is ready to be drawn into fibres
step v the natural fleece or hair of sheep or goat is white brown or black in colour
the white woollen fibre obtained by sorting can be dyed in different colours
step vi the fibres are straightened combed and rolled into yarn
the long woollen fibres are spun or twisted into thick yarn called wool which is used for knitting sweaters etc
the short woollen fibres are spun into fine yarn and then woven on a loom to make woollen clothes like shawls etc
finally we conclude that the sheep’s hair is sheared off from the body scoured sorted dyed combed and spun to obtain wool for knitting sweaters and woollen yarn for weaving cloth
occupational hazard the wool industry is an important source of livelihood for many people in our country
the people who do the job of sorting separating the fleece of sheep into fibres of different qualities are called sorters
the sorter’s job is very risky because sometimes they get infected by the bacteria called anthrax which cause a deadly blood disease called sorter’s disease
the risks faced by people working in any industry due to the nature of their work are called occupational hazard
sorter’s disease is an occupational disease
silk silk is a natural fibre which is obtained from an insect called silk moth
so silk fibres are also animal fibres
silkworms spin the silk fibres
the silk fibre is made up of a protein
silk is the strongest natural fibre
the rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture
sericulture is a very old occupation in india
india produces a lot of silk on a commercial scale
before we discuss the process of obtaining silk it is necessary to know the interesting life history of the silk moth
life history of silk moth formation of silkworm the female silk moth lays eggs on mulberry leaves
the eggs are hatched into very small larvae within a week
the larvae of silk moth are called caterpillar or silkworm
the silkworms feed on the leaves of mulberry tree and grow bigger in size
development of cocoon when the silkworm or caterpillar is ready to enter the next stage of its development called pupa it first weaves a net to hold itself
then it swings its head from side to side
during these movement of head the silkworm secrets fibre made of protein which hardens on exposure to air and becomes silk fibre or silk thread
soon the silkworm or caterpillar covers itself by silk fibres and turns into pupa
this covering is known as cocoon
the silkworm continues to develop in the form of pupa inside the cocoon to form the silk moth
production of silk in order to produce silk the silkworm developing inside the cocoon as pupa is not allowed to mature into an adult silk moth
so as soon as the cocoon is formed it is used to obtain silk fibres and the developing silkworm as pupa gets killed
some of the silkworms as pupae are however allowed to live and mature into silk moths so that they can lay eggs to produce more silkworms
there is a variety of silk moths which look very different from one another and the silk yarn they yield is different in texture coarse smooth shiny etc
thus tassar silk kosa silk mooga silk etc are obtained from cocoons spun by different types of moths
the most common silk moth is the mulberry silk moth
mulberry silk is soft lustrous shiny and elastic and can be dyed in beautiful colours
pure and artificial silk pure silk is obtained from the cocoons of silkworm and it is made up of protein
artificial silk is obtained from wood pulp and it is made of modified plant material ‘cellulose’
just like silk wool is also made up of proteins
so a piece of woollen fabric also burns giving the smell of burning hair
the thread which burns giving a smell of burning paper will be cotton fibres
cotton and paper both are carbohydrates
paper is made of cellulose obtained from wood pulp
so on burning cotton and paper both give similar smell
from cocoon to silk for obtaining silk silk moths are reared and their cocoons are collected to get silk thread
rearing silkworms a female silk moth lays hundred of eggs at a time
the eggs are stored carefully on strips of paper or cloth and sold to silkworm farmers
they warm them to a suitable temperature for the larvae to hatch from egg
the larvae are kept in clean bamboo trays along with young and freshly chopped mulberry leaves
after - days the silkworms stop eating and start spinning the cocoons
small racks or twigs may be provided in the trays to which cocoons get attached
processing silk the cocoons are collected and boiled in water to kill the insect inside them
the resulting fibre is known as raw silk
the silk fibres separate out
reeling the silk the process of taking out fibres from the cocoon for use as silk is known as reeling the silk
reeling is done in special machines
silk fibres are spun into silk threads which are woven into silk cloth by weavers
discovery of silk the discovery of silk was made in china a long time bach
the empress found white worms eating up mulberry leaves
she also noticed that they were spinning shiny cocoons around them
accidentally a cocoon dropped into her cup of tea and a tangle of delicate threads separated from the cocoon
silk industry began in china and was kept a closely guarded secret for hundreds of years
later on traders and travellers introduced silk to other countries
the route they travelled is still called the ‘silk route’
even today china leads the world in silk production
india is also among the leading silk producing countries of the world
in india a large number of women are engaged in various activities related to the silk product such as the rearing of silkworms reeling of silk from cocoons and processing of raw silk into fabrics
in winter it is our common experience that we feel cold inside the house and if we come out in front of sun rays then we feel warm
now if we know that how do we feel this sensation of warm or cold then what will be our answer think
hot and cold in our daily routine we come across a number of objects out of which some are hot while other objects are cold e
when a frying pan kept on a burning gas stove becomes hot but the handle of the pan is cold
even among the hot objects some objects may be hotter than the other
in the same manner among the cold objects some objects may be colder than the other
so if i ask you how you decide the relative hotness or coldness of objects then your answer will be’by simply touching the objects’
but our sense of touch is not enough in telling us whether an object is really hot or cold so this can be understood by performing a simple activity
temperature and thermometer the degree of hotness or coldness of the object is known as the temperature of an object
the temperature of an object is an only property that indicates which object is hot and which one is cold
a high temperature of a body indicates that it is very hot whereas a low temperature of the object indicates that it is quite cold e
the temperature of boiling water is quite high so boiling water appears to be very hot
on the other side the temperature of melting ice is quite low
so ice appears to be very cold on touch
it is measured by using an instrument called thermometer which has a scale marked on it which is used to read the temperature e
so each division is called a degree
the temperature of an object should always be stated with its unit
so the most common unit for measuring temperature is degree celsius °c
both the clinical thermometer and laboratory thermometer are mercury thermometers
so when a particular amount of heat is supplied to the thermometer bulb consisting of mercury by the hot body whose temperature is to be measured then the mercury expands and get rises in the glass tube of the thermometer
this fact is used in measuring the temperature
clinical thermometer it is the thermometer which is used for measuring the temperature of the human body
in case of fever it is used by a doctor or at home to measure the temperature of the patient
this thermometer consists of a long glass tube having a thin and uniform bore
there is a glass bulb at one end of the glass tube which consists of mercury as shown in the figure given below features of a clinical thermometer there is a very short range of temperature of a clinical thermometer i
the short range of a clinical thermometer is because of the fact that the temperature of human body normally does not go below °c or above °c
just above the bulb containing mercury a clinical thermometer has a kink in its glass tube which is to prevent the back flow of mercury into the thermometer bulb when the thermometer bulb is removed from the mouth of a patient
due to this we can read the correct body temperature of the patient even after removing the thermometer bulb from his mouth
note after noting the body temperature the level of mercury can be brought down by giving jerk to the thermometer tube
as mercury is very toxic and is difficult to dispose off so thermometer must be handled carefully
clinical thermometer should not be used to measure the temperature of objects other than the human body
it should not be kept in the sun or near a flame otherwise it may break
nowadays digital thermometers are used which do not use mercury
reading a clinical thermometer there are following steps to read the temperature on a thermometer
step i firstly wash the thermometer with an antiseptic solution and if in case the antiseptic solution is not available then wash it with clean water
step ii gently hold the thermometer tube in your hand and give it a jerk in such a way that the mercury thread in the thermometer tube falls below the reading of °c
step iii now put the bulb of the thermometer under the tongue of the patient for about one minute
then take out the thermometer from the patient’s mouth
step iv in order to read the temperature hold the thermometer horizontally in your hand and rotate it slowly
when we see a magnified image of the mercury thread in its tube then a position will come
now read the temperature on thermometer tube in level with the top of the mercury thread
precautions while reading the thermometer a clinical thermometer should not be used for any object other than the human body
there are some following precautions which are to be observed while reading a clinical thermometer
 wash the clinical thermometer before and after using preferably with an antiseptic solution
 the clinical thermometer should be read by keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight
 while reading the clinical thermometer it should never be held by the bulb
 the clinical thermometer should be carefully handled
laboratory thermometer a device which is used for measuring the temperature in a science laboratory is called a laboratory thermometer
this thermometer is made up of a long glass tube having a thin bore
the graduation marked on the tube of a laboratory thermometer can measure the temperature from -°c to °c this is known as the range of a laboratory thermometer
also determine how much a small division on this thermometer reads this is also known as least count of the thermometer it is due to the fact that this information is required to read the thermometer correctly
these are the special thermometers which automatically record the maximum and minimum temperature of the day
the maximum s and minimum temperature of the last day reported in weather reports in tv and newspapers are measured by the maximum-minimum thermometers
reading a laboratory thermometer there are following steps to read the temperature on a thermometer
step i first of all take some hot water in a beaker
step ii now try to hold the laboratory thermometer from its glass tube and immerse the bulb of the thermometer in hot water taken in the beaker
step iii here we will observe the shining thread of mercury moving up in the thermometer tube
after some time the mercury will stop rising and stand at one place
now read the temperature on the thermometer tube which corresponds to the top of the mercury thread
this will give us the temperature of hot water taken in the beaker
note to measure the human body temperature a laboratory thermometer cannot be used because as soon as we tahe out the bulb of the laboratory thermometer from the mouth of a patient the mercury level wilt starts falling quickly due to cooling of its bulb by air
so this will provide a wrong value of the body temperature
 the thermometer bulb should be surrounded from all sides by the substance whose temperature is to be measured
 the thermometer reading should be taken while its bulb is still in touch with the substance whose temperature is being measured and by keeping the mercury level along the line of sight
 the thermometer should not be held by the bulb
 the thermometer should be carefully handled
 we should note down the temperature reading by keeping the thermometer bulb immersed in hot water because if the thermometer bulb is taken out of hot water then its mercury thread will start falling and this will give a wrong reading for the temperature of hot water
digital thermometer there are most of the common thermometers like mercury thermometers which use a liquid metal called mercury for their working
mercury is a toxic substance a poisonous substance and thus it is very difficult to dispose of safely if a thermometer breaks
so there is a lot of concern over the use of mercury in thermometers
also during these days digital thermometers are available which do not use mercury
transfer of heat heat flows from a hot object to a cold object or heat flows from an object at the higher temperature to another object which is at a lower temperature
this flow of heat is known as the transfer of heat e
if you dip a steel spoon into a cup of hot tea then we will find that the temperature of spoon rises and it becomes hot
in this case some of the heat contained in hot tea has been transferred to spoon which is placed inside it
when the two objects attain the same temperature then the flow of heat stops
this means that no heat will be transferred from one object to another if the temperature of the two objects is the same
there are three ways through which heat can be transferred from a hot object to a cold object
conduction the mode of transfer of heat from hotter part of a material to its colder part or from a hot material to a cold material in contact with it without the movement of material as a whole is known as conduction
in all the solids heat is transferred by the process of conduction
conductor and insulator of heat materials which allow heat to be conducted through them easily are conductors of heat
those metals such as iron copper silver aluminium etc
 are good conductors of heat
bad conductors of heat are those materials which do not allow heat to be conducted through them easily
these materials are also known as insulators of heat
wood plastic and glass are insulators of heat
uses of good and bad conductors of heat during the winter season we generally wear woollen clothes
if we compare them with cotton clothes then we will find that the wool fibres have much more space between them
these get filled with air which is a bad conductor of heat
hence being an insulator both wool and air together prevent the heat from our bodies from escaping out
also jute and sawdust are bad conductors of heat
we cover the ice with a jute cloth of sawdust to prevent it from gaining heat from the surroundings and melting
the two thinner blankets one on top of the other during the winter season are very much effective because the air layer trapped between the thinner blankets creates insulation and provides the protection from cold
sometimes there are two things which are at the same temperature
it seems like they are at different temperatures one being cold and the other being warm
this happens because some things are a good conductor of heat while others are poor conductors of heat
during winter season a metal object kept in a room feels very cold to touch but a wooden object in the same room feels warmer to touch
metal object is a good conductor of heat
so when we touch the metal object it conducts away heat from our hand quickly
and by losing heat our hand feels cold
on the other side the wooden object being a poor conductor of heat does not allow the heat of our hand to escape and hence feels warmer to touch
the water or most liquids and air or gases are bad conductors of heat
convection the mode of transfer of heat from the hotter part of a fluid liquid or gas to its colder parts by the movement of the liquid or gas itself is known as convection
the transfer of heat by convection can take place only in liquids and gases
it is due to the reason that the particles in liquids and gases can move about freely
so the transfer of heat by convection cannot take place in solids because the particles in the solids are fixed at a place and cannot move about freely
it is also not occurred in empty space or vacuum because there are no particles of any kind in empty space which can move and transfer heat
so due to this reason it cannot transfer heat by conduction but it transfers heat by the process of convection
convection in air air is a very poor conductor of heat air transfers heat from its hotter parts to the colder parts by the process of convection
sea and land breezes the blowing of sea breeze and land breeze in coastal areas is generally occurred due to the convection of heat in air
in coastal areas during the day time the breeze generally flows from the sea towards the land and during the night time blows from the land towards the sea
sea and land breezes are actually convection of heat
during the day the land heats up more than water
due to this the air over the land becomes hotter and lighter and rises up
so the air from the sea which is cooler and heavier rushes to take the place created by hot rising air
therefore a sea breeze blows during the day
during the night the land loses heat faster than water and becomes cooler and the air over the sea is now warmer due to which it rises up and the cooler air over the land rushes to take its place
therefore we observe a land breeze at night
radiation the mode of transfer of heat through which heat energy from a hot body to a cold body by means of heat rays without any material medium between them is known as radiation e
the sun’s heat reaches the earth by the process of radiation
the sun is very far away from the earth and there is mainly an empty space vacuum between the sun and the earth even then the heat from the sun reaches the earth
these radiations travel through the vacuum between the sun and the earth at a very high speed and ultimately reach us on the earth
therefore we can say that the transfer of heat from a hot object to a cold object by the process of radiation does not require any medium
in our daily life activities we have many situations where heat is transferred by radiation through air e
 depending on the temperature of surroundings our body too gives heat to the surroundings or receives heat from the surroundings by radiation
 if a hot utensil filled with hot milk is kept away from the flame then it cools down by transferring its heat to the surroundings by radiation
 if we stand next to a burning fire then we will feel the heat of the fire falling on our face
the heat is transferred from the fire to our face by the process of radiation
clothes during hot summer days people prefer to wear white clothes or light coloured clothes because light coloured clothes absorb less heat from the sun and hence keep us cool and comfortable in hot weather while in the cold winter days people prefer to wear dark clothes because the dark coloured clothes absorb more heat rays from the sun and keep us warm in winter season
thus we can say that dark coloured objects absorb heat better and also emit heat better than light coloured objects
now let us try to study this concept on the basis of the given activity
wool is a poor conductor of heat
moreover there is air trapped in between the wool fibres
this air prevents the flow of heat from our body to the cold surroundings
some of these substances taste sour some taste bitter some taste sweet and some taste salty
acids bases and salts are the three important groups of chemical substances that are used by us in different ways
some of the acids bases and salts occur in nature and they can be made artificially in factories also
thus all sour substances essentially contain acids
substances like lemon juice orange juice unripe mango and curd taste sour
they taste sour because they contain substances called acids in them
the chemical nature of such substances is acidic
the acids in these substances are natural acids
however there are other substances like baking soda it does not taste sour
it means that it has no acids in it
it is bitter in taste
and if prepare a solution of baking soda in water and rub it between your fingers it feels soapy
the chemical nature of such substances is said to be basic
all the acids mentioned in table occur in nature
acids and their sources name of acid found in acetic acid vinegar formic acid ant’s sting citric acid citrus fruits such as oranges lemons etc
lactic acid curd oxalic acid spinach ascorbic acidvitamin c amla citrus fruits tartaric acid tamarind grapes unripe mangoes etc
there are some special substances that have different colours in acidic and basic mediums
these substances are known as indicators
the indicators change their colour when added to a solution containing an acidic or a basic substance
some naturally occurring indicators are litmus turmeric china rose petals gudhal and red cabbage juice
these indicators show different colours in acidic and basic media
they are used to test whether a substance is acidic or basic in nature
litmus- a natural dye a naturally occurring indicator i
litmus is obtained from certain lichens small plants and used as a dilute solution
litmus has mauve purple colour in water
in an acidic solution it turns red
usually it is available as a red and blue litmus paper
turmeric is another natural indicator turmeric is a bright yellow powder obtained from a plant
it is is called ‘haldi’ in hindi
turmeric contains a yellow dye
turmeric turns red in basic solution
it is used as indicator in the form of turmeric paper
china rose as an indicator china rose is a natural indicator
it is called ‘gudhal’ in hindi
it is a extracted from the red flowers of china rose plant with water
acid rain the rain containing excess of acids called an acid rain
the rain becomes acidic because carbon dioxide sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid sulphuric acid and nitric acid respectively
it can cause damage to buildings historical monuments plants and animals
this happens as follows  acid rain makes the water of lakes ponds and rivers too acidic due to which fish and other aquatic animals get killed
 acid rain eats up the leaves of the trees gradually
by losing leaves the trees die
acid rain also damages crop plants in the fields
 acid rain damages the metal structures like steel bridges etc when it falls on them
 acid rain damages the surfaces of buildings and monuments made up of marble
neutralisation acids and bases are chemically opposite substances
so when an acid is mixed with a base they neutralise or cancel the effect of each other
when an acid solution and a base solution are mixed in suitable amounts both the acidic nature of the acid and the basic nature of the base are destroyed
the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic
so the reaction between an acid and base is known as neutralisation
salt produced in the reaction may be acidic basic or neutral in nature
the evolved heat raises the temperature of the reaction mixture
acid + base → salt + water heat is evolved e
hydrochloric acid hcl acid + sodium hydroxide naoh base → sodium chloride nacl salt + water ho if dilute sulphuric acid is added to lime water which is a base then neutralisation reaction takes place and the reaction mixture becomes hot
we are going to use an indicator which you have not used so far
note phenolphthalein is an indicator used in the neutralisation process
when the solution is basic phenolphthalein gives a pink colour but if the solution is acidic it remains colourless
neutralisations in everyday life the neutralisation reactions involving acids and bases play a very important role in our everyday life
the treatment of an ant’s sting remedy for indigestion soil treatment and the treatment of factory wastes all involve neutralisation reaction
indigestion our stomach produces hydrochloric acid
this hydrochloric acid helps in digesting our food
sometimes excess of hydrochloric acid is produced in the stomach which causes indigestion
due to indigestion sometimes a person feels pain in the stomach and irritation
to relieve indigestion we take an antacid such as milk of magnesia
milk of magnesia contains a base called magnesium hydroxide
magnesium hydroxide neutralises the excess acid present in the stomach and cures indigestion
another antacid is baking soda which contains a base sodium hydrogen carbonate
the sting of an ant contains an acid called formic acid
the effect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing a mild base like baking soda solution sodium hydrogen carbonate or calamine solution
calamine solution contains a base called zinc carbonate
thus being a base baking soda solution or calamine solution neutralises the acidic liquid injected by the ant and cancels its effect
soil treatment the soil may be acidic or basic naturally
the plants do not grow well if the soil at a place is too acidic or too basic
excessive use of chemical fertilisers makes the soil acidic
when the soil is too acidic it is treated with bases like quicklime calcium oxide or slaked lime calcium hydroxide
these bases neutralise the excess acid present in the soil and reduce its acidic nature
factory wastes the waste substances discharged by many factories contain acids
the factory wastes are therefore neutralised by adding basic substances before discharging them into water bodies
these changes may involve one or more substances
souring of milk is a change
making a sugar solution is a change
similarly setting of curd from milk is a change
some changes that we have noticed around us are melting of ice making of ice cream melting of wax stretching a rubber band evaporation of water cutting of paper breaking of glass pane bending of glass tube by heating boiling of water sublimation of camphor etc
broadly these changes are of two kinds  physical changes  chemical changes physical changes in a physical change a substance undergoes changes only in its physical properties such as shape size colour and state and no new substance is formed
first we shall perform some activities to show the physical changes that are taking place all around us are characteristics of physical changes the physical changes are temporary changes which can be easily reversed to form the original substance
in such a change no new substance is formed
thus we noticed that the important characteristics of physical changes are as follows  no new substance is formed in this change
 it is a temporary change and is generally reversible
 a temporary change in colour may take place
chemical changes chemical changes are also called chemical reactions
a chemical change occurs when two substances react chemically to form a new substance with different chemical properties
all the new substances which we use in various fields of our life are produced as a result of chemical changes or chemical reactions
a change with which we are quite familiar is the rusting of iron
almost every iron or steel object kept in the open gets rusted slowly
it acquires a coating of a brownish substance called rust and the process is called rusting
we can usually see iron gates of parks or farmlands iron benches kept in lawns and gardens almost every article of iron kept in the open gets rusted
the agricultural tools such as spades and shovels also get rusted when exposed to the atmosphere for some time
in the kitchen a wet iron pan tawa often gets rusted if left in that state for some time
it is different from iron on which it gets deposited
now we shall perform some activities to show the chemical changes where new substances are formed
when baking soda nahco reacts with vinegar which contains acetic acid carbon dioxide comes out which turns lime water milky therefore it is a chemical change
in all these activities we saw that in each change one or more new substances are formed
when the magnesium ribbon was burnt the ash was the new substance formed
the reaction of copper sulphate with iron produced two new substances i
vinegar and baking soda together produced carbon dioxide which turned lime water milky
so all those changes in which one or more new substances formed are called chemical changes
these are permanent changes which can usually not be reversed to form the original substance
ultraviolet may be given off or absorbed
 the sound may be produced
 a change in smell may take place or a new smell may be given off
 a colour change may take place
 a gas may be formed
chemical changes in our daily life chemical changes are very important in our lives
indeed every new material is discovered by studying chemical changes e
if metal is to be extracted from an ore such as iron from iron ore we need to carry out a series of chemical changes
medicine is the end product of a chain of chemical reactions
important and useful new materials such as plastics and detergents are produced by chemical reactions
let us consider some more examples of chemical changes
we saw from the activity that burning of magnesium ribbon is a chemical change
burning of coal wood or leaves is also a chemical change
in fact burning of any substance is a chemical change
burning is always accompanied in the production of heat and light
 an explosion of a firework or crackers is also a chemical change which produces heat light sound and unpleasant gases that pollute the atmosphere
 when food gets spoiled it produces a foul smell
this shows that new substances have been formed in the spoiled food which has a foul smell
so the spoilage of food is a chemical change
 if we cut an apple into slices and kept in the open for some time we will find that the cut surface of apple acquires a brown colour
this change in colour is due to the formation of the new substance by the action of oxygen or air
so this change in colour is a chemical change
 when an acid reacts with a base then a neutralisation reaction takes place in which two new substances salt and water are formed
so neutralisation is a chemical change
 during photosynthesis the plants intake carbon dioxide and water in the presence of chlorophyll and sunlight to form two new substances glucose food and oxygen
so photosynthesis is a chemical change
 in the process of digestion the various food materials break down to form new substances which can be absorbed by the body so the process of digestion is a chemical change
rusting of iron when an iron object is left exposed to moist air it chemically reacts with oxygen and water in the air to form a red-brown flaky substance called rust
the process of rusting can be represented by the following equation iron fe + oxygen o from air + water ho → rust iron oxide feo rusting occurs in the presence of both oxygen and water
the more humid the air the faster the rusting occurs
the rust slowly eats away or corrodes the iron leading to considerable loss
since iron is used in making bridges ships * cars truck bodies and many other articles the monetary loss due to the rusting is huge
preventions of rusting rusting can be prevented by not allowing the iron to come in contact with moisture and air
the simplest method is to coat the iron with oil grease or paint
these coats should be applied regularly to prevent rusting
a more efficient method is to coat the iron with another metal such as zinc or chromium
the process of depositing a layer of zinc on iron is called galvanisation
the iron pipes we use in our homes to carry water are galvanised to prevent rusting
the salt in water speeds up the process of rusting
this leads to huge monetary loss to the shipping industry
rusting of iron can be prevented by allowing it to make stainless steel
stainless steel is made by mixing iron with carbon and metals like chromium nickel and manganese
crystallisation seawater contains salts dissolved in it which makes it salty
we have learnt in class vi that salt can be obtained from seawater by the process of evaporation
the salt obtained in this manner is not pure and its crystals are small
the shape of the crystals cannot be seen clearly
large crystals of pure substances can however be obtained from their solutions by the process of crystallisation
it is an example of a physical change
the process of cooling a hot concentrated solution of a substance to obtain crystals is called crystallisation
the process of crystallisation is used to obtain crystals of a pure solid substance from the impure solid substance
impure copper sulphate powder can be purified by the process of crystallisation to obtain large crystals of pure copper sulphate
during summer we switch on fans to keep ourselves cool we use light coloured clothes in order to reflect the heat
during winter we use dark colour clothes and wrap ourselves in warm clothes to protect us from cold environment
similarly during the rainy season we use umbrella or raincoat as it may rain anytime
the weather of a place changes day after day and week after week
it is a complex phenomenon that may vary over very short periods of time like hour to hour
therefore our daily activities are planned according to the weather predicted for a particular day
the daily report of weather is provided on television radio and even in newspaper
weather it may be defined as the day to day condition of the atmosphere at a place with respect to the temperature humidity rainfall wind speed etc
elements of weather the temperature humidity rainfall wind speed and other factors are called the elements of the weather which are described below 
temperature the weather is mainly affected by the sun that produces heat and raise the temperature
the sun provides light as well as heat on the earth
it is necessary for the production of energy
the < heat from the sun is absorbed by the earth’s surface oceans and atmosphere which plays an important role in determining the weather of any place
the time of sunrise and sunset also changes throughout the year
rainfall the amount of water droplets that fall back on the earth after condensation of water vapours is called rainfall
when the temperature is too low these droplets in the cloud get freezed into crystals of ice and comes on the earth as snowfall
during winters the temperature falls after sunset causing condensation of water vapours near the ground
these droplets hang in the air to form fog
note rainfall is generally measured in millimetre
the instrument that is used to measure the rainfall is called rain guage
it is a measuring cylinder with a funnel kept on its top which collects the rainwater
the rainwater collected in the measuring cylinder gives the measure of rainfall
humidity it is defined as ‘the amount of water vapour in air which causes dampness of air’
air has the ability to hold certain
the capacity of air to hold water increases with rise in temperature and falls if heavy rainfall occurs
the humidity is measured by the instrument called hygrometer which consists of two thermometers
the bulb of one thermometer is wet and the other is dry
wind speed it is caused due to the difference in air pressure
during summer the wind blows from indian ocean and bay of bengal and causes rain in india while during winter it blows from the mountain of north india towards northern plain and causes cold weather winter season
weather prediction the prediction of weather is done by scientists called meteorologist who study the changes in the weather
the weather is predicted by studying the patterns of weather and factors affecting them
in india the weather reports are prepared by the meteorological department of government
this department collects the data of temperature wind etc
 and predicts whether on television or radio or newspaper
the weather report is recorded everyday in the form of graph and published in a table form showing readings of different elements of weather
difference in time of sunrise and sunset there is the difference in the time of sunrise during summer and winter
in summer the sun rises earlier in the morning and the sun sets late in the evening during the month of june while sun rises late and sets early in the month of december
therefore days are longer and night shorter in summers while day is shorter and night is longer during winter
climate ‘the average weather pattern taken over a long time is called the climate of that place
’ different places in the world have different types of climate
the annual record of long term average temperature and rainfall at a particular place is called climate chart
it gives an idea about the climate at a particular place during a specific period of the year
the major factor which determines the climate of a place is called latitude imaginary lines on earth
factors that determine the climate the several factors that determine the climate at a place are  distance from the sea climate of a place varies according to the closeness of the sea
the places that are near the sea are moderate not too hot nor too cold e
while the places that are away from the sea have extreme climate having very hot summer or too cold winter e
 altitude or height above sea level climate also varies according to the altitude
the higher altitudes are cooler e
kolkata and kerala have high humidity while
rajasthan and haryana have low humidity
climates in india the climate of india varies in different regions
these can be described as below  the northern region of himalayas has cold and moderately wet climate e
 plains has a moderately hot and wet climate e
 south has very hot and wet climate e
 the western region has hot and dry climate e
 north-eastern india has wet climate e
assam and receives rain for a major part of the year
animals are adapted to survive in the conditions in which they live
skin colour shape body covering
it usually occurs in response to some external stimuli e
frogs and bear undergoes hibernation or winter sleep during hard winter season
warm-blooded animals are able to keep the constant body temperature
animals that live in a very cold or hot climate must possess special features to protect themselves against extreme cold or heat
the features and habits that help an animal to adapt to their surrounding are a result of the process of evolution
according to their habitat animals adapt themselves
these animals may be grouped as polar region and tropical rainforest animals
the polar regions the polar regions as the name suggest are situated near the poles i
north pole and south pole
the countries that belong to the polar regions are canada greenland iceland norway sweden finland alaska in usa and siberian region of russia
polar regions show’ extremely colder climate which is covered with snow and remain cold for most part of the year
in this region the sun does not set for six months and even does not rise for other six months
the temperature goes down below -°c during winters in polar regions
the ground remains frozen most of the year and water becomes available only during the short summer when snow melts
mosses and short lived flowering plants grow in these regions
animals living in these regions are adapted in different ways to cope with the conditions of temperature light and moisture and also according to the availability of food in that region
polar bears and penguins are the animals that live in polar region
besides these whales seals are the other animals are also found in polar regions
some fishes foxes musk oxen reindeer and birds also live in polar regions
adaptations in polar bear polar bear is a large and white bear that lives in the north polar region of the earth
it helps them to blend with their surrounding snow white back ground and cannot be noticed by their predators
beneath the fur is a thick coat of fat which insulates the body from cold and keeps the bear warm
ii a polar bear is a good swimmer which has wide and large paws that help it to swim
these paws also help bear to walk on the snow easily
iii they have a strong sense of smell so that they can locate their prey easily
they also possess small ears to keep the body surface area to the minimum and reduce the heat loss from the body
iv the thick layer of fat beneath the skin also stores food in winter when food is scarce
adaptations in penguins another well-known animal living in the polar regions is the penguin which can survive due to the following adaptations i these are black and white in colour which merges well with the white background of ice and snow
ii they have thick skin and a thick layer of fat below their skin which protects them from extreme cold
iii they possess a streamlined body flipper-like wings and webbed feet which make it a good swimmer
this adaptation helps penguin to catch fish as prey
migration migration is the seasonal journey taken by different animals or birds to escape the extreme climatic condition and the search of food e
siberian cranes migrates towards warmer region in the autumn by travelling several thousands of kilometers
they are seen in the
bharatpur rajasthan and sultanpur haryana and sometimes in wetland of north-east and other parts of india
migratory birds  sometimes travel as much as  km to escape the extreme climatic condition of their habitat
these birds fly high where the wind flow is helpful and cold conditions allow them to disperse the heat generated by their flight muscles
these birds have a built in sense of direction and know in which direction they have to travel
some birds use landmarks to guide them
some birds are guided by the sun during daytime and by stars during night
some birds can use the magnetic field of the earth to fnd the direction
besides birds some fishes insects and mammals also migrate seasonally in search of more hospitable climates
the tropical rainforest the tropical region lies near both the sides of equator line on the earth
these regions are hot but get plenty of rainfall
therefore this region is humid
even in coldest month the temperature is generally higher than about °c
during hot summers the temperature may cross °c
days and nights are almosts equal in length throughout the year
these regions are rich in vegetation and large diversity in animals is also seen in this region
in india tropical rainforests are found in western ghats and assam other countries of the world like south east asia central america malaysia indonesia brazil republic of congo kenya uganda nigeria and central africa also have tropical rainforest
the major type of animals living in the rainforest are monkeys apes gorillas tigers elephants leopards lizards snakes birds and insects
since there are large number of animals found in these regions
there is an intense competition for food and shelter among these animals
so the animals are adapted in such a way that they eat different kinds of food and live in different kinds of places to overcome competition for food and shelter respectively
the adaptations in different animals living in tropical rainforests can be discussed as follows adaptations in red-eyed frog the red-eyed frog lives on trees in tropical rainforest
they have sticky pads on their feet that help them to climb trees
it does not live in water and has a green back and a creamy underside
it has big and bulging bright-red eyes and it is a nocturnal
it sleeps during the day and becomes active during night and feeds on the insects present on the tree
the bulging eye of frog protects it from its predator
the sudden opening of big and bright-red eyes frightens the predator for a while and in the meantime the frog gets time to jump to a safe place
the green colour of the frog helps it to hide within the green leaves of the tree and helps it to protect from predators
adaptations in monkey the monkeys living in tropical rainforests have long tails for grasping branches
their hands and feet are adapted in such a way that they can easily hold the branches of trees
the eyesight of monkeys is very good which helps them in leaping between the branches to escape from their predators
monkeys eat fruits seeds leaves root and insects as their food which is present in abundance in tropical rainforest
it has silver-white mane which surrounds the head from the cheeks down to its chin which is the specific characteristic of this animal
it is called lion-tailed because its tail is like that of lion having bunch or tuft of hair at the end
they spend most of their time feeding in the upper canopy of trees i
it mainly feeds on fruits seeds young leaves stems flowers and buds
they also can eat insects present under the bark of the tree
since it is able to get sufficient food on trees
it rarely comes down on the ground and spends a major part of its life on the tree
it is a good climber with its hand and feet adapted to hold the branches of trees firmly
adaptation in toucan toucan is a bird which is found in tropical rainforest and which possesses a long strong and large beak
this bird is adapted for tropical rainforest in several ways
it is a colourful bird which possesses a strange beak
it lives most of the time in the holes of big trees
the long and large beak helps toucan to reach the fruits attached to the ends of even thin branches of tree that are weak enough to support its weight
it is an adaptation of this bird to get the unreachable fruits
its large beak also helps in temporary storage of fruits which is collected by toucan
these possess feet that are adapted for grasping the branches of trees firmly
toucan can change the colour of its feather so as to get mixed up with the surrounding and they are not easily noticed by predators and remain safe
adaptations in lion and tiger these are also called as big cats and are carnivore which eat only flesh of other animals
the yellow brown colour of lion and black stripes of tiger helps them to hide in the forest by blending with the surroundings
it helps these carnivores to catch their prey
 they have strong sense of smell which helps them to locate their prey
 they also develop sensitive hearing capacity to find its prey
 they have eyes in front of their head which enable them to have a correct idea of the location of their prey
they also have good eyesight
 their strong legs help them to run fast and long sharp and strong claws in front of their legs help them to catch and tear their prey
adaptations in elephant elephant is a well-known animal of indian tropical rainforest
these are plant eaters and are adapted in many remarkable ways to survive in tropical rainforest
these adaptations can be discussed as follows i the elephant has a long trunk which is used as nose and has a strong sense of smell
it also helps elephant to pick up the food
the long trunk is also used for breathing
it can reach up to the branches of trees and help it to eat tree leaves
it is used for sucking water from lakes or rivers drinking
ii the elephant possesses tusks long pointed teeth that are used in tearing the bark of trees which the elephant loves to eat as food
it also helps elephant to fight their enemies and protecting themselves
iii the elephant has large ears that help it to hear even very soft sounds and can sense the danger
it also helps the elephant to keep it cool in the hot and humid climate of the tropical forest
the layer of air surrounding the earth is called atmosphere
the moving air is called wind
it is formed by the heat of the sun or it may be said that unequal heating of different parts of the earth forms wind
air exerts pressure the continuous physical force exerted on an object or against an object when something comes in contact with it is called pressure
air exerts pressure in different ways under different situations and on all objects and in all directions
air pressure helps the leaves of trees banners or flags to flutter when the wind is blowing
it causes the tyres balloons to inflate
importance of air pressure the importance of air pressure can be discussed as follows  it creates wind the difference in atmospheric pressure gives rise to the wind on the earth
 it influences weather air movement i
downward or upward movement of air caused due to differences in pressure creates the cloudy and clear sky brings rain or fine weather
 weather forecasting the changes in air pressure gives important clues for weather forecasting
the air pressure is measured by an instrument called barometer
similarly when we ride a bicycle against the direction of the wind boat against wind direction or flying of kite against the direction of the wind we can feel the air pressure
when we pump air or fill air into the bicycle tube the air molecules inside the tube collide with the walls of the tube and exerts air pressure
the pressure exerted by air filled in a bicycle tube keeps the tube tight and makes the bicycle tyre feel hard
if we continuously fill more and more air into the bicycle tube the air pressure in the bicycle tube will increase too much that tube may get burst
these observations also show that air exerts pressure
high-speed winds high-speed winds are accompanied by reduced air pressure
air moves from the region of higher pressure to the lower pressure
the greater the difference in pressure the faster the air moves
it is due to the heat of the sun from which air becomes warm producing a low pressure
so the warm air rises up and the cool air from the surroundings moves towards the sea
the fast-moving air blowing over an object helps in lifting the object up by producing a region of low pressure above it
this can be shown by the following activity
air pressure is caused due to the constant bombardment by moving air molecules on the surface of the paper strip
we have learnt that when high-speed air is blown over a strip of paper it is lifted up
similarly if the high wind blows over the roof of houses it will reduce the air pressure above the roofs and if the roofs of houses are weak then higher air pressure from below will lift up the roofs which can then be blown away by the fast winds
therefore weak roofs of houses can be lifted and blown away by the high-speed wind that is called a storm
air expands on heating gases or air expand more than solid and liquid on heating
air is a mixture of gases
on heating the molecules of air gain kinetic energy
it moves away from each other thus occupying more space
therefore the air becomes lighter
warm air rises up whereas comparatively cool air tends to sink towards the earth’s surface
when the air is heated its volume increases and occupies a bigger space
when the air is heated it becomes lighter and rises up in the sky
this is the reason that when we burn woods the smoke rises along with the hot air near the place of fire
this can be demonstrated by the following activities
this fact of air is utilised in launching hot air balloons
in nature there are several situations where warm air rises at a place
the air pressure at that place is lowered
the cold air from the surrounding areas rushes in to fill its place
wind currents the wind is the movement of air which depends on the difference in air pressure in two regions
air moves from the region of high pressure to the region of low pressure in the atmosphere
this difference in air pressure is created by uneven heating or unequal heating on the earth
the region where the air rises an area of low pressure is created while the region where the air sinks an area of high pressure is created
the uneven heating on the earth takes place in two situations 
uneven heating between the equator and the poles the region of the earth which is closed to the equator of the earth gets the maximum heat from the sun
therefore the air in these regions gets warm and rises creating an area of low air pressure
the cooler air from the region of upto  degrees latitudes belt on either side of the equator moves or rushes towards the equator and replaces the warm rising air
at the poles the air is colder than at latitudes about  degrees
therefore the warmer air moves upward and colder air rushes in
this makes the wind blow from the poles of the earth towards the warmer region up to about -degree latitudes
uneven heating of land and water i during summer the earth near the equator warms faster than the water in the oceans
the air above the land gets warmer and rises up in the sky creating a low-pressure area
therefore the winds flow from the oceans towards the land
these winds carry a lot of moisture with them and bring rain
it is a part of the water cycle
these rain-bearing winds are called the monsoon winds
ii during winter the direction of the wind gets reversed
the wind blows from the land to the sea due to the difference in air temperature between the land and sea
this happens so because during winter the land cools down faster than the water in the oceans and the temperature of water in the ocean is higher than that of land
the warm air over the ocean rises up creating a region of low pressure and cooler air from the land rushes towards the ocean
thus the air flows from land to ocean carrying only a little water vapour
hence bring only a small amount of rain in the winter season
note the word monsoon is taken from the arabic word ‘mausam’ which means ‘season’ the summer monsoon which brings heavy rain is very important to the farmers because this annual rainfall helps in growing crops
farmers depend on the rain for the irrigation of their crops
sometimes rain creates some problem also
in nature itself there are certain situations that can sometimes create disasters and can pose a threat to humans animals and plant life
the instrument used to measure the wind speed is called anemometer
thunderstorms when air moves gently low speed it is called a breeze while when it moves violently high speed it is called a storm
when the pressure of air drops it indicates the possibility of a storm
the swift movement of the falling water along with the rising warm air producing sound lightning heavy rain and • strong wind is called thunderstorm
it develops in hot and humid tropical areas like india and is accompanied by heavy rains or hail
thunderstorms are produced by the dark clouds which form at fairly low altitude in the atmosphere
in the tropical area the air gets warmed up and makes it to rise whereas humidity provides the water vapour for the formation of cloud
therefore it can be said that to occur a thunderstorm it requires moisture rapidly rising warm air and sea breeze or mountains
precautions to be taken during a thunderstorm a thunderstorm is accompanied by lightning which is a giant electric spark
it may kill people animal and can damage buildings etc
therefore you must take the following precautions during a thunderstorm to protect ourselves from the lightning
when you are in open area  do not take shelter under an isolated tree or building
if you are in a forest take shelter under a small tree
do not lie on the ground
 do not take shelter under an umbrella having a metallic end
 never sit near a window open garages storage sheds metal sheds etc to take shelter
 one can take shelter in a car or a bus
 do not go in the water
if you are in the water get out and go inside a building
close the doors and windows properly
 do not touchoperate any electrical devices or telephone
 do not watch tv cyclones a cyclone is a weather condition consisting of a system of high-speed winds revolving around a central area of very low pressure
cyclones develop over tropical seas
it is a violent storm with a wind speed of -  kmh
it is accompanied by strong winds and heavy rains
structure of a cyclone the centre of a cyclone is a calm area and is called the eye of the storm
the diameter of the eye varies from  to  km
it is a region free of clouds and has light winds
around this calm and clear eye there is a cloud region of about  km in size
in this region there are high speed winds - kmh and thick clouds with heavy rains
away from this region the winds speed gradually decreases
note cyclones are developed over the indian ocean bay of bengal and arabian sea
the whole coastline of india is vulnerable to cyclones
meteorologists study weather and give various names to the cyclones as hugo katrina rita hud-hud phailin etc
formation of cyclones factors like temperature humidity wind speed wind direction and rotation of the earth contribute to the development of a cyclone
the energy required to form and sustain a cyclone comes from the heat of condensation of water vapour present in moist air rising from the surface of hot seawater that condenses at altitudes to form a cloud
when the air above the seawater is heated a region of low pressure is created because warm and moist air rises up
* the cool air rushes in forcing up more hot air
once the cyclone is formed it begins to move over the surface of the sea
the strongest wind and the heaviest rain occur in the towering thunder clouds about - kilometres from the centre of the cyclone
cyclone comes to an end quickly if a cyclone moves over land because it no longer receives heat energy and moisture from warm seawater
note a cyclone is known by different names in different parts of the world
it is called a hurricane in the american continent
in the philippines and japan it is called a typhoon
destruction caused by cyclones cyclones are very destructive
these are the greatest storm on earth
cyclones cause widespread destruction and loss of life in coastal areas
when the strong winds push water towards the shore even if the storm is hundreds of kilometre away it gives the first indication of an approaching cyclone
the high-speed wind accompanying cyclone produces a tremendous force of the high-speed wind
it causes damage by toppling trees electric poles telephone poles and vehicles damage houses and even hurt people thus causing a great loss of life and property
the low pressure in the eye lifts the water surface in the centre
the rising water may be as high as - m and appears like a water-wall moving towards the shore
as a result the seawater enters the low-lying coastal areas and can destroy roads and railway tracks wash away vehicles damage houses drown people and animals damage crops causing a great loss of life and property
the cyclone also reduces the fertility of the soil
the flood may pollute drinking water and may cause several water-borne diseases
effective safety measures on the part of the government  cyclone forecast and warning system must be installed
 information about cyclone should be given to the people in time through rapid communication system
 construction of cyclone-shelter in cyclone-prone areas
 an administrative arrangement should be taken to move people faster to safer places
on the part of the people  people should follow the essential guidelines provided by the agencies through tv radio phones etc
 a proper arrangement should be made to shift the essential household goods domestic animals etc
 avoid driving on a road which is underwater because flood might have damaged the road
 phone numbers of all the emergency services like police fire brigade hospitals etc
some other precautions to be taken when you are staying in a cyclone hit area  do not drink water that could be contaminated store drinking water for emergencies
 do not touch wet switches and fallen power lines
 do not go out just for the sake of fun
 cooperate and help your neighbours and friends
 do not pressurise the rescue force by making under demands
tornadoes a tornado is a violent spinning storm in the shape of a dark funnel with a narrow end on the land
these are formed over the sea and are called water spouts
tornado develops from the thunderstorm and is formed mostly on the land
these are violent and can reach the speeds of more than  kmh destroying everything in their path
these are not very common in india but occurs in canada and the usa
most of the tornadoes are weak
when the warm air from the earth’s surface rises up it whirls around it and causes very high-speed winds
these are much smaller than cyclones i
from a few meters to a few hundred meters but the wind speed can rise as high as  kmh
the funnel of tornado sucks up everything at its bases like dust debris cars trees and even houses
destruction caused by tornadoes tornado causes much damage due to the heavy force of its high-speed winds
a tornado causes considerable damage when it passes over land
tornado causes the following destructions  it uproots trees electric poles and telephone poles it disrupts power supply and telecommunications
 it lifts the people and vehicles off the ground and hurls them hundreds of metre away
this may lead to the death of people and damage to vehicles
 tornado causes extensive damage to buildings
it creates lower pressure outside the building much lesser than inside the building and the building can explode
 shut all the doors and windows and take shelter under the study table
 bend down on your knees and protect your head and neck using your arms
stay indoors until it is safe to come out
 if someone is in the vehicle and tornado begins he should get out of the vehicle and take shelter in a ditch or low-lying area and lie flat in it
 keep distance from electric wires and damaged areas
advanced technology has helped during the early part of the last century the people residing in coastal regions have less than a day for the preparations or to evacuate their homes from an overcoming cyclone
but today’s situation is very different
today we are much protected
we have satellites and radars which can issue the cyclone watch or cyclone alert before  hrs in advance of any expected storm and a cyclone warning is issued  hrs in advance
therefore coastal residents have sufficient time to prepare and evacuate their homes
the message related to the cyclone is broadcasted over the ratio every hour or half hour when a cyclone is nearer the coast
in this way the advanced technology has helped us in giving better protection from cyclones
it is the uppermost layer of earth’s crust which is blackish-brown in colour
major functions of the soil are  it supports plant growth by holding the roots firmly and supplying water and nutrients to the plants
 it is also essential for agriculture which provides us with food clothing and shelter for all
 it supplies water and nutrients to plants
therefore we can say that soil is an inseparable part of our life
it increases the fertility of soil
soil pollution sometimes people throw polythene bags and plastic articles in the soil
some other substances like chemicals and pesticides also pollute the soil
to prevent the soil pollution the use of polythene bags must be banned and the waste products and chemicals must be treated before they are released into the soil
the use of pesticides in the agricultural field must also be minimised in order to prevent soil pollution
soil profile soil is formed by breaking down of rocks by the action of wind water or climate by the process called weathering
during this process the rocks are worn away to form small particles by long exposure to the elements of weather
weathering is a very slow process as it takes thousands of years for a huge rock to turn into fine particles
the nature of the soil depends upon the rocks from which it has been formed and types of vegetation that grow on it
the soil profile is a vertical section through different layers of the soil
each horizon differs in texture colour depth and chemical composition
different horizons of the soil are discussed further
a-horizon or topsoil it is the uppermost layer of soil and is usually dark in colour because of the presence of minerals and humus in it
it provides the nutrients in plants since the roots of most plants are confined to this layer
humus is the dark brown coloured layer which consists of dead rotting remains of plants and animals
humus helps in making the topsoil porous
this layer is generally soft and retains more water in it
b-horizon or subsoil this layer of soil lies just below the topsoil
it is made up of slightly bigger rock particles than that of the topsoil
it does not have much humus and is lighter in colour than topsoil
it is somewhat harder and more compact than the topsoil
the subsoil is rich in minerals and iron oxides
c-horizon or substratum the layer of soil which lies just below the subsoil is called c-horizon
it consists of small pieces of broken rocks with cracks and crevices formed by the weathering of bedrock or parent rock
bedrock or parent rock below the c-horizon unweathered solid rock is found which is called as bedrock
it is non-porous and can produce the soil over a long period of time
rainwater gets collected over it to form the water table
this layer is hard enough and is difficult to dig with a spade
soil types the weathering of rocks produces small particles of various materials these include sand and clay
the relative amount of sand and clay depends upon the rock from which the particles were formed
the rock particles present in soil are of different sizes and chemical compositions
on the basis of sizes the rock particles present in soil can be divided mainly into four major groups i clay these are formed by the smallest rock particles
these are so small that we cannot see a single clay particle and it feels smooth
ii silt these are made up of somewhat bigger rock particle than clay
it is not so smooth as clay
silts are found deposited at river beds
floods deposit the silt from rivers in the field
iii sand these are made up of larger particles enough than that of silt and can be easily seen
these are coarse to touch due to their larger size
iv gravel these are the largest sized rock particles that are present in the soil
these are the tiny stones that are present in topsoil in very small quantity
the soil in different geographical areas contains different proportions of sand clay and silt in them
it also contains a small amount of hummus in them
depending upon its composition soil can be classified as sandy soil clayey soil and loamy soil
the size of the particles in the soil influences its properties
these are quite large particles
there are large spaces between them which are filled with air
water can drain quickly through these spaces
the sandy soil tends to be light well aerated and rather dry
since it is aerated can be ploughed easily and cannot retain water so it is not good for plants
since it is light it can be easily blown away if left bare
it does not possess humus thus it is less fertile
it can be made fertile by adding manure in them which increases its water-holding capacity
this soil is not sticky and therefore these cannot be used to make pots bricks toys and statues
ii clayey soil’ clay particles are smaller and packed tightly so that it leaves a little space for air
water drains very slowly through clayey soil
these also contain very little humus
it is heavier than sandy soil
clayey soil is more fertile than sandy soil
the fertility of clayey soil can be improved by adding some sand and humus to it
clayey soil is very sticky and can be used to make pots bricks toys statues etc
iii loamy soil it is a mixture of sand clay and silt with a small amount of humus in it
therefore it is very fertile and the best topsoil for growing plants
it has water holding capacity and excess water can also be drained out through it easily
it is a smooth partially gritty and sticky soil
properties of soil soil possesses various properties like  it contains air
 it can hold water or moisture
 it can absorb or soak water  it allows water to pass down through it
percolation rate of water in soil soil is porous i
it has tiny pores in it
when water is poured over it then some water gets absorbed in the soil and rest passes down the soil
percolation rate is the amount of water in ml that is percolated through the soil in unit time i
the percolation rate differs in different soil types
the rate of percolation can be calculated by using the following formula percolation rate mlmin = for example if water in bottle ‘a’ percolates in  min in ‘b ’ it percolates in f  min in bottle
while in bottle ‘c’ it percolates in  min then the percolation rate mlmin will be calculated as follows for bottle ‘a’ rate of percolation = = mlmin for bottle ‘b rate of percolation = =  mlmin for bottle ‘c’ rate of percolation = =  mlmin percolation rate is highest in sandy soil because it is very loose
on the other hand clayey soil is very compact and therefore has the lowest rate of percolation
the rainwater moves or reaches to well faster and in a greater amount from sandy soil
since clayey soil can retain water in them
these are the best soil to grow paddy because paddy requires standing water in fields
the kutcha unpaved road due to percolation of water becomes dry after rain while pakka road does not
moisture in soil the soil contains some water in it which is called soil moisture
usually ‘moisture is present as a thin film around the soil particles
this moisture is absorbed by the roots of plants
thus the moisture content of the soil is very important for the growth of crops
absorption of water by soil soil contains moisture in it but it can still absorb or soak a lot of water
the ability or capacity of the soil to absorb a limit of water is called absorption percentage
it can be calculated as follows percentage of water absorbed = ×  different types of soil can absorb water to a different extent i
some absorb more water while other absorbs less water
when we talk about the percentage of water absorbed by the soil it means the mass of water absorbed by  g of soil
water retention the ability of soil to hold water is called water retention
the space between soil particles is called pores provide the passage for gases and moisture within the soil
the ability of soil to retain water is strongly related to the particle size
water molecules hold more lightly to the fine particles of the clayey soil than the coarser particle of sandy soil
when we perform this activity with different soil samples we will see that
 sandy soil will absorb less water and allows more water to percolate
 a clayey soil will absorb more water but allow less water to percolate
 sandy soil will absorb less water than clayey soil because of the large spaces between the soil particles
the area where there is a lot of clay in the soil stagnant water collects above the soil whenever it rains
soil and crops different types of soil are found in different parts of india
soil is mainly affected by wind rainfall temperature light and humidity
the plants that grow on the surface of the earth are called vegetation
it includes green grass herbs shrubs bushes crop plants and trees
types of soil crop grown clayey soil wheat gram and paddy loamy soil lentil tomatoes corn and oats sandy-loam soil potatoes cotton and cereal rye vegetation is mostly in the fertile topsoil of the earth and covers the soil like a green sheet spread on the surface of the earth
the component of soil along with various climatic factors determine the type of vegetation in a particular region
 clayey and loamy soils are both suitable for growing cereals like wheat and gram
such soils are good at
 for lentils masoor and other pulses loamy soils which drain water easily are required
 for cotton sandy-loam or loam which drain water easily and can hold plenty of air are more suitable
 crops such as wheat are grown in the fine clayey soils because they are rich in humus and are very fertile
leeladhar dada was preparing the soil to make items like surahi matki kalla earthen frying pan etc
john asked him the complete procedure of making such items
a summary of conversation they all had with leeladhar dada is given below  leeladhar and other porters bring the black soil from a piece of barren land
 dry soil is then placed in a large tank and would be cleaned of pebbles etc
after removing these things the soil is then soaked for around  hours
this soil would be kneaded after mixing burnt horse dung
 this kneaded soil is then placed on the wheel and appropriate shape is given
the final shape of the material is given with hands
these are kept for drying for three days
these items are baked at high temperature after drying in air and then coloured
soil erosion the removal of land surface by water wind or ice is known as erosion
the topsoil is very fertile and in the absence of it the plants cannot grow
in the absence of plants the soil becomes loose
as the plant roots bind to the soil
soil erosion is mainly caused by the large scale cutting of forest trees and plants
this process of cutting down of trees is called deforestation
erosion of soil is more severe in the areas of little or no surface vegetation like the desert or barren land
therefore cutting of trees and deforestation must be prevented
the effects of soil erosion are famines flood desertification and damage or spoilage of environment
our food is stored energy which is released during respiration
breathing is the process during which we breathe in air having oxygen and we breathe out air rich in carbon dioxide
the air rich in oxygen is transported to all parts of the body and ultimately to each cell
this oxygen is utilised by the cell for respiration
types of respiration on the basis of the presence or absence of oxygen respiration is classified into two types 
aerobic respiration when the breakdown of glucose occurs with the use of oxygen it is called aerobic respiration
during aerobic respiration glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water and energy is released
aerobic respiration takes place in mitochondria
the glucose is not completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water
an intermediate compound is formed with the release of less amount of energy during this process
it can be shown as follows glucose alcohol + carbon dioxide + energy yeasts such as saccharomyces cerevisiae and certain bacteria carry out anaerobic respiration
during anaerobic respiration also called fermentation yeast produces ethanol or alcohol as a byproduct which is used in making wine and beer
the carbon dioxide produced by yeast is used in the bread making industry
the c gas released during this process causes the bread dough to rise
anaerobic respiration in muscles usually aerobic respiration takes place in humans but under certain conditions anaerobic respiration may also occur in our muscles for a short time due to temporary deficiency of oxygen
when we perform a heavy exercise like running cycling walking weight lifting etc
 we require a large amount of energy
to meet the energy requirement our muscle cells perform anaerobically
during this process the glucose or food in the muscle cells is partially broken down in the absence of oxygen to form lactic acid and some extra energy is released
the following equation shows the production of lactic acid glucosefood lactic acid + energy this ours because during vigorous physical activity the utilisation of oxygen ours at a faster rate in the muscles that can be supplied by the blood
when the lactic acid produced during anaerobic respiration gets accumulated in the muscles it causes muscle cramps
this improves the circulation of blood and oxygen supply to the muscle cells increases
the increased supply of oxygen results in the complete breakdown of lactic acid into carbon dioxide and water thereby giving relief from cramps
differences between aerobic and anaerobic respiration aerobic respiration anaerobic respiration it occurs in the presence of oxygen
it takes place in the absence of oxygen
the complete breakdown of food takes place in aerobic respiration
partial breakdown of food occurs in anaerobic respiration
end products of aerobic respiration are co and water
end products of anaerobic respiration are alcohol and co or lactic acid in muscles
thus breathing involves two steps which take place alternately
 inhalation taking in of air rich in oxygen into our body is called inhalation
 exhalation giving out air rich in carbon dioxide from our body to the external environment is called exhalation
this activity must be performed under the supervision of your teacher or parent
close your nostrils and mouth tightly and look at a watch
note down the time for which you could hold your breath
we will soon start feeling uneasy and cannot hold our breath for even one minute
breathing rate the number of times a person breathes in a minute is termed as breathing rate
an adult human being can inhale and exhale - times in a minute
it is the average breathing rate of an adult human being
the breathing rate of a person is not always constant
it changes according to the oxygen requirement of the body
breathing rate is somewhat faster in women than in men and in children it is higher - timesmin than adults
breathing rate is slowest while sleeping as less energy is required while maximum during heavy exercise like running weight lifting etc
increased breathing rate provides a greater amount of air entry into the lungs hence blood can absorb oxygen at a faster rate
faster breathing supplies more oxygen to the body cell for producing more energy required for heavy exercises
because of this food gets broken down at a faster rate and thus make us feel hungry
when we feel drowsy sleepy or tired we yawn i
open our mouth wide to take a long and deep breath of air because our breathing rate slows down and the body does not receive sufficient oxygen
mechanism of breathing the mechanism of breathing can be understood by the following points  normally we take in air through our nostrils
when we inhale air it passes through our nostrils into the nasal cavity
 from the nasal cavity the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe
 lungs are present in the chest cavity
this cavity is surrounded by ribs on the sides
 a large muscular sheet called diaphragm forms the floor of the chest cavity
smoking tobacco in the form of beedi cigarette or cigar damages our lungs gradually and causes ill health
while smoking smoke along with chemicals present in tobacco enters our body
these chemicals present in tobacco damages the lungs in many ways like breathing becomes difficult causes lung cancer heart diseases etc
smoking also affects people around smokers as they also inhale air containing tobacco
this is called passive smoking
the mechanism of breathing involves the movement of the diaphragm and ribcage
the complete process of breathing can be discussed as follows breathing in or inhalation when we breath air in or inhale two processes occur together i
the muscles between the ribs contract causing the ribcage to move upward and outward while the diaphragm contracts and moves downwards
this upward and downward movement of ribcage and diaphragm respectively increases the space in the chest cavity and makes it larger
as the chest cavity becomes larger it sucks air from outside the lungs and lungs get filled up with air and expand
breathing out or exhalation when we breath air out or exhale the reverse process takes place i
the muscles of the ribs release causing the ribcage to move downward and inward while diaphragm releases and moves upward
when the chest cavity becomes smaller the air is pushed out of the lungs
sneezing the air we inhale contains various types of unwanted particles like smoke dust pollen etc
during inhalation these particles get trapped in the hair present in our nasal cavity
they cause irritation in the lining of the nasal cavity as a result of which we sneeze
sneezing expels the foreign particles from the inhaled air so that dust-free clean air may enter into the lungs
we should take care while sneezing in that we must cover our nose so that foreign particles expelled during sneezing may not be inhaled by another person nearby us
exhaled air contains carbon dioxide the air is a mixture of gases like nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide and water vapour etc
the difference between inhaled air and exhaled air is that the inhaled air contains more oxygen while exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide
besides oxygen and carbon dioxide the air also contains more water vapour
exhaled air contains more water vapour than the inhaled air
the air which we inhale and exhale is a mixture of gases and water vapours
the inhaled air is rich in oxygen while exhaled air is rich in carbon dioxide
animals such as elephants lions cows goats frogs lizards snakes birds have lungs in their chest cavities like humans for respiration
the smaller animals like cockroaches earthworms fishes ants and mosquitoes do not have lungs
therefore respiration in these animals takes place by other means
cockroach insects like the cockroach grasshopper etc
 have tiny holes on the sides of their body
their openings are called spiracles
the spiracles on the body of insects are connected to a network of thin air tubes called tracheae which spreads into the whole body of the insect where the exchange of gases takes place
air rich in oxygen rushes through spiracles into the tracheal tubes diffuses into the body tissue and reaches every cell of body
similarly co from the cells enters into tracheal tubes and moves out through spiracles
the blood in these animals do not contain haemoglobin and is not red in colour
they cannot carry oxygen to all the parts of the body
the tracheal system or spiracles are only seen in insects not in any other group of animals
they absorb the atmospheric oxygen through their moist skin and transport it through the blood to all the cells
frog a frog-like human possesses a pair of lungs but when they are in the water they breathe through their moist and slippery skin
when they are on land they breathe through their nostrils and a pair of lungs
they do also breathe underwater
some of them given below fish fishes are the aquatic animals that live in water
the oxygen dissolved in water enters through the gills
gills are actually the projections of skin and have blood vessels for the exchange of respiratory gases
the fishes breathe by taking in water through its mouth and sending it over the gills
the oxygen dissolved in the water is extracted by the gills and the extracted oxygen is absorbed by the blood
this oxygen is then carried to all the parts of fishes for respiration
the carbon dioxide produced during respiration is brought back by the blood into the gills and expelled into the surrounding water
these possess nostrils which are called blowholes
their blowholes are located on the upper parts of their heads
these animals breathe in through their nostrils and lungs
dolphins and whales come to the surface of sea-water from time to time to breathe in air sometimes whales release a function of water that moves upwards like a spray
this is because when a whale breathes air out of its blowhole it appears as a spray or mist also called a spot
it can be seen from many miles away
blowholes are surrounded by muscles that keep the holes closed when the whales or dolphins are underwater and open it when the animal is at the surface and needs to breathe
the human cannot survive underwater because they do not possess any gills to make use of oxygen dissolved in water for breathing
when we go underwater we have to take oxygen gas cylinders for breathing
plants also take in oxygen from the air and give out carbon dioxide
they also breakdown glucose into c and water and releases energy to perform other functions
the respiration in plants differs from the animal because in plants respiration occurs through leaves and roots etc
they carry out respiration independently i
each plant part can independently take in oxygen from the air utilise it to obtain energy and give out co
respiration in leaves the leaves of the plants have tiny pores on their surface which are called stomata
the exchange of gases i
o and co in the leaves takes place through stomata during respiration
respiration in roots root cells of the plants respire under the ground
they also need oxygen to carry out respiration and releases energy for their own use
root cells get oxygen from the air present in the spaces between the soil particles
plant roots have a large number of tiny hairs on them which are called root hairs
oxygen from the air present in soil particles diffuses into root hair and reaches to the cells of the root where it is utilised for respiration
note if a potted plant is over watered for a long time the plants die
this is because the water molecules fill the space between soil particles and push the air out
due to this reason the oxygen is not available to the roots for aerobic respiration and plants die
due to the production of alcoholic products as a result of undergoing anaerobic respiration
it is not wise to sleep under a tree during the night because in the night plants do not photosynthesis and plants are unable to use co
so a person will suffer from suffocation and feel the excess weight on the chest
the leaves are more actively involved in photosynthesis during the day time in the presence of sunlight
the co released during respiration is utilised by the plant during photosynthesis to produce its food
during photosynthesis the o is released by plants which are taken up during respiration in plants
therefore a balance between co and o is maintained by the plants
respiration thus provides continuous energy to plants to perform all its functions regardless of time
waste products produced due to the various functions inside the body also need to be transported and removed
in animal body these functions are carried out by an internal transport system called as circulatory system
circulatory system circulatory system or blood circulatory system is the main transport system in human beings and animals
it makes food water and oxygen available to every parts of the body and helps in removing waste material urea co etc
the circulatory system consists of blood blood vessels and heart
it is red in colour and it flows through a network of tubes in whole body called blood vessels
blood is pumped to every part of the animal by heart
blood consist of four components i
plasma red blood cells rbcs white blood cells wbcs and platelets
plasma is a liquid while rbcs wbcs and platelets that float in it
plasma it is the sticky liquid part of the blood which is pale yellow in colour
it is % water and 
it contains dissolved substance such as digested food and waste products and carry them from one part to another part in the body
red blood cells rbcs rbcs are red in colour due to the presence of pigment called haemoglobin
this pigment carries oxygen by binding with it
haemoglobin is a red protein that binds with oxygen and transports oxygen to all the parts of the body and ultimately to all the cells
it is the presence of haemoglobin which makes the blood appear red
when haemoglobin binds with oxygen it forms oxyhaemoglobin which is transported to various body parts
the carbon dioixde from the various body parts is transported back by binding again with haemoglobin
it forms carboxyhaemoglobin with c this c is expelled out from the body
white blood cells wbcs the wbcs fight against infection and protect us from diseases
wbcs eats up the germs like bacteria that cause disease
wbc also makes antibodies that fight against infection
the number of wbc is quite less than rbc
wbc can change their shape and move on their own
they can squeeze out of the blood vessels to reach any part of the body
these are colourless and help in the clotting of blood in a cut or wound
if a cut or wound is made the blood starts flowing from it after some time the platelets plug the cut and the bleeding stops due to the formation of a dark red clot
if the platelets are not present in the blood the blood flow from the cut or wound will not stop causing excess loss of blood which may be fatal to a person leading to death
functions of blood various functions of blood are  it transports substances like digested food from the small intestine to the other parts of the body
 it carries water to all the parts of the body
 it carries oxygen and c during circulation
 it carries waste products like urea from liver to kidney for excretion in urine
 it protects the body from disease
blood vessels these are tubes or pipes that carry blood throughout the body
it runs between the heart and the rest of the body
there are three major types of blood vessels in the body i
arteries these carry blood from the heart to all the parts of the body
these lie quite deep under our skin and cannot be seen easily
arteries have thick elastic walls as the blood flows at high pressure due to pumping action from the heart through arteries
no valves are present in the arteries
aorta is connected to the left ventricle of the heart
it carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to all the parts of the body except the lungs
another artery called the pulmonary artery is connected to the right ventricle of the heart and carries deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs
veins these are the blood vessels that carry blood from all the parts of the body back to the heart
these tube-like blood vessels are situated just under the skin and can easily be seen as greenish-blue tubes or lines below the skin
these carry deoxygenated blood from the body parts to the heart
veins have thin walls and blood flows at low pressure through the veins
therefore veins have valves in them which allow the blood to flow in one direction and prevent the backflow of blood in veins
usually veins carry deoxygenated blood but pulmonary vein that is connected to the left atrium of the heart carries oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart
differences between artery and vein artery vein it is thick walled tube present deep under the skin
it is thin walled tubes lying just below the skin
it cannot be seen easily
it appears as a greenish blue line under the skin
it has valves which prevent the backflow of blood
it carries oxygenated blood except pulmonary artery
it carries deoxygenated blood except pulmonary vein
blood flows at high pressure
blood flows at low pressure
pulse rate to know your pulse rate place the middle and index finger of your right hand on the inner side of your left wrist
you will feel the throbbing movement at this place
this throbbing is called the pulse the pulse is produced due to the blood flowing in the arteries
now count the number of beats or pulse in one minute
the number of beats per minute is called the pulse rate
at the resting phase a normal person has a pulse rate between - beats per minutes
run for about  minutes and again measure the pulse rate you will notice that the pulse rate per minute will be increased after running
capillaries these are extremely thin blood vessels that connect the arteries to veins
these allow substances to pass from blood into the body cells and also from body cells into the blood
the exchange of substances like food  c etc
 between the blood and the body cells take place through the capillaries
it is rich in oxygen
the oxygenated blood comes from the lungs where oxygen from the fresh air gets mixed into blood and is carried towards the heart
the blood that is rich is carbon dioxide i
oxygenated blood is bright red in colour while deoxygenated blood is darher in colour
blood groups the blood group of an individual human being always remains unchanged throughout their life
karl landsteiner described that human blood can be divided into four groups i
a b ab and o
these are named on the basis of substance present in the blood rbc
every man has one of these four groups of blood which is inherited from parents to offspring and is never changed
if a person gets injured and heavy blood loss occurs there is a need to give blood of other people to the patient
the person who gives the blood is called a donor while the person who receives the blood is called the recipient
 a b ab and o o all the group i
 a b ab and o o the process of donation of blood from one person to another is called blood transfusion
before donation the blood group must be matched because transfusion of different groups can be dangerous
the rbcs of the patient receiving blood will stick together and may cause the death of the patient
this matching of blood group is called blood group compatibility
location of heart the heart is located in the chest cavity slightly towards the left side
it lies between the two lungs and above the diaphragm
the heart is made up of special muscles called cardiac muscles that do not fatigue and are not the solid muscle
the size of our heart is roughly equal to our left closed and is enclosed in a protective cover called pericardium fist
the heart is hollow inside
structure of heart the heart has four compartments called as chambers
the upper two chambers of heart are called atria sing atrium and the lower two chambers of heart are called ventricles
on the left side of heart are left atrium and left ventricle and on the right side of the heart are right atrium and right ventricle
the atria and ventricles are separated by valves
these are the muscular flaps that allow the blood to flow in only one direction
the right side of the heart carries deoxygenated blood while the left side of the heart carries oxygenated blood
the heart is separated by a partition called septum from right side of the heart to the left side
this prevents mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood inside the heart
left and right side of the heart the left and right side of the heart act as two separate pumps
the oxygenated blood must be kept separated from deoxygenated blood to supply good amount of oxygen to the body cells for respiration and release of energy
if the oxygenated and deoxygenated blood will mix with each other the body cells will not be able to get enough oxygen for respiration due to which less energy will be released in the body
heartbeat the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of heart muscles that produce a specific sound of lubb-dubb is called heartbeat
the average heartbeat of an adult person is - beats per minute at resting but the number increases during and after a physical exercise or when a person is excited
it helps in rapid respiration and to produce more energy
the heartbeat is equal to the number of pulse in a minute
stethoscope the heartbeat can be heard by an instrument called as stethoscope
it is used by doctor to amplify the sound of heart
it consists of  a chest piece that carries a sensitive diaphragm  two earpieces  a tube joining both the parts doctors get to know about the condition of heart by listening to the sound through a stethoscope
take a small funnel of -cm in diameter and fix a rubber tube tightly on the stem of the funnel
stretch a rubber sheet on the mouth of the funnel
fix it tightly with the help of rubber band
put the open end of the tube on one of your ear
now place the mouth of the funnel on your chest near the heart
listen the thumping sound carefully
these sounds are the heartbeat
count the number of beats in a minute
mechanism of circulation the contraction of two atria is immediately followed by the contraction of two ventricles which leads to the continuous flow of blood in the human body
the mechanism of circulation can be summarised as follows  the blood passes through the capillaries of the lungs and is mix with oxygen
this oxygenated blood is then carried from the lungs to the left auricle by four pulmonary veins
 the left atrium contracts and the oxygenated blood is pushed into left ventricles
 the left ventricle pumps the blood into the biggest blood vessels of the body called aorta
it distributes oxygen-rich blood to the different parts of the body
 the right atrium contracts and pushes the deoxygenated blood into right ventricles through the opened valve
 right ventricles pump the impure blood into pulmonary arteries that carry it to the right and left lungs for purification
the valves present on both sides of heart regulate the blood flow from one chamber to another
this cycle keeps on circulating continuously day and night even when we sleep
the english physician william harvey ad - discovered the circulation of blood
the current opinion in those days was that blood oscillates in the vessels of the body
for his views harvey was ridiculed and was called circulator
he lost most of his patients
however before he died harvey’s idea about circulation was generally accepted as a biological fact
circulation in sponges and hydra sponges and hydra are simple animals that do not possess any circulatory system
they live in water and therefore the food and oxygen enter into their body along with water
the water also carries the c and other waste material away from the body as it moves out of their bodies
when our body uses food water and air it produces some by-products or unwanted substances
these are called waste materials
these waste material are toxic or poisonous and causes harm to the body
therefore the waste material must be removed from the body so that a person may stay healthy
these waste material produced after the various functions of body cells include co urea sweat etc
it is produced as a waste product of the decomposition of unused food proteins in the liver
it is a poisonous substance which must be removed from the body
urea from blood is removed by the kidney
the urea and other unwanted salts when dissolving in water form a yellowish liquid waste called urine
% other waste salts and % water
an adult human being normally passes out -
 l of urine per day
the excretory system collects the urine and remove it
the excretory system of human being consists of two kidneys two ureters a bladder and a urethra
kidneys these are called the magic filters
it is brick red coloured about  inches long
it is richly supplied with blood vessels
kidney can filter the unwanted substances from the blood
each kidney consists of thousands of tiny filters called nephrons
when the blood containing urea and other waste salts pass through these nephrons it filters the blood and removes urea and salts and urine are left in the kidney
the urine thus formed by each of the kidney is then passed through the ureter a tube-like structure which connects the kidney to the bladder to urinary bladder
the urine is stored in the urinary bladder for some times and at regular intervals it is removed through the opening at the end of the tube called urethra
the process of ejection of urine is called micturition
when the bladder becomes full with urine this bladder sphincter opens and allows the urine to flow out
carbon dioxide it is produced as a waste product in our body cells during the process of respiration
the food is broken down during respiration to release energy and releases co as a by-product
this co is removed from our body by the lungs during exhalation
sweat it is the liquid waste of the body that is produced by the sweat glands present in our skin
sweat contains water some unwanted salts and urea in a very small amount
during hot summer we sweat a lot
this gets evaporated from our body
this helps to provide the cooling effect to the body
the two major functions of sweat are as follows   it helps to remove excess water salt and urea from the body
 it helps to keep our body cool during hot summer days
dialysis the normal functioning of the kidney is necessary for good health of a person
but sometime s the kidney may stop working due to infection or injury
this condition of kidney is called kidney failure which may lead to the accumulation of urea in the blood of a person
since urea is a toxic substance which must be removed from the blood
such person having kidney failure cannot survive unless his blood is filtered periodically through the artificial kidney machine to remove urea
the process used for cleaning the blood of a person by separating the waste product urea from it is called dialysis
this machine removes urea and other waste the product periodically
the long term solution for the patient suffering from kidney failure is kidney transplantation
the donated kidney is transplanted in its place by performing ^surgery
excretion in animals like humans animals also excrete waste products from their body
the way in which waste materials are removed from the body of the animal depends upon the availability of water
fishes are the aquatic animals that excrete ammonia as their waste product
this ammonia is excreted in the gaseous form which directly gets dissolved in water
the land animals like lizards birds snakes etc have less water availability
these animals excrete this waste material in the form of uric acid pellets
these are white coloured semi-solid excretory products of several land animals
urea is the excretory product of animals like human cow goat etc
and is eliminated as urine
transport of substances in plants plants take up water and dissolved minerals from the soil through their roots and transport it to their leaves
the leaves use this water and mineral for synthesising their food by the process called photosynthesis
the food produced by green plants in transported back to all the parts of plant body
therefore it is clear that plants also need a transport system for carrying water minerals and food through various parts of their body
transport of water and minerals plant root absorbs the water and mineral from the soil
the roots possess root hair which increase the surface area of the root for absorption of water and minerals nutrient that is dissolved in the water
it is moved from roots up to the stem and leaves through the tube-like tissue called as xylem
absorption and flow of water is a continuous process through the xylem tissue
it thus transports water and minerals to the leaves of the entire plant
transport of food material the food manufactured in the leaf is transported to different parts of plants
this transportation of food material from leaves to the other parts of plants is carried out by the tissue called phloem and the process of transport of food material is called translocation
the phloem consists of vessels that are known as sieve tubes
the xylem and phloem tissues together form the vascular bundles or conducting tissues
transpiration the process of evaporation of water through the stomata present on the surface of leaves is called transpiration
the continuous evaporation of water from the leaves produces an upward pull called a suction force
this force pulls the water from roots upward through the stem branches and finally to the leaves
though transpiration causes loss of water from the plants still it is a necessary process for plants due to the following reasons  suction pull caused due to the evaporation of water helps to draw water to a great height in tall trees
 it produces a cooling effect on the plant and therefore prevents the plants from the damage caused by heat of sunlight
 it also helps in the transport of water and minerals to the leaves for performing photosynthesis in them
this happens because the heat from sun or moving air causes evaporation of water at a faster rate from the stomata
increases in the rate of transpiration cause an increased rate of absorption of water through the roots
therefore when a potted plant is kept under the moving fan the absorption of water through root will be increased along with the increased rate of evaporation
the new individuals produced are the copies of their parents
the process of reproduction is one of the important life processes and is essential for the continuity of the species
modes of reproduction the various parts of a plant such as roots stem and leaves each with a specific function is called vegetative parts
after a certain period of growth plants bear flowers
these flowers develop into fruits and seeds
in plants the reproductive parts are a flower which may have the male or female part or both the parts on the same flower
in plants there are two different methods of reproduction 
sexual reproduction the term ‘sexual’ means involving the fusion of sex cells or gametes while ‘asexual’ means without involving the fusion of gametes
in plants asexual reproduction results in the formation of offsprings or new plants without seeds or spores
asexual reproduction in plants occurs through the following methods 
vegetative propagation it is the formation of new plants from vegetative units of bud stem etc
these vegetative units are called propagules
vegetative reproduction may take place using various plant parts as given below i vegetative reproduction by stem the stems or branches of the plant normally bear buds in the axils
the buds that are present in the axil i
the point of attachment of leaf at the node develops into the shoot
these are called vegetative buds
the vegetative buds can give rise to a new plant
these buds consist of a short stem around which immature overlapping leaves are folded
these can produce a new plant by vegetative propagation
methods to vegetative reproduction by stem i new plants are obtained from the stem by the cutting method
in this method the small part of stem is removed by making a cut with a sharp knife
the stem cutting must have some buds on it
now the lower end of stem cutting is buried in the moist soil
the upper part of cutting having bud on it is kept above the soil
after few days this cutting develops new roots
the bud grows and produces a shoot i
rose champa grapes sugarcane banana cactus etc
ii another method of vegetative reproduction in stem is by layering
in this method a mature branch of parent plant is bent down and covered with soil
the tip of the plant is kept above the ground
the root develops from the branches and grows into a new plant
layering method is usually done in the plants that have long and slender branches e
iii grafting is also a method of vegetative reproduction in stems where new plants of desired qualities is developed from two different plants
the part that has shoot part is called scion and part having root is called stock
scion is attached to the stock which provides support and basic requirement for the development of plant e
ii vegetative reproduction by leaves when the leaf of some plants are hurried into the moist soil the cut edges or margins of leaves develop a new plants that resemble to the parent e
bryopbyllum or sprout leaf plant
iii vegetative reproduction by roots and bulbs in some plants like sweet potato dahlia etc a new plant develops through their roots and bulbs
each detached part can grow into a new plant
advantages of vegetative propagation  plants produced with vegetative reproduction takes less time to grow and bear flower and fruits earlier than those produced from seeds
 the new plants are the exact copies of parent plant because they are produced from a single parent
budding in this process a daughter individual is formed from a small projection on parent body called a bud
most of the fungi-like yeast reproduce by budding
yeast grow and multiply in every few hours if provided with sufficient nutrients and favourable condition
fragmentation some algae spirogyra that are present in waterbodies reproduce by fragmentation
in this- method the body of the parent breaks into small pieces called fragments and each fragment grows up to become a new plant
fragmentation of parent body occurs when they are matured
if water and nutrient are available the algae will grow and multiply rapidly by fragmentation
if this process continues it will cover a large area in a very short period of time
spore formation some fungus like bread mould reproduces asexually by spore formation
spores present in the air are the small spherical bodies having a thick protective wall that protects them from unfavourable conditions
when favourable conditions arrive the spores burst and germinate to develop into new plants
spores are very light asexually reproducing bodies which can be carried over a long distance by air or wind
some other plants like mosses and ferns also reproduce by spore formation in the underside of their leaves
sexual reproduction flowers are the reproductive part of a plant
they help the plants in sexual reproduction and producing fruits and seeds
in sexual reproduction a male cell is produced by the male part of a flower which fuses with a female cell produced by the female part of the flower
these cells are called gametes which when combined form a zygote by the process called fertilisation
parts of a flower the main parts of a flower are i sepals these are the green leaf-like outermost circle of the flower
all the sepals are together referred to as calyx
the function of the calyx is to protect the flower when it is in bud form
these lie inside the sepals
all the petals are together referred to as corolla
these are scented and attract insects for pollination
these are the little stalks with swollen top and lies inside the ring of petals
the stamen is made up of two parts i
the stalk of stamen is called filament and the swollen top of stamen is called anther
the anther contains the pollen grain which have male gamete in it
pollen grains are exposed when the anther ripens and splits
these appear as the yellow powder like substance which is sticky in nature
flowers usually have a number of stamens in it
iv pistil it is the female reproductive part of a flower that lies in the centre of a flower
these are a flask-shaped structure which is made up of three parts i
the top part of the pistil is called stigma
it receives the pollen grains from the anther during pollination
the middle part of the pistil is tube-like structure called style which connects stigma to the ovary
the swollen bottom part at the base of pistil is called ovary
the ovary makes ovules and stores them
these ovules contain the female sex cells also called an egg cell
it is the female gamete of flower
the pistil is surrounded by several stamens
the base of the flower on which all the parts of the flower are attached is called receptacle
either male or female are called unisexual flowers
these are also called as an incomplete flower e
papaya watermelon corn cucumber etc
ii bisexual flower the flower that contains both reproductive parts i
male and female in a single flower are called a bisexual flower
these are also termed as hermaphrodites or complete flower e
function of a flower the function of a flower is to make male and female gametes and also to ensure that fertilisation would take place for the seed formation
during sexual reproduction male and female gametes fuse to form the zygote
pollination the transfer of pollen grains from the anther of a stamen to the stigma of a pistil is called pollination
pollination takes place in two different ways i self-pollination when the pollen grain from the anther of one flower reaches to the stigma of the same ‘ flower it is called self-pollination
self-pollination generally occurs in a bisexual flower
ii cross-pollination when the pollen grains from the anther of a flower or of a plant are transferred to the stigma of a flower of the same plant or that of a different plant of the same kind the process is called cross- pollination
agents of pollination the process of pollination is carried out by some external agencies like wind water insects birds etc
these are called agents of pollination
fertilisation the process in which the male gamete fuses with the female gamete to form a new cell called zygote is called fertilisation
when the pollens are deposited on the stigma of the pistol it begins to germinate
after some time a long pollen tube is developed from the pollen grain which passes through the style towards the female gametes in the ovary
the male gametes move down the pollen tube and the tube enters the ovule present inside the ovary
inside the ovary the male gametes fuse with the female gametes present in the ovule to form a fertilised egg cell which is called zygote
the zygote develops into an embryo which is a part of a seed that develops into a new plant
fruit and seed formation after the fertilisation the ovary grows into the fruit and the ovule develops into the seeds
the outer parts of the flower i
petals sepals and stamen become dry and fall off
stigma and style also fall off leaving ovary on the receptacle
the zygote inside the ovary gets its food from the ovule and grows by cell division to form an embryo
parts of the ovule develop into the seed covering or seed coat
fruits are the ripened ovary of a flower
some fruits are fleshy and juicy e
mango apple and orange while some are hard like almonds and walnuts
seed dispersal seeds are developed from the ovule
seeds contain an embryo enclosed in a protective seed coat
plants produce a large number of seeds
when these seeds fall down they start growing
if a large number of seeds falls on the same place they will not get enough space for water and light and will not develop into a healthy plant
thus the seeds are moved away by some external agencies to far off places
the process by which the seeds are scattered to different places far and wide from their parents is called dispersal
the seeds and fruits are dispersed away through various agencies like wind water birds and some animals
sometime seed dispersal takes place naturally by the explosion or bursting of fruits
seed dispersing agents wind water animals birds and humans are the dispersing agents of seeds
seeds of maple drumstick have wings seeds of madar or oak have hairs on them cottonseed also possess hairs on them while seeds of grasses orchids begonia are very small and light
these seeds can be easily carried away by the wind and dispersed away from their natural habitat
dispersal by water the seeds of some plants that have an outer fibrous or spongy covering are dispersed through water
they have the ability to float in the water and drift along with its flow e
seeds of water lily lotus chestnut singhara and coconut are dispersed through water
the coconut fruits have a fibrous outer coat which enables them to float in water and carried away by flowing water to far off places
dispersal by birds the birds eat fruits along with the seeds
these seeds have hard outer covering
the seeds are dispersed to some other place through the bird’s faeces
the digestive enzymes present in the digestive system of birds helps in dissolving the hard seed coat and when they are released or excreted along with the faeces they germinate e
neem seeds are dispersed by the bird’s faeces
dispersal by animals some seeds have hooks or spines which get attached to the fur or body of the grazing animals
when these animals move to a distant place the seeds get dispersed while animal rub their body surface e
fruit of xantbium and urena plants are covered by numerous hooks which attach to the animal’s fur and are dispersed with them
along with the fruits the seeds also get dispersed
dispersal by explosion or bursting of fruits sometimes fruits mature and a strain is produced in their walls
due to the explosion of fruit the seeds are thrown away from the plant with a great force in all direction e
castor plant burst suddenly with a jerk and scatter the seeds far away from the parent plant
similarly fruit of balsam is also dispersed through the explosion mechanism
benefits of seed dispersals  seed dispersal avoids overcrowding of young plants around their parent plants
 it helps in preventing competition between the plants and its own seedlings for sunlight water and minerals
 one of the benefits of seed dispersal is that it enables the plant to grow into new habitats for wider distribution and provides them with a better chance of survival
germination of seed a seed contains a plant embryo in a resting state which begin to grow only under favourable conditions
the process by which seeds begin to grow is called seed germination
it is the growth of a plant from its seed
when the seed germinates the seed coat splits and a tiny root called radicle grows downward and shoot called plumule starts growing upwards
this produces seedling of the plant
the seedling grows faster and ultimately forms a new plant
when the plant starts maturing it bears flower which again produces seed and fruits
this cycle continues to produce more offsprings for the preservation of a species
 are all in motion
when an object changes its position with time we often perceive an object to be in motion e
when the position of a car changes with time we say that the car is moving or the car is in motion
types of motion the motion of all the objects are not of the same type
there are four different types of motion shown by the different objects
rectilinear motion the motion possessed by the body moving along a straight line path is called rectilinear motion e
the motion of a train on a straight bridge
circular motion the motion possessed by a body when it moves along a circular path is called circular motion e
the motion of a child in a merry-go-round motion of the earth around the sun in a circular orbit
rotational motion the motion possessed by a body when it spins about a fixed axis is called rotational motion e
the motion of the earth about its axis spinning top the motion of blades of a fan
periodic motion the motion which repeats itself after regular intervals of time is called periodic motion e
the motion of the swing to and fro motion of a simple pendulum
if your school is at a distance of  km from your home and you want to go to school by bicycle then it may take about  min to reach the school and if you go to school by school bus then the same distance can be covered only in  min
it means that a bicycle takes a longer time than the bus
thus the most convenient way to determine which of the two objects is moving faster is to compare the distance moved by them in a unit time which is known as speed
speed the distance travelled by an object per unit time either in one hour in one minute or in one second is known as speed of the object
a slow moving object is said to have a low speed and a fast moving object is said to have high speed
so if we know the distance covered by two buses in one hour then we can answer which one is slower
therefore the formula for calculating the speed of an object can be given by speed = e
if a car travels a distance of  km in  h then the speed of this car is given by speed = =  kmh it shows that the car will travel a distance of  km in  h
it does not matter if a car seldom moves with a constant speed for one hour as it starts moving slowly and then picks up speed
so when we say that the car is moving with a speed of  kmh then we do not bother whether the car has been moving with a constant speed or not during that hour
therefore the speed calculated here is the average speed of the car
non-uniform and uniform motions in everyday life we seldom find objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for iong durations of time
if the speed of an object moving along a straight line beeps changing its motion is said to be non- uniform motion
in this case the average speed is the same as the actual speed
units of speed the unit of speed depends upon the unit of distance and the unit of time used
 the metre is the standard unit of distance and second is the standard unit of time
so the standard unit of speed is metre per second ms
 the large values of speed are expressed in kilometre per hour kmh and in this case the distance travelled is measured in terms of kilometre and time taken is measured in an hour
 the small values of speed are expressed in centimetre per second cms and in this case the distance travelled is measured in terms of centimetre and time taken is measured in second
if we have to compare the speeds of a number of objects then we must express the speeds of all those objects in the same unit
measurement of time a duration or moment in which things occur is known as time
with the help of clocks and watches we generally measure time
it is very difficult to think that how did the people in ancient time measure times as they did not have clocks or watches
in order to measure the time ancient people used some natural events which repeated regularly after fix time intervals e
they found that the sun rises every day in the morning
so the time between one sunrise and the next i was known as a day
in a similar manner time from one full moon to the next full moon was
a year was fixed as the time taken by the earth to complete one revolution of the sun
sundials water clocks and sand clocks are some examples of such devices
note i a sundial measures time by the position of the shadow cast by the sun
ii the device which uses the flow of sand from one glass bulb to another in order to measure time is known as a sand clock iii a device which uses the rate at which water drip from one vessel to another measure time interval is known as a water clock simple pendulum a simple pendulum consists of a small metal ball called bob which is suspended by a long thread from rigid support such that bob is free to swing back and forth
the to and fro motion of a simple pendulum is an example of periodic or oscillatory motion
galileo was the first person to study the motion of a pendulum
a pendulum completes every swing or every oscillation in exactly the same time provided its length should be kept constant
the pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob starting from its mean position f moves to d to e and back to f
the pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position d to the other extreme position e and come back to d
so the time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period
the time period of a pendulum depends on its length
the length of a pendulum is the length of thread from the point of suspension to the centre of the bob
he found that a pendulum of a given length tabes always the same time to complete one oscillation
this observation led to the development of pendulum clocks
winding clocks and wristwatches were refinements of the pendulum clocks
units of time second is the basic unit or standard unit of measuring time and it is represented by symbol s
the larger units of time are minute and hour
 h =  min and  min =  s different units of time are used depending on the need e
in order to express the longer time interval the bigger units of time are used i
 day =  h  month =  days and  year =  months note nowadays most clocks or watches have an electric circuit with one or more cells
these clocks are called quartz clocks
the time measured by quartz clocks is much more accurate than that by the clocks available earlier
measuring speed we have learnt how to measure distance and time we can calculate the speed of an object
now we should learn how to measure the speed by doing an activity
speedometer and odometer the speedometer is an instrument on a vehicle’s dashboard which indicates the speed of the vehicle when it is moving
this instrument tells us the speed of a running vehicle at that instant of time in kilometre per hour
a panel of instruments fitted on the top of a scooter or a motorcycle
in the same way metres can be seen on the dashboard of cars buses and other vehicles in addition to the speedometer there is another instrument in a vehicle called odometer
this instrument measures the distance in kilometres
usually a small rectangular window within speedometer dial with the symbol km as shown in the figure gives the metre odometer reading
graphical representation of motion by drawing the distance-time graph the motion of an object can be represented in diagram form
a distance-time graph represents how the distance travelled by a moving object changes with time
method to draw distance-time graph to draw a distance-time graph use a graph paper
for drawing the distance-time graph for a moving object we require the readings of distances travelled by the object and the corresponding time values which have been obtained experimentally
 now write time min on x-axis and distance km on the y-axis and also put arrows with them
 in this problem we have only small time values      and  min to represent
so the scale to be used for showing time can be  min =  cm
here we mark the time values      and  on the line ox as shown in the figure given as alongside
 again the distance values given in this problem are small      and  km
so the scale to be used for representing distance values on the graph can be  km =  cm
we now mark the distance values      and  on the line oy see figure
 we can see in the graph that the first reading given in this problem is time =  and distance = 
the point o called origin represents the  zero values both for time and distance
therefore at point o on graph paper time is  and distance is also 
the second reading is time =  min and distance =  km
 now the vertical line above the  min mark on the graph paper and horizontal line on the right side of  km mark on graph paper cross at point a see figure
so we put a pencil dot at point a
 in the same way the third fourth fifth and sixth readings of time and the corresponding readings of distance will give us points b c d and e on the graph paper which are marked as pencil dots see figure
 after joining the point o and the dots at point a b c d and e with a pencil line we will get a straight line graph oe see figure
so this is the required distance-time graph for the motion of the car
other types of graph we generally see while reading newspapers magazine etc
 that the present information is represented in various forms of graphs in order to make it interesting
these graphs generally bar graphs and pie chart as shown in the figure
a diagram which shows information as thin rectangles known as bars of different heights is known as a bar graph
in this graph the position and heights of the bars represent the values of the variable quantity about which information is being given
electricity has a very important role because it is used to run many electrical appliances like an electric bulb television a stereo system refrigerator washing machine computers etc
 and we cannot think our life without making use of electricity
electricity is produced at power stations from where it is brought to our homes through the thin wire and electric poles networks or underground cables or wires
here we can define the electric current as of the flow of electricity through a conductor wires cables
actually in everyday life the word electricity and electric current are used in the same sense
there is another source of electricity i
now in order to obtain electricity from a cell or battery we have to connect it into a circuit
so let us study about the electric circuit
electric circuits a continuous conducting path consisting of wires bulb switch etc
 between the two terminals of a cell or battery along with an electric current flows is known as an electric circuit
take a cell having a positive terminal + and a negative terminal -
now try to connect the positive terminal of the cell to one end of the switch with a piece of copper wire and other ends of the switch to one end of bulb holder with another piece of copper wire
circuit diagram a circuit diagram tells us how the various components in an electric circuit have been connected by using the electrical symbols of the components
i when the bulb glows in an electric circuit when the switch is closed then the switch is said to be in the on position
and when the switch in a circuit is open then the switch is said to be in the off position
so in an electric circuit a bulb lights up only when the switch is in the on position and at that time we can say that the electric circuit is complete because the current flows throughout the circuit instantly as shown in the figure electric circuit ii when the bulb does not glow while checking the circuit notice that sometimes the bulb does not glow even when the switch is in the on position
this condition can occur only if the bulb gets fused i
it is a difficult and time-consuming job to draw the electric circuit by making the actual drawings of cell battery switch bulb etc
 with the help of symbols which are easy to draw
torches radio electric clocks and watches toys etc
 is an electric cell but sometimes a single cell is not sufficient to run many devices as they require high voltage to run all these appliances
the cell provides much less electricity as compared to that provided by the electric supply line e
in the case a single electric cell which provides only 
 v of electricity whereas electricity from the power station is supplied to our home at very high voltage of  v
combination of electric cells since the higher voltage can be obtained by combining a number of cells in series
so when the positive terminal of one cell is joined with the negative terminal of the other cell then the cells are said to be joined in series as shown in figure given below
so a battery can be defined as the group of cells joined together in the series e
in a torch the cells are placed one after the other
but in many devices cells are not placed one after the other e
in a tv remote control the two cells are placed side by side or parallel to each other instead of single one
so two or more cells connected in side by side manner are said to be joined in parallel
this combination is also known as battery
if we combine two cells by keeping the positive terminal of one cell in contact with the positive terminal of the other cell or negative terminal of one cell in contact with the negative terminal of the other cell then the battery obtained will not work
 are also made of cells
there is a special feature of car battery is that its cells can be recharged
ordinary cells however cannot be recharged
connection of cellsbattery ‘+’ and ‘-‘ symbols are printed in the battery in order to have an exact placement of the cells in their respective battery compartment
 the switch or key can be placed anywhere in the circuit
 the circuit is complete and it is said to be closed only when the switch is on
 the circuit is incomplete and it is said to be open only when the switch is off
there is a thin wire in the bulb called filament which glows when an electric current passes through it
so if the bulb gets fused then its filament gets broken
note never touch a lighted electric bulb connected to the mains as it may be very hot and can damage your hands
heating effect of electric current production of heat in an electric device due to the flow of electric current is called the heating effect of electric current
we have seen an electric heater used for cooking an electric bulb or room heater
so when these appliances are switched on after connecting to the electric supply then their elements become red hot and release the heat
this happens due to the heating effect of electric current
the degree to which a material opposes the passage of current through itself is known as its resistance
actually when an electric current passes through a high resistance wire the electric energy gets converted into heat energy and this heat energy heats up the wire
element all electrical heating devices consist of a coil of wire called an element
there are some electric appliances such as immersion heaters hotplates irons geysers electric kettles hair dryers etc
 which have elements inside them
factors on which the heating effect of current depends there are two factors on which the heating effect of current depends i resistance of wire greater the resistance of a wire greater will be the heat produced in it by a given current e
if we choose two wires one of copper and other is nichrome of equal length and equal thickness and pass them the equal amount of current through them for the same duration then we will notice that nichrome wire will become hotter in comparison to the copper wire
it is due to the reason that the resistance of nichrome wire is more than that of the copper wire
that is why the nichrome wire is used to make heating elements of electric heating appliances such as electric room heater electric iron etc
the resistance of a wire depends on the material of the wire length of wire and thickness of the wire
ii magnitude of current passed through a given wire if the magnitude of current passed through a given wire is greater then the heat produced in it will also be greater e
if a normal amount of current flows through the copper wires of household electric wiring then the wires do not become much hot but if a large current flows in the same wiring accidentally then the wires become extremely hot and a fire may be started
applications of the heating effect of current some of the important applications of heating effect of electric current are  for the production of light the heating effect of electric current is utilised in the electric bulbs
 for the working of electrical heating appliances such as water heater electric room heater electric iron etc
 the heating effect of electric current is utilised
compact fluorescent lamps cfls an electric bulb is basically used for producing light but it also releases the heat which is not desirable because a major part of the electricity consumed by the filament of a bulb is converted into heat and results in the wastage of electricity
so this wastage can be decreased by using fluorescent tube light or cfls as shown in the figure in place of the bulbs
however before purchasing bulbs tubes orcfl’s we should look for the isi marl isi- bureau of indian standard
it is because the isi mark ensures that the appliance is safe and wastage of energy is minimum
electric fuse a safety device which works on the heating effect of current and prevents electric fires or damage to electrical appliances due to excessive flow of current is known as the fuse
this safety device consists of a short length of a thin wire of tin plated copper having a low melting point and this wire has a much greater resistance than the rest of the electric wiring in the house
this prevents fire in the house and also the damage of various electrical appliances like refrigerator fans tube lights tv etc
when a fuse gets blown breaks a new fuse has to be fitted in its place in order to restore the electricity supply in the household circuit
note we should not use a thick wire as a fuse wire because it will have low resistance and thus it will not get heated to its melting point ‘ when a large current passes through it
cause of large current flow in household electric wiring an extremely large current can flow in the household electric wiring circuits under two circumstances overloading and short circuit
we might have read reports in the newspaper about fires caused by short circuits and overloading
now let’s study these two terms
overloading it is a situation when too many electrical appliances are connected to a single socket they draw an extremely large amount of current from the household circuit
the flow of large current due to overloading may heat the copper wires of household wiring to a very high temperature and fire may be started
one insulated wire is called live wire and the other insulated wire is called neutral wire and both these wires are necessary for the working of an electrical appliance say an electric iron
so if in case the plastic insulation of the live wire and the neutral wire gets worn due to wear and tear then the two naked wires touch each other
so this touching of live wire and neutral wire directly is known as a short circuit
due to which a large current flows through the household wiring and this large’ current may heat the wires to a dangerously high temperature and a fire may be started
note always use proper fuses which have been specified for particular applications carrying isi mark never use just any wire or strip of metal in place of a fuse
miniature circuit breakers mcbs this ore increasingly being used these days in place of fuses
mcb does not work on the heating effect of current as it works on the magnetic effect of current
these switches outomaticouy turn off when the current in a circuit exceeds the safe limit
we turn them on and the circuit ¡s once again completed
magnetic effect of electric current if the electric current passes through a wire then the current carrying wire behaves like a magnet
this phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of current
it was discovered by a scientist hans christian oersted who found that when an electric current is passed in a wire then the compass needle placed near it got deflected from its usual north-south position
the magnetic effect is increased only if we use a long coil of wire instead of a straight wire
even further the magnetic effect is increased if the coil of wire is wound around an iron rod and then current is passed through it
electromagnets it is a magnet made by using electric current
an electromagnet works on the magnetic effect of current
an electromagnet consists of a coil of insulated wire wrapped around a piece of iron which is magnetised only when an electric current is passed through the coil
this magnet consists of a long coil of insulated copper wire wound around an iron rod and when the two ends of the coil get connected to a cell then a current passes through the coil and produces a magnetic effect
the magnetic effect magnetises the iron rod
in this way the iron rod becomes an electromagnet
the magnetism of an electromagnet remains as long as the current is flowing in its coil
so if we switch off the current in the coil then all the magnetism of the iron rod disappear and it will no longer behave like a magnet
there are two factors through which an electromagnet can be made stronger i
 by increasing the amount of current used in the coil
 by increasing the number of turns forming the coil
uses of electromagnets  these magnets are used in electrical appliances such as an electric bell electric fan electric motor
 for deflecting electron beam of the picture tube of tv electromagnets are used
 for the magnetic separation of iron ores from the earthly substances electromagnets are used
 for preparing strong permanent magnets electromagnets are used
advantages of electromagnets over permanent magnets an electromagnet is a temporary form of the magnet because its magnetism is only for the duration of current flowing in its coil
actually an electromagnet is better than a permanent magnet in many respects
there are some of the advantages of the electromagnets over the permanent magnets which are stated as follows  the magnetism of an electromagnet can be switched on or switched off as desired
while it is not possible with a permanent magnet
 by increasing the number of turns in the coil and by increasing the current passing through the coil an electromagnet can be made very strong
on the other hand a permanent magnet cannot be made so strong
electric bell an electric bell works on the magnetic effect of current
it has an electromagnet in it
let us study its construction and working as well
construction of electric bell the electric bell has a u-shaped electromagnet
there is a small iron bar called armature which is h^d in front of the poles of the electromagnet
the lower end of the iron bar is attached to a flat spring and the flat spring is itself fixed to a metal bracket
the upper end of the iron bar has a clapper attach to it
a metal gong is fixed near the clapper
working of electric bell in order to ring the bell first of all we press the push button switch in order to ring the bell
the electromagnet attracts the iron armature towards itself
so as the armature moves towards the poles of the electromagnet the clapper attached to it strikes the gong and produces a ringing sound
it implies that the bell rings
when the armature moves towards the magnet its contact with the contact screw is broken
due to this the electric circuit breaks and no current flows in the electromagnet coil
the electromagnet loses its magnetism for a moment and the armature is no longer attracted by it
the flat spring brings back the iron armature to its original position and the clapper also moves away from the gong
as soon as the armature comes back and touches the contact screw the circuit is completed and current starts flowing in the electromagnet coil again
the electromagnet attracts the iron armature once again and the clapper strikes the gong again producing a ringing sound
due to this the armature vibrates forwards and backwards rapidly each time making the clapper strike the gong
thus the clapper strikes the gong rapidly producing an almost continuous sound
sometimes we are unable to see anything in a dark room but on lighting up the room we are able to see the things in the room
since it is an obvious question arising that what makes thing visible
so its answer is light
light is a form of energy which enables us to see objects from where it comes or reflected
we can detect light with our eyes
light travelling along a straight line by seeing the phenomena around us like a beam of sunlight enters a room through a narrow opening or a hole and beams of light coming out from the headlamps of cars scooters engines torch etc
from the above examples we can conclude that light travels along a straight line
reflection of light there are some certain situations in which a mirror or shiny surfaces like stainless steel plate shining steel spoon act as a mirror can change the direction of light that falls on it
so this process of change in direction of light by a mirror is called a reflection of light
the surface of the water can also act as a mirror and can also change the path of light and that is why we see the reflection of trees or buildings in the water
image of an object generally when we look into a mirror then we see our face
actually what we see in the mirror it is exactly a reflection of our face hence it is known as an image of our face
in this case our face is the object and what we see in the mirror is its image
the image of our face appears to be situated behind the mirror
there are two types of images real image it is an image which can be obtained on a screen e
the image formed on a cinema screen
when the light rays coming from an object actually meet at a point after reflection from the mirror then it results in the formation of a real image
virtual image it is an image which cannot be obtained on a screen e
image formed by a plane mirror
when the light rays coming from an object appear to meet after reflection from the mirror then it results in the formation of virtual image
it is not possible to form a virtual image on the screen because light rays actually do not pass the screen or cannot be received on a screen
characteristics of the images formed by a plane mirror now we will describe the various characteristics of the images formed in a plane mirror by taking the example of the image of the candle
i when we see the mirror the image of candle appears to be formed behind the mirror
ii now put a vertical screen behind the plane mirror where the image of candle appears to be situated then we will notice that the image of candle cannot be formed on the screen
even if the screen is placed in front of the plane mirror then the image of candle cannot be formed on the screen
since the image of candle formed in the plane mirror cannot be formed on a screen which means that the image of candle in the plane mirror is a virtual image
iii if we see the figure then we will find that the length and breadth of the image of the candle and its flame to be the same as that of the original candle and its flame
the image of candle in the plane mirror is of the same size as the original candle
so the top of the candle remains at the top in the image
in the same way the bottom of candle remains at the bottom in an image
such an image is called an erect image or upright image
therefore the image formed by a plane mirror is erect
side inversion right ⇔ left when we see our image in a plane mirror is it exactly like us there is an interesting difference between us and our image
let us find out this difference with the help of an example
if we stand in front of a plane mirror and lift our right hand then we see our image lift its left hand
and if we lift our left hand then the image appears to lift its right hand
this means that the right side of our body becomes the left side in the image while the left side of our body becomes the right side of the image
it appears as if our image has been ‘reversed side ways’ with respect to your body
the effect of reversing the sides of an object and its image is called lateral inversion
so we say that image formed in a plane mirror is laterally inverted
so we can understand why the word ambulance is written as dmajuma
when a driver of a vehicle ahead of an ambulance look in hisher rear view mirror then heshe can read ambulance written on it and give way to it
so it is the duty of everyone of us to allow an ambulance to pass without blocking its way
spherical mirrors all the mirrors are not straight like plane mirror as some of the mirrors are curved mirror
there is a common example of a curved mirror i
a mirror whose reflecting surface is the part of a hollow sphere of glass is known as a spherical mirror
so these images are formed when light rays coming from the object fall on the mirror get reflected and converge or diverge
we can use a spoon in order to understand the image formation by a spherical mirror
the inside surface of a hollow sphere of glass is bent in or concave but the outside surface is bulging out or convex
so the spherical mirrors are of two types  concave mirror  convex mirror e
a shining steel spoon represents both a convex mirror as well as a concave mirror
as the front side or inner side of a spoon is bent inward so the front side of a shining spoon represents a concave mirror while the back side or outer side of a spoon is bulging outward so the back side of a shining spoon represents a convex mirror as shown in figure
concave mirror converging mirror the mirror whose reflecting surface is concave and polished surface is convex is called a concave mirror
the concave mirror reflects the parallel rays of light in such a way that after reflection all the rays converge or meet at one point called focus in front of the mirror
since a concave mirror converges a beam of parallel light rays
image formed by a concave mirror when the object is far off a concave mirror forms a real image of the sun
we can understand the formation of the image by a concave mirror when the object is far off by an activity
therefore we can conclude that the image formed by a concave mirror is much smaller than the object highly diminished and real because it can be obtained on a sheet of paper which is a kind of screen
so when an object is placed at a far off distance front a concave mirror then image formed by a concave mirror is  real  inverted  much smaller than the object
image formed by a concave mirror when the object is placed close to concave mirror let us perform an activity to understand the formation of image by a concave mirror when the object is placed close to the concave mirror
since the image can be observed only by looking into the concave mirror and cannot be formed on the screen therefore the image is virtual
if we look at the image in the concave mirror we find it to be the same side up as the candle so the image is erect
therefore the image is larger than the object enlarged or magnified
hence we can conclude that when an object is placed close to a concave mirror the image formed by the concave mirror is  virtual  erect  larger than the object enlarged or magnified
uses of concave mirrors  to see the large image of teeth of a patient concave mirrors are used by the dentist
 in torches headlights of vehicles and searchlights to get a strong straight beam of light etc
 concave mirrors are used as reflectors
 to see a large image of the face then concave mirrors are used as shaving mirrors
convex mirror diverging mirror the mirror whose reflecting surface is bulging or convex polished surface is concave is called the convex mirror
after reflection from the convex mirror the parallel rays of light are spreading out
when the parallel rays of light spread out we can say that the rays of light are diverging
since a convex mirror diverges a beam of parallel light rays therefore it is also known as a diverging mirror
image formed by a convex mirror let us perform an activity to understand the formation of an image by a convex mirror
the image of the candle can be seen only by looking into the convex mirror and cannot be formed on a screen
it is a virtual image
if we look at the image in the convex mirror we will find that it is the same side up as the candle
so the image is erect
and if we compare the size of the candle and its image the image appears to be smaller
therefore the image is smaller in size than the object or diminished
even if we change the distance of candle object from the convex mirror we will notice that in every case the image of the candle formed by the convex mirror remains virtual erect and smaller in size than the candle
so we can conclude that whatever be the distance of the object from a convex mirror the image formed by a convex mirror is always  virtual  erect and  smaller than the object or diminished
uses of convex mirrors  to see the traffic at the rear side or backside on the road convex mirrors are used as rear view mirrors or side view mirrors in vehicles such as cars scooters buses etc
 big convex mirrors are used as shop security mirrors
by installing a convex mirror in the shop the shop owner can keep an eye on the customers
image formed by lenses since a lens is a piece of transparent glass bound by the two spherical surfaces
lenses are transparent so that light can pass through lenses
convex lens converging lens the convex lens is the lens which is thicker in the middle than at the edges
a beam of parallel rays of light falls on a convex lens from the left side
after passing through the convex lens the beam of parallel rays of light converges at a point as shown in the figure given below
hence a convex lens is a converging lens
image formed by a convex lens the nature and size of the image formed by a convex lens depend on the distance of the object from the convex lens
thus we can conclude that when an object is placed at a far off distance from a convex lens then the image formed by the convex lens is real inverted and much smaller than the object or highly diminished
so is it possible to get in any position of the object for which image was erect and magnified yes it is possible when the candle is placed very close to the convex lens
uses of convex lenses  convex lenses are used as a magnifying glass
 in the manufacturing of spectacles camera microscope telescope and binoculars convex lenses are used
concave lens diverging lens a concave lens is a lens which is thinner in the middle than at the edge
a parallel beam of light falls on a concave lens as shown in the figure
after passing through the concave lens the rays of light are diverging or spreading out
since a concave lens diverges light rays falling on it therefore it is also called a diverging lens
image formed by a concave lens in the case of a convex lens we have studied that the nature of image formed depends on the distance of the object from the convex lens
but this is not followed in the case of a concave lens
let us perform an activity to understand the formation of an image by a concave lens
 concave lenses are used in making spectacles
sunlight white or coloured we might have noticed a rainbow which usually appears after the rain when the sun is low in the sky
an arc of seven colours seen in the sky is known as the rainbow
the seven colours of a rainbow are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
we might also have seen that when we blow soap bubbles they appear colourful
similarly when light is reflecting from the surface of a compact disc cd we can see many colours
the rainbow is produced by the dispersion of sunlight by tiny raindrops suspended in the atmosphere
dispersion of light in the year  newton discovered by his experiments with glass prisms that white light like sunlight consists of a mixture of lights of seven colours
newton found that if a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism then the white light splits to form a band of seven colours on a white screen
the band of seven colours formed on a white screen when a beam of white light is passed through a glass prism is known as a spectrum of white light
the seven colours of the spectrum are red orange yellow green blue indigo and violet
the formation of a spectrum of seven colours indicates that white light is a mixture of seven colours
white light can be sunlight
so now we can say that sunlight consists of seven colours
we can mix these colours to get white light
this can be done by using newton’s disc let us try this
water is essential for the existence of all forms of life
nd march is celebrated as world water day to attract the attention of everybody towards the importance of conserving water
the year  was recognised as ‘international year of freshwater’
by doing such activities we spread the message of conservation of natural resources of water and make people understand that there will be no life without water on the earth
we also believe that “if you have water you can think of the future”
before we discuss why water is getting scarce we must know how much water is available for use on our planet
water available for use if we take a picture of earth from outer space it appears blue because of presence of water in the form of sea and ocean
about % of surface of the earth is covered with water
of the total water present on earth 
% is in the seas and oceans but it is not fit for human consumption
freshwater in a usable form is present in just a small fraction of all water present on the earth
most of us assume that there is plenty of water all over the earth
but infact this all water is not suitable for human consumption not even fit for plants and other forms of life
different forms of water water exists in three forms
these are the main sources of water on earth
 water liquid is present in oceans lakes rivers and even underground water in the earth’s upper layers
 clouds gas are found in the form of water vapour present in the atmosphere
on condensation it turns into droplets and precipitates on earth’s surface in the form of rain
the continuous recycling of these forms of water takes place and the amount of water on the earth is maintained of constant
most of the urban areas have a system of water supply whereas underdevelopedundeveloped areas depend on resources like rivers lakes ponds handpumps etc
groundwater as an important source of water the wells tubewells and handpumps are the main sources of water for many people
the water in these sources is the groundwater
it is the upper level of underground water which occupies all the spaces in the soil and rocks and form a water table as shown in the figure below the upper limit of groundwater is called water table
it represents the depth of water filled area at a given place
the water table rises and falls depending upon the amount of rainwater that seeps into the groundwater and how much groundwater is drawn out for irrigation and industry
the seeping down of rainwater into the groundwater is called infiltration
the groundwater thus gets recharged by this process
this is aquifer which contains the groundwater usable by tubewells and handpumps
these sources however have limited sources of water and may get exhausted if used excessively
depletion of water table water drawn from underground water gets replenished by seepage of rainwater
the water table does not get affected as long as we draw the same amount of water as is replenished by natural resources like rain
however there is a number of factors which cause depletion of water table at a very fast rate which is really a matter of concern for every one of us
increase in population industrial and agricultural activities are some common factors affecting water table
scanty rainfall deforestation and decrease in the effective area for seepage of water may also deplete the water table
increasing population as our population increases we need more water for drinking washing cooking and cleaning
we also need more number of houses offices shops and roads
this means more construction work and construction itself uses lots of water itself
most of the time it is the groundwater
besides this there is less open area which can seep in the rain water into the ground
so rise in population also increases use of water
this results in depletion of groundwater level to alarmingly low levels in many cities
increased industrialisation water is used by all industries
almost everything that we use needs water somewhere in its production process
the number of industries is increasing continuously
most of the water used in the industries is drawn from groundwater
this results in depletion of water
this puts more pressure to the agriculture practices
in our country farmers depend on rain canal water or groundwater for irrigation
canals are found only at a few places
since rain is often erratic canals also suffer frequently from lack of water
therefore farmers have to use groundwater for irrigation
this results in depletion of groundwater
deforestation large scale deforestation has occurred to accommodate the growing population to grow food for them and to provide space for industries
overgrazing by our animals has also destroyed large amount of vegetation
the green coverage of vegetation slows down the flow of water on land and increases the absorption of water by the soil
cutting down of trees and vegetation therefore interferes with the natural processes by which seepage takes place and the groundwater is recharged and causes depletion of water
distribution of water the distribution of water over the globe is quite uneven due to the number of factors
some places have a good amount of rain
on the other hand these are deserts which have scanty rainfall
some regions have excessive rains which cause floods while some others have very little rainfall which causes drought
india is a vast country and the rainfall is not the same everywhere
therefore some regions in our country may have floods while others may suffer from droughts at the same time
water resources in india india receives a lot of precipitation rain and snow in comparison to the rest of the world
the average annual precipitation in india is  mm as compared to the world’s average of  mm
government of india copyright 
based upon survey of india map with the permission of the surveyor general of india
the territorial waters of india extend into the sea to a distance of twelve nautical miles measured from the appropriate baseline
the external boundaries and coastlines of india agree with the recordmaster copy certified by survey of india
it is a subset of water cycle management
water supply pipes leaking and a lot of water gushing out of the pipes are the wastage of water
it is the responsibility of the civic authorities to prevent such wastage of precious water
mismanagement or wastage may also take place at the level of individuals also
all of us knowingly or unknowingly waste water we should also take care for it
some of the steps which can be taken for the proper management of water are given below 
rainwater harvesting most of the rainwater just flows away
this can be skillfully used to recharge the groundwater
the modern buildings of schools offices homes can install a rainwater harvesting system so as to store rainwater in their own premises for future use
a case study bhujpur in the kutch area of gujarat has a very erratic rainfall
the only source of freshwater lies underground because rivers in this area do not have water throughout the year
over the years demand for water has grown
as a result the water table has gone down alarmingly
eighteen chech-dams were built on ruhmavati river and its tributaries where water percolates through the soil and recharge the aquifers
^ according to farmers the wells have water now and the water that flowed into the sea and was wasted has become available for irrigation
bawris the bawris is age old method of collecting water
these structures are still found in old buildings palaces and forts
with time the bawris fell into disuse and garbage started piling in these reservoirs
however because of the acute shortage of water the bawris are being revived
today the situation is that inspite of scanty rains those places are managing their water needs well
drip irrigation it is a method of watering plants by use of narrow tubings which deliver water directly to the base of a plant
this minimises wastage of water
if any pipeline and tap water is leaking there immediately report to authorities like ‘jal board’ in delhi to prevent water loss
educate people about water wise habits which can be developed gradually and will last life long once developed
water-wise habits  turn off the tap while brushing shaving and washing hand
this will check the excess flow of water into drains
 use mug and water in the bucket for bathing instead of using showers
 mop the floor instead of washing
 irrigate potted plants with used water for washing rice and dal in the kitchen while cooking
 check no tap or pipe is leaking
effect of water scarcity on plants we grow many plants in pots in our homes
these are called potted plants
the potted plants are watered regularly
if the potted plants are not watered even for a few days the plants will ‘wilt’ become limp and ultimately ‘dry up’
if potted plants are not given water for a considerable time they will die
thus sufficient water is essential for maintaining the life of plants
the various effects of water scarcity on plants are  water scarcity will affect nutrient uptake from soil by the plants
 the rate of photosynthesis will decline so oxygen evolved will be less
 rate of transpiration will also decline so water vapours released in the atmosphere by transpiration will be less it will disturb the water cycle
so in brief we can say the shortage of water will lead to a shortage of food shortage of oxygen and shortage of rain also
it met all our requirements for leading a normal life at that time
now-a-days we live in cities and towns far off from forests so we really do not know the importance of forests in our life
it is a natural renewable resource a habitat home to many forms of wildlife like bear bison jackal deer porcupine elephant etc
many trees like sal teak semal sheesham neem palash fig khair amla bamboo kachnar and many others are also found in the forests
the forest also contains insects butterflies honeybees and birds which help in palliation in the flowering plants of the forest in pollination
structure of a forest the plants trees shrubs and herbs make different layers in the forest which are described below 
canopy the uppermost branches and leaves of tall trees which act as a roof over the forest ground is called canopy
it is the highest layer of vegetation in the forest
the branch part of a tree above the stem is known as the crown of the tree
understorey the different horizontal layers formed due to different types of crowns in the forest is called understorey
ii shrub layer it has many shrubs and bushes of approximately - metres of height from the forest floor
it makes dense layer at some places of forest where enough sunlight is present
iii herb layer just below the shrub layer occurs the herb layer of plants
it is the lowest layer of vegetation in the forest having leafy plants
most of the plants in herb layer have short lifespan
iv forest floor plants found here are as small as mosses liverworts lichens
it has many kinds of insects worms toad stool etc
most of the forest floor is covered with dead and decaying plant matter and animal waste
the non-living environment of the forest provides nutrients water and carbon dioxide for the growth of the plants
they are called producers of food
animals forests have many animals and they are called consumers of food
the animals which eat only plantstheir parts are called herbivores herb eating whereas flesh-eating animals are called carnivores
they feed on dead plants and animals and thus are called saprotrophs
they play a very important role in sustaining the forests
scavengers those animals which eat dead animals are called scavengers e
vultures crows jackals hyena some insects ants beetles termites woodlice maggots millipedes and earthworms etc
scavengers are the cleaning agents of our environment
importance of forests the forests provide us with a large number of products
they also purify air and water quality and maintain soil moisture and climate
so they are called lifeline
forests provide many useful products the various things which are obtained from the forests are called forest products
forests give us a large number of useful products
some of the important products which we get from the forests are wood honey gum sealing wax or lac catechu kattha fruits oils spices natural rubber cork dyes medicinal plants and fodder for cattle
perhaps the most important product obtained from forests is the wood which is obtained by cutting down the forest trees
the wood obtained from forests is used for a large number of purposes in our day-to-day life
forests maintain balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide plants in the forest release oxygen during photosynthesis
this provides all animals including us with oxygen to breathe and helps to maintain the ratio of oxygen to carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
that is why forests are called green lungs
plants in the forest intake carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis
hence they help to maintain the right amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
forests maintain water cycle the forest trees suck water from the soil through their roots and release water vapour into the air through transpiration
this water vapour helps in the formation of clouds and bring rain on the earth
thus forests bring sufficient rainfall on the earth
in fact about half the rain which falls in forest areas comes from the transpiration of forest trees themselves
in this way forests help in maintaining a perfect water cycle in nature and meet our freshwater requirements
forests prevent occurrence of flood the forest acts as a natural absorber of rainwater and allows it to seep
it helps to maintain the water table throughout the year
on the other hand if trees are not present rain hits the ground directly and may flood the area around it
heavy rain may also damage the soil
roots of trees normally bind the soil together but in their absence the soil is washed away or eroded
the different kinds of plants grow together in the forest making different levels of layers and habitat for wild animals
in the absence of plantstrees the soil will not hold water which will cause flood and erosion
forests provide habitat for wildlife the different types of vegetation present in a forest provide food and shelter to animals birds and insects which live in the forest
this makes a food chain
a typical chain in grassland is grass → deer → lion a typical food chain in a pond is algae → small fish → large fish flow of energy in a food chain the sun is the ultimate source of energy for everything on the planet
green plants or producers are able to harness the energy of the sun to make food
from the producers the energy goes to primary consumers herbivores and is then passed on to secondary consumers carnivores
dynamic living entity by harbouring greater variety of plants the forest provides great opportunities of food and habitat for the herbivores
larger number of herbivores means increased availability of food for a variety of carnivores
the wide variety of animals helps the forest to regenerate and grow
decomposers help in maintaining the supply of nutrients to the growing plants in the forest
therefore the forest is a dynamic living entity
there is a continuous interaction between soil water air plants and animals in a forest
forests can regenerate on their own the dead parts of trees and plants dead animals and animal wastes like animal dung or droppings keep on collecting on the forest floor
the hummus makes the forest soil fertile by providing the nutrients
the animals birds of forests wind and water disperse the seeds of trees and plants on the forest soil
these seeds obtain nutrients from the soil and germinate to form seedlings and ultimately grow to form the forest vegetation
forest conservation paper is made from wood pulp that is produced from the wood of forest trees
so to make paper many trees have to be cut down from the forests
 and send them to paper mills for recycling through a junk dealer kabaddi wala we will be able to save many forest trees from being cut down
some of the other ways to conserve forests are also given below  excessive cutting down of forest trees should not be allowed by the government to conserve forests
 more trees should be planted in the forest in place of cut down trees to conserve forests
 paper products such as old newspapers magazines books notebooks etc
 should be recycled to conserve forests
a large number of forest trees are being cut down every day to meet the various demands of the increasing population
following are the consequence if forests disappear  increase of the earth’s temperature if there are no trees and plants their will be no photosynthesis
so no c of the atmosphere will be used
this will increase the level of c resulting in the increase of earth’s temperature
 no food and shelter to wildlife in the absence of trees plants and animals will not get food and shelter
so this will disrupt the whole cycle of life and gradually life might disappear from the land area of the earth
 there will be more floods the trees plant roots help in holding the soil during rains and also soil is able to hold water
in the absence of trees the soil will not hold water which will cause floods
 deforestation endanger the environment the continuous deforestation is threatening the different form of life including human beings
so there is necessity to think and set to conserve forests
natural calamities like floods cyclones hail forms are more in the absence of trees and forest
people become homeless when such disaster occurs
we all use water and in that process of using we make it dirty
the water rich in a lather mixed with oil and other pollutants that go down the drains from sinks showers toilets laundries is dirty
we use water every day for drinking bathing washing clothes cooking food washing utensils flushing toilets mopping the floors etc
we cannot think of our life without water
we use lots of water daily which is passed on to the drainage system every day
water our lifeline water is needed by all forms of life
clean water is a basic need of human beings
unfortunately clean water is not available to a large segment of human populations
the water which is unfit for human consumption becomes the source of many water-borne diseases which ultimately lead to loss  of human life
it is estimated that one billion human beings do not get safe drinking water
so realising the urgency we celebrate nd march as world water day to bring awareness amongst people for safe water fit for human consumption
thus the water is cleaned by removing pollutants before it enters a waterbody or is reused
this process of wastewater treatment is commonly known as sewage treatment which takes place in several steps as discussed later
on the world water day i
 march  the general assembly of the united nations proclaimed the period - as the international decade for action on water for life
sewage it is wastewater released by homes industries agricultural fields and other human activities
it also includes rainwater that has run down the street during a storm or heavy rain and it is liquid waste
most of its water has dissolved and suspended impurities called contaminants
 the nutrients present in sewage are nitrogen and phosphorus
 the bacteria present in sewage include those bacteria which cause water-borne diseases such as cholera and typhoid
 the other microbes present in sewage are protozoa which cause a water-borne disease called dysentery
water freshens up an eventful journey in a house a public building generally there are two sets of pipes i
one set of pipes brings clean drinking water into the house and the other set of pipes takes away wastewater sewage from houses
for proper sanitation a well-maintained sewage system is required
sewerage system the pipes which carry away wastewater or sewage from houses and other buildings are buried under the ground
an underground pipe which carries away dirty drainage water and waste matter is called sewer
the provision of drainage at a place by laying sewers under the ground is called sewerage
manholes a manhole is a covered vertical hole in the ground pavement or road above the underground sewer pipeline through which a worker can go down up to the sewer pipes for inspection cleaning etc
manholes are provided at every - m distance in the main sewer pipeline
manholes are also provided at the junction of two or more sewers and at points where there is a change in the direction of the sewer line
treatment of polluted water perform the following activity
it will help you to understand the processes that take place at the wastewater treatment plant
wastewater treatment plant wwtp a place where wastewater or sewage from houses and other buildings is brought for processing is called wastewater treatment plant
treatment of wastewater involves physical biological and chemical processes depending on the nature of contaminants
physical process screening the bar screens first remove the large rubbish objects like rags sticks cans polybags napkins sanitary towels etc
in this sand and grit settle down slowly at the bottom of the tank as water passes slowly through this tank
the settled sand and impurities are removed from the tanks from time to time
biological process the first sedimentation tank is sloped towards the centre
solid like faeces settle at the bottom and is called sludge which is removed by a scraper
oils and grease float at the surface of the water are removed by a skimmer
the biogas produced by anaerobic bacteria in the process can be used as fuel or can be used to produce electricity
here water gets cleared of rubbage oil grease etc and we get clarified water which is sent to aeration tank now
in the aeration tank the watery waste already contains bacteria aerobic in it
the compressed air bubbles are passed through this waste to provide  to the bacteria to increase bacterial activity which ultimately digests human waste food waste soaps and other unwanted and harmful matter still remaining in the wastewater leaving behind fairly pure water
chemical process the water after aeration tank is allowed to stand in a second sedimentation tank
it is safe for human consumption but is disinfected by chlorine or ozone before distributing it
become an active citizen waste generation is a natural part of human activity but we can limit the type of waste and quantity of waste produced
often we have been repelled by an offensive smell
the sight of open drains is disgusting
the situation worsens in the rainy season when the drains start overflowing
we have to wade through the mud pools on the roads
most unhygienic and unsanitary conditions prevail
flies mosquitoes and other insects breed in it
we should be an enlightened citizen and approach the municipality or the gram panchayat
we should also insist that open drains should be covered
if the sewage of any particular house makes the neighbourhood dirty
we should request them to be more considerate about other’s health
note we should plant eucalyptus trees all along sewage ponds
these trees absorb all surplus wastewater rapidly and release pure water vapour into the atmosphere
better house keeping practices we must minimise and manage waste at our houses before its disposal in the following manner  cooking oil and fats should not be thrown down the drain
they can harden and block the pipes
in an open drain the fats clog the soil pores reducing its effectiveness in filtering water
throw oil and fats in the dustbin
 used tea leaves solid food remains soft toys cotton sanitary towels etc
 should also be thrown in the dustbin
these wastes choke the drains
they do not allow the free flow of oxygen
this hampers the degradation process
sanitation and disease contaminated water and poor sanitation practices are the major causes of the number of infectious diseases in our country
safe sewage disposal facilities are still not available at many cities and villages in india
so people go to open places and defecate
this causes the increase in insect- vector population which transmit diseases like cholera typhoid meningitis etc
untreated human excreta is a health hazard which causes soil pollution and water pollution also
the river water and groundwater are sources of water for drinking for many people
so the contaminated water can spread many diseases especially water-borne
vermi-processing toilets in the vermi-processing toilets human excreta is treated by earthworms in a pit
these are tow water use toilets for the safe processing of human
alternate arrangement for sewage disposal low cost outside the sewage disposal system has been developed to take care of places where there is no sewage system e
these are described below i septic tanks septic tank is a low-cost onsite sewage disposal system
septic tanks are suitable where there is no sewerage made
these tanks need cleaning every four to six months
a septic tank usually consists of a big covered underground tank made of concrete having an inlet pipe at one end and on outlet pipe at the other end
the toilet seat is connected to the inlet pipe of the septic tank
the solid part of excreta keeps on collecting at the bottom of the septic tank in the form of a sludge whereas watery waste remains above it
the digested solid waste keeps on depositing at the bottom of septic tank
the watery waste is also cleaned by anaerobic bacteria
the excess water goes out of the septic tank through the outlet pipe and get absorbed in soil
ii composting pits these are self-sustained human waste disposal units which is not connected to a sewer line or a septic tank
a composting toilet breaks down and dehydrates human waste to compost
iii chemical toilets these toilets have limited storage capacity for human waste and need to be emptied periodically
these are the toilets which use chemically treated reservoir located just below the toilet seats
the chemicals reduce the foul smell coming out of human excrete and carry out partial disinfection of human waste
a large number of people participate in them
in the same way railway stations bus depots airports hospitals are very busy places
thousands of people visit them daily which generate large amount of waste
it must be disposed of properly otherwise epidemics could break out
the government has laid down certain standards of sanitation but unfortunately they are not strictly enforced
we should not scatter litter anywhere
if there is no dustbin in sight we should carry the litter at home and throw it in the dustbin
conclusion we all have a role to play in keeping our environment clean and healthy
we must realise our responsibility in maintaining the water sources in a healthy state
adopting good sanitation practices should be our way of life
influence others with your energy ideas and optimum a lot con be done if people work together
there is great power in collective action
as an active citizen we have many responsibilities regarding sanitation
these can be listed as follows  to ensure that our surroundings are clean
 to ensure that the sewerage system in our house is properly managed
 if any leakage or an open drain in the sewerage system is present then it should be reported to the municipality or the gram panchayats to insist that the open drain must be covered properly and several air and water-borne diseases can be prevented
note mahatma gandhi said ‘no one needs to wait for anyone else to adopt a humane and enlightened course of action’
 plants can make their food themselves but animals including humans cannot
 we get our food from plants or animals or both
in our country three categories of crops are grown  kharif crops the crops which are grown in the rainy season i
 from june to september are called kharif crops
paddy maize soybean groundnut and cotton are kharif crops
 rabi crops the crops are grown in the winter season i
 from october to march are called rabi crops
examples of rabi crops are wheat gram pea mustard and linseed
 zaid crops or summer crops the crops grown in the summer season are  called zaid crops
moong muskmelon watermelon cucumber gourd and bitter gourd are examples of zaid crops
cultivation of crops involves the following activities  soil preparation it involves loosening and tilling of the soil i

 irrigation supply of water to crops at appropriate intervals is called irrigation
 protection from weeds weeds are the unwanted plants that grow along with the crops
its removal is a must for the better growth of the crops
these can be controlled by spraying certain chemicals called weedicides like  -d
 harvesting the cutting of the crop after it is mature is called harvesting
 storage if the crop grains are to be kept for a longer time they should be safe from moisture insects and rats
pests pests are the insects or rodents that destroy’much of our crop yield
thus it is necessary to save crops from pests
this implement is made of wood and drawn by a pair of bulls

they may be unicellular or multicellular
bacteria are also involved in the making of cheese pickles and many other food items
acetobacter aceti bacteria is used for the production of acetic acid from alcohol
yeast is used for commercial production of alcohol and wine by growing them on natural sugars present in grains like barley wheat rice and crushed fruit juices etc
they can fix atmospheric nitrogen from the air into the soil and increase soil fertility
specialized bacteria convert nitrates and nitrites present in the soil into nitrogen gas which is released in the atmosphere
common ailments like cold influenza flu and most coughs are caused by viruses
serious diseases like polio and chicken pox are also caused by viruses
diseases like dysentery and malaria are caused by protozoans
typhoid and tuberculosis tb are caused due to bacteria
some common diseases their modes of transmission and preventive measures are given below

these make the food poisonous and result in serious illness and even death
therefore they are called preservatives
heat and cold treatments also inhibit the growth of microbes
pasteurization of milk the milk is heated to °c for  seconds and then suddenly chilled and stored
such milk is referred to as
symbiotic bacterium rhizobium helps in the fixation of nitrogen with the root of the leguminous plant
the action of lighting also helps into the fixation of nitrogen
nitrogen cycle nitrogen from the atmosphere is converted into nitrogen compounds by some bacteria like rhizobium and blue-green algae present in the soil and also by lightning
on the other hand certain other bacteria present in the soil convert nitrogen compounds into nitrogen gas that is released to the atmosphere

oxygen in the air is essential for combustion
during the process of combustion heat and light are given out
ignition temperature is the lowest temperature at which a combustible substance catches fire
inflammable substances have very low ignition temperature
fire can be controlled by removing one or more requirements essential for producing fire
water is commonly used to control the fire
water cannot be used to control fires involving electrical equipment or oils
there are various types of combustions such as rapid combustion a combustion that takes place rapidlyhigh speed with the production of heat and light is called rapid combustion
spontaneous combustion a combustion in which a material suddenly bursts into flames without the application of any apparent cause is called spontaneous combustion
explosion the process of combustion in which a large number of gases are evolved with the production of a tremendous amount of heat light and sound is called an explosion

 non-luminous zone of flame it is the outer zone of flame that is faintly blue in colour and undergoes complete combustion of the substance
fuel is a substance which may be burnt to produce considerable heat without the formation of undesirable products
ideal fuel the fuel which fulfils all the requirements for a particular use is called an ideal fuel
the amount of heat energy produced on complete combustion of  kg of a fuel is called its calorific value
it is expressed in a unit called kilojoule per kg kjkg
unbumt carbon particles in the air are dangerous pollutants causing respiratory problems
incomplete combustion of fuel gives poisonous carbon monoxide gas
increased percentage of carbon dioxide gas in air is responsible for global warming
oxides of sulphur and nitrogen produced by the burning of coal diesel and petrol cause acid rain which is harmful for crops buildings and soil
structure of a flame a flame has three zones the outermost thin transparent faint bluish non-luminous region of complete combustion the middle bright luminous zone of partial combustion while the innermost is the coldest dark zone which consists of hot vapours
acid rain when the pollutants like sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides dissolve in rainwater it forms an acid

they are essential for the well being and survival of mankind
deforestation means clearing of forests and using that land for other purposes
trees in the forests are cut for some of the purposes mentioned below  procuring land for cultivation  building houses and factories  making furniture or using wood as fuel the increase in temperature on the earth disturbs the water cycle and may reduce rainfall
deforestation results in the conversion of fertile land into deserts because of less humus
wildlife sanctuary national park and biosphere reserve are names given to the areas meant for conservation and preservation of forest and wild animals
the plants and animals of a particular area are known as the flora and fauna of that area
endemic species are those species that are found only in a particular area and not anywhere else
the endangered species are those which are facing the danger of extinction because their numbers are diminishing
we should save reuse and recycle paper to save trees energy and water

hands feet legs heart kidney etc
bacteria pplo has the smallest cell size of 
ostrich egg has the largest cell size of  mm
the shape of cells varies from spherical cuboidal columnar to long and branched types
some cells have an irregular shape i
 amoeboid shape in case of amoeba
some of these are common to different cell types
nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear membrane
nucleus acts as a control centre for all the activities of the cell
nucleus contains some smaller spherical body i
 nucleolus and threadlike structure i
the chromosomes carry genes that help in inheritance or transfer of characters from parents to the offspring
nucleoplasm is the liquid material of the nucleus
 lacking a nuclear membrane eire called prokaryotic cells
plant cells differ from animal cells in having an additional layer around the cell membrane termed as the cell wall
 called plastids are found in the plant cells only
green plastids containing chlorophyll are called chloroplasts
plant cell has a big central vacuole unlike a number of small vacuoles in animal cells
cell membrane cell membrane is a membrane around the cell
it is also called the plasma membrane
cell wall is a hard and rigid covering of plasma membrane and found in plant cells only
chloroplasts are the green coloured plastids having chlorophyll a winch is essential for photosynthesis
chromosomes are a thread like structures found in the nucleus
 contains a well developed nucleus are called eukaryotes

nucleus is the denser region of the cell and may be present at the centre of the cell
plasma membrane is a membrane around the cell also called cell membrane
 bacteria and blue green algae
pseudopodia are the projections protruding out of the body of amoeba
these appear and disappear as amoeba moves
tissue a tissue is a group of similar cells performing a specific function
vacuoles are the empty or blank looking structures in the cytoplasm
it is an example of a single cell which can change its shape
modes of reproduction there are two modes by which animals reproduce
these are  sexual reproduction and  asexual reproduction
ova ovary produces females gametes called ova egg
uterus is the part of the female reproductive system where the development of the embryo takes place
both sperm and ova are single-celled structure
the fusion of the ovum and the sperm is called fertilisation
fertilisation which takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation
fertilisation which takes place outside the body of the female is called external fertilisation
during fertilisation the nuclei of the sperm n and the egg in are fused to form a single nucleus n
this fertilised egg is called zygote
the cells then begin to differentiate into various tissues
this developing structure is called an embryo
a zygote formation and development of an embryo from the zygote b ball of cells enlarged c embedding of the embryo in the uterus enlarged the embryo gets implanted within the wall of the uterus i
 endometrium for further development
the stage of the embryo in which all the body parts are identifiable is called a foetus
the animals which lay eggs are called oviparous animals
the transformation of larva into an adult through drastic changes is called metamorphosis
types of asexual reproduction in small animals like a hydra new individuals develop from buds
this method of asexual reproduction is called budding
bud a lateral outgrowth from the parent body that assumes the shape of parent
it ultimately gets detached and behaves as a new individual
this type of asexual reproduction is called binary fission
binary fission in binary fission a single-celled individual reproduces by dividing itself into two
eggs eggs or ova are female gametes
embryo zygote during its development divides repeatedly to form a ball of cells
this structure is called embryo
fertilization the fusion of ovum and the sperm is called fertilization
internal fertilisation fertilisation that takes place inside the female body is called internal fertilisation
this is observed in human beings and other animals such as cows and dogs
external fertilisation fertilisation that takes place outside the female body is called external fertilisation
this is common in aquatic animals such as frogs fish starfish etc
foetus it is the stage of embryo in which all the body parts are identifiable in its developmental stage
viviparous animals such as human beings cows and dogs which give birth to the young ones are called viviparous animals
oviparous animals such as hen frog and butterfly which lay eggs are called oviparous animals
tadpoles in the life process of a frog we find three distinct stages that is egg → tadpole → adult
these tadpoles get transformed into adults which are capable of jumping and swimming and are finally transformed into frog
• sexual reproduction the process of reproduction which results from the fusion of male and female gametes is called sexual reproduction
zygote the nuclei of spermn and eggn are fused during fertilization to form a single nucleus
egg after fertilization is called zygote
adolescence the term is manipulated from a latin word ‘adolescence’ meaning “to grow into maturity
” whenever a kid starts crossing the age of  or  there is a sudden spurt in growth
this shows that they boys and girls are no longer a child but are on the way to becoming an adult
humans become capable of reproduction after puberty sets in
between the ages of  years and  years children are called adolescents
hair grows at various places on the body
breasts develop in girls and the region below the waist becomes wider while facial hair moustache and beard appears in boys
voice of boys becomes hoarse as voice box enlarges during adolescence
children gain height weight and reach mental maturity and emotional maturity during adolescence
the onset of puberty and maturity from reproductive parts are controlled by hormones
hormones are the secretions from endocrine glands which pour them directly into the bloodstream
hormones of pituitary gland the pituitary gland also called master gland secretes hormones like growth hormone and the hormones that stimulate other glands such as the testes ovaries thyroids f and adrenals to secrete harmonies
for example pancreas secretes insulin the thyroid secretes thyroxine and adrenals secrete adrenalin
male and female hormones testosterone is the male hormone and estrogen the female hormone
the uterine wall in females i
 the endometrium prepares itself to receive the developing fertilised egg
chromosomes these are thread-like structures that are present inside the nucleus of a cell and meant for carrying information from one generation to the next generation
ductless glands a few glands such as sweat glands oil glands and salivary glands release their secretions through ducts
endocrine glands lack ducts and it releases hormones directly into the bloodstream
so they are also called ductless glands
menstruation if fertilisation does not occur in female the released egg and the thickened lining of the uterus along with its blood vessels are shed off
this causes bleeding in the female which is called menstruation
menopause at  to  years of age the menstrual cycle stops
stoppage of menstruation is termed as menopause
menarche the first menstrual flow begins at puberty and is termed menarche
adam’s apple this is the protruding part of the throat in boys which begin to grow at puberty

force arises due to the interaction between at least two objects
 if the two forces act in the opposite direction on an object the net force acting on it is the difference between the two forces
 in general more than one force may be acting on an object at any given point
however a force acting on an object is always the mean net force acting on it
two friends pushing a heavy load a in the same direction and b in the opposite direction a force can change the state of motion  a change in the speed of an object or the direction of its motion or both implies a change in its state of motion
 force acting on an object may bring a change in its state of motion or a change in its shape
the force exerted by a magnet is an example of a non-contact force

factors affecting friction  friction depends on the nature of surfaces in contact
 for a given pair of surfaces friction depends upon the state of smoothness or roughness of those surfaces
it is less for smooth surfaces
 friction is independent of the area of contact
 friction depends on how hard the two surfaces pressed together

these rays were positively charged radiations which led to the discovery of sub- atomic particle called proton
thomson discovered the sub-atomic particle—the electron with a negative charge
structure of an atom 
 some of the α-particles were deflected by the foil by small angles
 one out of  particles appeared to rebound
conclusions made by rutherford based on his observations  most of the space inside the atom is empty because a-particles passed through the gold foil
 very few particles were deflected from their path because +ve charge of the atom occupies a very little space
 a very small fraction of a-particles were rebounded back shows all + ve charge and mass of the gold atom is concentrated in a very small volume within an atom
 the radius of the nucleus calculated was  times less than the radius of the atom
nuclear model of an atom  centre → +ve charge → called nucleus
all mass resides in nucleus
 electrons → revolve around the nucleus in orbits
drawbacks of rutherford’s model of the atom when an electron undergoes acceleration it radiates energy
thus revolving electron would lose energy and finally fall into the nucleus
due to this atom should be highly unstable and hence matter would not exist in the form that we know
but we know that atoms are quite stable
bohr’s model of atom postulates of neil bohr  only special orbits known as discrete orbits of electrons are allowed inside the atom
 while revolving in discrete orbits the electrons do not radiate energy
these orbits are called energy levels
orbits or shells are represented by k l m n or the numbers n =     neutrons distribution of electrons in different orbits shells given by bohr and bury rules  maximum number of electrons present in a shell is given by n n = shell number e

a cell can independently perform all necessary activities to sustain life
hence cell is the basic unit of life
there are two types of cells plant cell and animal cell
plasmacell membrane this is the outermost covering of the cell that separates the contents of the cell from its external environment
the plasma membrane allows or permits the entry and exit of some materials in and out of the cell so the cell membrane is called a selectively permeable membrane
some substances like co or o gases can move across the cell membrane by a process called diffusion
the movement of water molecules liquid through such a selectively permeable membrane is called osmosis
osmosis is the passage of water from a region of high water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane to a region of low water concentration
if the medium surrounding the cell has a higher water concentration than the cell the cell will gain water by osmosis
such a solution is known as a hypotonic solution
if the medium has exactly the same water concentration as the cell there will be no net movement of water across the cell membrane
such a solution is known as an isotonic solution
if the medium has a lower water concentration then the cell will lose water by osmosis
such a solution is known as a hypertonic solution
the flexibility of cell membrane also enables the cell to engulf in food and other material from its external environment
such process is known as endocytosis
it is observed in amoeba
cell wall protective wall plants cells in addition to the plasma membrane have another rigid outer covering called cell wall
the cell wall lies outside the plasma membrane
the plant cell wall is mainly composed of cellulose
it is a complex substance and provides structural strength to plant cells
when a living plant loses water through osmosis there is shrinkage or contraction of contents of the cell away from cell wall
this phenomenon is known as plasmolysis
nucleus brain of a cell the nucleus has a double-layered covering called nuclear membrane
the nuclear membrane has pores which allow the transfer of material from inside the nucleus to its outside i
the nucleus contains chromosomes which are visible as rod-shaped structures only when the cell is about to divide

i endoplasmic reticulum er channels network for transport the er is a large network of membrane-bound tubes and sheets
it looks like long tubules or round or oblong bags
there are two types of er-rough endoplasmic reticulum rer and smooth endoplasmic reticulum ser
rer has particles called ribosomes attached to its surface
the ribosomes endoplasmic reticulum are the sites of protein manufacture
the ser helps in the manufacture of fat molecules or lipids important for cell function
some of these proteins and lipids help in building the cell membrane
this process is known as membrane biogenesis
some other proteins and lipids function as enzymes and hormones
the er also functions as a cytoplasmic framework providing a surface for some of the biochemical activities of the cell
ii golgi apparatus packaging the golgi apparatus first described by camillo golgi consists of a system of membrane-bound vesicles arranged approximately parallel to each other in stacks called cisterns
the material synthesised near the er is packaged and dispatched to various targets inside and outside the cell through the golgi apparatus
it’s function include the storage modification and packages of products in vesicles
in some cases complex sugar may be made from simple sugar in the golgi apparatus
it is also involved in the formation of lysosomes
iii lysosomes suichge bags cleanliness of cell lysosomes are a kind of waste dispatch and disposal system of the cell
under abnormal condition when the cell gets damaged lysosomes may burst and the enzymes digest their own cell
therefore they are also known as “suicide bags” iv mitochondria powerhouse energy provider mitochondria are known as powerhouses of the cell
the energy required for various chemical activities needed for life is released by mitochondria in the form of atp adenosine triphosphate molecules
mitochondria have two membrane coverings instead of just one
the outer membrane is very porous while the inner membrane is deeply folded
they are able to make some of their own protein
v plastids plastids are present only in plant cells
there are two types of plastids chromoplasts and leucoplasts
chromoplasts are the coloured plastids present in leaves flowers and fruits
plastids containing the pigment chlorophyll are known as chloroplasts
they are important for photosynthesis in plants
chloroplasts also contain various yellow or orange pigments in addition to chlorophyll
plastids are similar to mitochondria in external structure
plastids have their own dna and ribosomes
vi vacuoles storage vacuoles are storage sacs for solid or liquid contents
vacuoles are small-sized in animal cells while plant cells have very large vacuoles % to % cell volume
in plant cells vacuoles are full of cell sap and provide turgidity and rigidity to the cell
in amoeba the food’vacuole contain the food items that is consumed it and contractile vacuoles expels excess water and some wastes from the cell
plant tissues on the basis of the dividing capacity plant tissues are of two types 
meristematic tissues consist of actively-dividing cells
meristematic tissues are of three types  apical meristem present at the growing tips of stems and roots
important function to increase the length of stems and roots
important function for the longitudinal growth of plants
 lateral meristem present on the lateral sides of the stems and roots
important function to increase the thickness of stems and roots
permanent tissues formed from meristematic tissues the cells in the tissue loose the ability to divider permanent tissues are divided into two categories  simple permanent tissue consist of only one type of cells
types of simple permanent tissues  parenchyma composed of unspecialised living cells with relatively thin cell walls intercellular space present in soft parts of the plant
their main function is storage
 collenchyma composed of living and elongated cells with cell walls irregularly thickened at the comers
it provides mechanical support and elasticity to plant
it helps in bending of leaves and stems
 sclerenchyma composed of long narrow and thick-walled cells
this tissue is made up of dead cells and there are no intercellular spaces
sclerenchyma cells are dead present in seeds nuts the husk of a coconut fibres of jute etc
 complex permanent tissue made up of more than one type of cells conducting tissues
 types of complex permanent tissues  xylem conducts water and minerals from the roots to the different parts of the plant
composed of four different types of cells—tracheids vessels xylem parenchyma and xylem fibres
 phloem conducts food material from the leaves to the different parts of the plant
composed of four different types of cells—sieve tubes companion cells phloem parenchyma and phloem fibres
protective tissue it is made of a single layer of cells
the epidermis of the leaf bears stomata
various types of epithelial tissues are  simple squamous epithelium single layer of flat cells
location in the human body lining of the mouth oesophagus lung alveoli etc
 cuboidal epithelium consists of cube like cells
location in the human body lining of the kidney tubules and ducts of the salivary glands
it’s function is secretion and absorption
 columnar epithelium consists of elongated or column-like cells
location in the human body inner lining of the intestine and gut
its function is of secretion and absorption
various types of connective tissues are  areolar tissue found in the skin and muscles around the blood vessels nerves etc
 dense regular connective tissue main components are tendons and ligaments tendons connect muscles to bones while ligaments connect two bones together
 skeletal tissue main components of skeletal tissues are cartilage and bone
 fluid tissue blood is the vascular tissue present in animals
muscular tissues main function of muscular tissues is to provide movement to the body
muscular tissues are of three types  striated muscles or skeletal muscles or voluntary muscles cells are cylindrical unbranched and multinucleate
 smooth muscles or involuntary muscles cells are long spindle-shaped and possess a single nucleus
nervous tissues present in the brain spinal cord and nerves
 neuron cells of the nervous tissue
 a neuron consists of a cell body an axon and a dendrite
the largest phylum of animal kingdom alone contains over a million species
there are varieties of plants right from small grasses to tall eucalyptus trees
this variety in living beings is called diversity
biodiversity the variety of animals and plants living in a given geographical area is called biodiversity of that geographical area
need for a system of classification because of the huge diversity in living beings it becomes very difficult task to study each of them one by one
to make their study easier animals and plants were categorized in groups and sub¬groups
thus the system of classification started
classification by aristotle aristotle classified animals according to their living environment
so he categorized them as either aquatic or terrestrial
drawbacks of aristotle’s classification both in sea as well as on land we can find animals and plants
moreover there are very small animals like sea-horse along with large animals like whale
so this was not a good basis of classification
in them the single cell is responsible for carrying out all necessary functions to maintain life
because of more number of cells there can be some division of labour to gain more efficiency
all green plants are autotrophs
they have a pigment chlorophyll in green parts which facilitates photosynthesis
all animals fungi and certain bacteria and protozoa belong to this group
for example in human beings there are separate systems for performing specific tasks
even in larger plants there is separate root system for conduction of water and minerals leaf for photosynthesis and flowers for reproduction
evolutionary relationship or phylogenetic relationship charles darwin wrote a book “origin of species’ in  and gave his theories of evolution
primitive body designs came early in evolutionary history leading to more complex designs
this gave rise to such a huge diversity in life forms
 locomotion by jair-like cilia or whip-like flagella for moving around in some members
 nutrition autotrophic or heterotrophic
 lichens some fungi live in a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria
the algal part provides food and the fungal part provides minerals and substratum
 plantae  multicellular eukaryotes with cell walls
 • animalia  multicellular eukaryotes without cell walls
classification of kingdom plantae thallophyta or algae plants that do not have well-differentiated body design fall in this group
the plants in this group are commonly called algae
these plants are predominantly aquatic
examples are spirogyra ulothrix cladophora and chora
bryophyta these are called the amphibians of the plant kingdom
the plant body is commonly differentiated to form stem and leaf-like structures
however there is no specialized tissue for the conduction of water and other substances from one part of the plant body to another
examples are moss funaria and marchantia
pteridophyta the plant body is differentiated into roots stem and leaves and has specialized tissue for the conduction of water and other substances from one part of the plant body to another
gymnosperms the plants of this group bear naked seeds and are usually perennial evergreen and woody
examples are pines and deodar
angiosperms this word is made from two greek words angio means covered and sperma—means seed
these are also called flowering plants
plant embryos in seeds have structures called cotyledons
cotyledons cotyledons are called ‘seed leaves’ because in many instances they emerge and become green when the seed germinates
the angiosperms are divided into two groups on the basis of the number of cotyledons present in the seed
 monocotyledonous seeds have a single cotyledon
 dicotyledonous seeds have two cotyledons
classification of kingdom animalia kingdom animalia is further classified into several following phylum
each phylum has it own classes sub-classes orders families etc
porifera  these are non-motile animals attached to some solid support which comprises of spicules of calcium carbonate silica
 there are holes or “pores’ all over the body
these lead to a canal system that helps in circulating water throughout the body to bring in food and oxygen
 animals are covered with a hard outside layer or skeleton which comprises of spicules of calcium carbonate silica
 there is a cavity in the body hence the name coelenterate coelom means cavity
 body is made of two layers of cells
 examples hydra jellyfish 
platyhelminthes  the body is bilaterally symmetrical meaning that the left and the right halves of the body have the same design
 there are three layers of cells from which differentiated tissues can be made which is why such animals are called triploblastic
 the body is flattened dorsiventrally meaning from top to bottom which is why these animals are called flatworms
 they are either free-living or parasitic
 examples planaria liver fluke 
nematoda  body is bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic
 body is cylindrical rather than flattened
 false body cavity or a pseudocoelom is present
 these are very familiar as parasitic worms causing diseases such as the worms causing elephantiasis filarial worms or the worms in the intestines roundworm or pinworms
 examples ascaris wucheraria 
annelida  these are bilaterally symmetrical and triploblastic
 true body cavity present
 body is divided into many ring like segments hence the name annelida

 skeleton made of calcium carbonate
 examples starfish and sea urchins 
protochordata  these animals are bilaterally symmetrical triploblastic and have a coelom
 in addition they show a new feature of body design namely a notochord at least at some stages during their lives
 the notochord is a long rod-like support structure chord*string that runs along the back of the animal separating the nervous tissue from the gut
it provides a place for muscles to attach for ease of movement
 examples balanoglossus herdemarda and amphioxus
vertebrata these animals have a true vertebral column and internal skeleton allowing a completely different distribution of muscle attachment points to be used for movement
all chordates possess the following features  notochord  dorsal nerve cord  triploblastic  paired gill pouches  coelomate vertebrates are grouped into five classes 
pisces  body is streamlined and has fins and tail for swimming
 skin is covered with scales
 skeleton can be made of bone or cartilage
 intake’ of oxygen is by gills
 the two-chambered heart is present
 examples fishes like rohu tuna shark 
amphibia  they are adapted to live both on land and water
 respiration is through either gills or lungs
 the three-chambered heart is present
 examples frogs toads salamander 
reptilia  these are crawling animals
 skin is rough and modified to withstand extreme temperatures
 the heart is three chambered in most while four-chambered in crocodiles
 examples lizards turtles snakes 
aves  body is covered with feathers and forelimbs are modified for flying
 the four-chambered heart is present
 examples sparrow eagle crow parrot 
mammalia  mammary glands are present which produce milk to nurture young ones
 warm-blooded animals with four-chambered heart
 most animals are viviparous giving birth to live young ones some are oviparous producing eggs
 examples man horse kangaroo lion conventions for writing the scientific names 
the name of the genus begins with a capital letter
the name of the species begins with a small letter
when printed the scientific name is given in italics
when written by hand the genus name and the species name have to be underlined separately
we describe the location of an object by specifying a reference point
the total path covered by an object is said to be the distance travelled by it
the shortest pathdistance measured from the initial to the final position of an object is known as the displacement
uniform motion when an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time it is said to be in uniform motion
non-uniform motion motions where objects cover unequal distances in equal intervals of time
speed the distance travelled by an object in unit time is referred to as speed
average speed for non-uniform motion the average speed of an object is obtained by dividing the total distance travelled by an object by the total time taken
velocity velocity is the speed of an object moving indefinite direction
graphical representation of motions i distance-time graph for a distance-time graph time is taken on x-axis and distance is taken on the y-axis
note all independent quantities are taken along the x-axis and dependent quantities are taken along the y-axis
motion is called uniform circular motion
unit of force is newton
a force can do three things on a body
 it can change the speed of the body
 it can change the direction of motion of a body
 it can change the shape of a body
balanced forces forces are said to be balanced forces if they nullify one another and their resultant force is zero
frictional force the force that always opposes the motion of objects is called a force of friction
the second law of motion the rate of change of momentum of an object is proportional to the applied unbalanced force in the direction of the force
 newton a force of one newton produces an acceleration of  ms on an object of mass  kg
=  kg ms f = ma third law of motion to every action there is an equal and opposite reaction and they act on two different bodies
conservation of momentum if the external force on a system is zero the momentum of the system remains constant i
 in an isolated system the total momentum remains conserved
suppose a and b are two balls they have mass ma and and initial velocities ua and ub as shown in above figure before collision
the two bodies collide and force is exerted by each body
there is change in their velocities due to collision
unbalanced forces when two opposite forces acting on a body move a body in the direction of the greater force or forces which brings motion in a body are called as unbalanced forces
first law of motion an object remains in a state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line unless acted upon by an external unbalanced force
the mass of an object is a measure of its inertia
a body with greater mass has greater inertia
maua + maub is the total momentum of the two balls a and b before collision and mava + mbvb is their total momentum after the collision
the sum of momenta of the two objects before collision is equal to the sum of momentum after the collision provided there is no external unbalanced force acting on them
this is known as the law of conservation of momentum
the force is along the line joining the centres of two objects
let two objects a and b of masses m and m lie at a distance of d from each other as shown in the figure
let f be the force of attraction between the law of gravitation g is called a universal constant because its value does not depend on the nature of intervening medium or temperature or any other physical variable
unit of g = nmkg value of g = 
 the motion of moon around the earth
 the motion of planets around the sun
 the tides due to the moon and the sun
freefall when an object falls down towards the earth under the gravitational force alone we say the object is in free fall
the velocity of a freely falling body changes and is said to be accelerated
this acceleration is called acceleration due to gravity denoted by ’g’
all objects small big heavy light hollow or solid fall at the same rate
the three equation of motion viz
if an object is just let fall from a height then in that as u =  and a = g = 
 ms- and the object will go to a maximum height h where its final velocity becomes zero i
mass mass of an object is the measure of its inertia
it is the matter present in it
it remains the same everywhere in the universe
weight the force of attraction of the earth on the object is known as the weight of the object
two conditions need to be satisfied for work to be done i a force should act on object a the object must be displaced work = force x displacement unit of workdone = joule = newton x metre  joule work is said to be done when  newton force is applied on an object and it shows the displacement by  meter
energy the capacity of a body to do work is called the energy of the body
unit of energy = joules kj =  j forms of energy the various forms of energy are potential energy kinetic energy heat energy chemical energy electrical energy and light energy
kinetic energy energy possessed by a body due to its motion
kinetic energy of an object increases with its speed
the energy possessed by such an object is called the gravitational potential energy
gpe = work is done in raising a body from the ground to a point against gravity
derivation consider a body with mass m raised through a height h from the ground force required to raise the object = weight of object mg
the object gains energy to the work done on it
mechanical energy the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy is called mechanical energy
law of conservation of energy energy can neither be created nor destroyed it can only be transformed from one form to another
the total energy before and after transformation remains the same
potential energy + kinetic energy = constant mechanical energy a body of mass ‘m’ is raised to height ‘h’ at a its potential energy is maximum and kinetic energy is  as it is stationary
when body falls at b h is decreasing hence potential energy decreases and v is increasing hence kinetic energy is increasing
when the body is about to reach the ground level h =  v will be maximum hence kinetic energy –> potential energy decrease in potential energy = increase in kinetic energy this shows the continual transformation of gravitational potential energy into kinetic energy
propagation of sound sound is produced by vibrating objects
medium the matter or substance through which sound is transmitted is called a medium
it can be solid liquid or gas
air is the most common medium for sound propagation
wave a wave is a disturbance that moves through a medium when the particles of the medium set neighbouring particles into motion
they in turn produce similar motion in others
the particles of the medium do not move forward themselves but the disturbance is carried forward
this is what happens during propagation of sound in a medium hence sound can be visualised as a wave
sound waves are characterised by the motion of particles in the medium and are called mechanical waves
when a vibrating object moves forward it pushes and compresses the air in front of it creating a region of high pressure
this region is called a compression c as shown in following figure
this compression starts to move away from the vibrating object
when the vibrating object moves backwards it creates a region of low pressure called rarefaction r
these make the sound wave that propagates through the medium
compression is the region of high pressure and rarefaction is the region of low pressure
experiment to show sound needs a medium activity  take and electric bell and airtight jar
 fit the bell inside the jar and attach to battery
 with air still in jar ring the bell
 now take out air by vaccumization
 ring the bell again
when air is taken out then sound cannot be heard
conclusion this shows that presence of medium is necessary for propagation of sound waves
properties of sound waves frequency number of oscillations of sound waves is called its frequency
the number of peak and troughs per unit of time will give frequency
it is represented by v nu and its si unit is hertz hz
time period the time taken to complete one oscillation is called its time period
its unit is second and is represented by t
relation of frequency and time period v = t amplitude the magnitude of the maximum disturbance in the medium on either side of the mean value is called the amplitude of the wave
it is usually represented by the letter a
softness or loudness of sound if the amplitude is smaller then the sound will be softer and if it is larger then sound will be louder
higher amplitude helps the sound wave is travelling faster
speed of sound it is the distance which compression or a rarefaction travels per unit of time
speed of sound in different media at ° c
reflection of sound sound reflects off a surface in the same way as light reflects and follows same rules of reflection
the incident sound and the reflected sound make equal angles with the normal and all three are in the same plane
echo in bigger monuments and in large empty halls you can hear reflections of your sound after you speak something
this effect is known as echo
the sensation of sound persists in our brain for 
 seconds so to hear echo the time difference between original sound and reflected sound should be more than that
as you know speed of sound in air is =  ms and  x 
 means it should be 
reverberation repeated reflections of sound results in persistence of sound and is called reverberation
use of reverberation of sound following instruments use this property of sound 
curved dome of concert halls range of hearing in humans from  hz to  hz sounds below  hz are called infrasonic
sounds above  hz are called ultrasonic
basic conditions for good health  proper balanced and nutritious diet
 clean environment and surroundings
 healthy air no pollution in the surrounding
 good standard of living and economic status
disease when the body is not at ease i
 comfortable then it is said to have a disease
when there is a disease the functioning or appearance of one or more systems of the body changes
depending on the duration—disease is classified as acute or chronic
acute disease diseases that last for only short period of time e
 headache common cold etc
chronic disease diseases that last for long time’ are called chronic diseases e
causes of diseases immediate cause and contributory cause
for example virus bacteria protozoa etc
for example dirty water unclear surroundings contaminated food improper nourishment poverty poor standard of living etc
diseases may be due to infectious and non-infectious causes
a infectious causes diseases where microbes are the immediate causes are called infections diseases
the infection spreads from one person to another
b non-infectious causes some diseases that do not spread in the community but remains internal are called non-infectious diseases
example cancer genetic abnormalities high blood pressure etc
infectious diseases spread through  air causes air-borne diseases due to bacteria virus e
 common cold influenza measles tuberculosis
 food and water is caused due to contaminated food and water that contains bacteria virus worm etc
example cholera typhoid and hepatitis
 contact many diseases spread by contact of infected person with the healthy person
examples fungal infection scabies etc
aids and syphilis spread due to sexual contact
 body fluids body fluids like blood semen mother milk when infected can also cause disease
they are used for diseases caused by bacteria
inflammation when an active immune system release many cells to the affected tissue to heat-off the disease-causing microbes it is called inflammation
local effects caused on body due to inflammation are— swelling pain fever and redness
principles of treatment  to reduce the effects of the diseases
 to kill the cause of the disease i
 to kill the microbes like bacteria fungi protozoa
principles of prevention  general method  specific method general ways of preventing infections relate to preventing exposure
prevention of exposure can be done tin following ways  for air borne infections—valid -visiting public place cover your nose and mouth while coughing
 for water borne infections- drink clean and boiled thinking water
 for vector borne infections keep the surroundings clean do not keep any puddle of water open in the surrounding as it allows the breeding of mosquitoes
 self immune system that can fight off and kill microbes when it enters our body
 availability of proper and sufficient -food for everyone
specific ways % giving vaccines a childhood immunisation that its given to the children for preventing infectious diseases
lithosphere the outer crust of the earth is called the lithosphere
hydrosphere sum of all water bodies is called hydrosphere
atmosphere air that covers the earth is called the atmosphere
biosphere the life-supporting zone of the earth where the atmosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere interact and make life possible is called biosphere
it consists of biotic components-living things and abiotic components-non- living things like air water and soil air it is a mixture of many gases like oxygen nitrogen carbon-dioxide water vapour and other gases
 nitrogen is used by plants for protein synthesis
 oxygen sustains life used for respiration combustion
 carbon-dioxide used by plants for preparing food by photosynthesis
atmosphere acts as a protective blanket around the earth
maintains the temperature on the surface of earth
winds are caused due to uneven heating of atmosphere these winds maintains the pressure difference and causes cold and hot air sea and land breeze brings rain etc
water various sources of water are available i
 surface water underground water snow ice-bergs water vapour in the atmosphere
use of water  water is used for transportation
 sustain life  used by plants and animals for life-processes
water available for drinking should be conserved and used wisely
soil soil is formed by a very slow process i
 by weathering of rocks
it consists of various nutrients
plants grow in the soil many microbe’s homes is soil
varieties of soil types are available  sandy soil  loamy soil  clayey soil  black soil  red soil  alluvial soil  laterite soil
temperature temperature and light is also required for all biotic components
pollution contamination of natural sources with unwanted substances
 air pollution air contaminated with smoke fumes dust pollen grain etc
 water pollution water contaminated by sewage industrial waste excreta chemicals fertilizers etc
bio-geo-chemical cycles a constant interaction between biotic and abiotic components of the biosphere makes a system and these flow of components form a cycle called bio-geo-chemical cycle
water cycle water from various sources evaporates condenses and again precipitates as rain falls on the land flows back in the sea and river is known as water cycle
nitrogen cycle nitrogen from the atmosphere is fixed by the process of nitrification
nitrification is done by nitrogen fixing bacteria e
the fixation is also done by atmosphere or industries
in atmosphere during lightning high temperatures and pressures created in air converts nitrogen into oxides of nitrogen which dissolves in water forming nitric and nitrous acids and is then used by life forms
plants contain nitrogen in the form of proteins or other complex compounds
plants are eaten by animals
when die bacteria present in soil act on and convert plants and animals various compounds of nitrogen into nitrites and nitrifies
another group of bacteria convert these nitrates and nitrites into free elemental nitrogen this process is called denitrification
carbon cycle carbon is present in the compound form in atmosphere ie
 co carbonates in water which forms limestone
plants and animals which get buried under the earth and does not decompose form coal and petroleum respectively
animals and plants also release co back to the atmosphere during respiration
different crops require different climatic conditions temperature and photoperiods for their growth and completion of their life cycle
photoperiods are related to the duration of sunlight
growth of plants and flowers are dependent on sunlight
successful crop production depends upon many factors such as  understanding how crops grow and develop
 effect of various nutrients climate water on the growth of the plant
 modification and management of each factor for increasing the yield of the crop
the crops which are grown in rainy season the kharif season from june to october are called as kharif crops
example paddy soyabean pigeon pea maize cotton green gram and black gram are kharif crops
the crops which are grown in winter season the rabi season from november to april are called rabi crops
example wheat grain peas mustard and linseed are rabi crops
crop variety improvement it can be done either by hybridisation or by introducing a gene
 crop improvement by hybridisation hybridisation refers to crossing between genetically dissimilar plants
 crop improvement by introducing a gene this provides the desired characteristics and results in genetically modified crops
 cultivation practices and crop yield are related to weather soil quality and availability of water
since weather conditions such as drought and flood situations are unpredictable varieties that can be grown in diverse climatic conditions are useful
the factors for which variety of improvement is done are  higher yield to increase the productivity of the crop per acre
 improved quality the quality of crop products vary from crop to crop
 the protein quality is important in pulses oil quality in oilseeds preserving quality in fruits and vegetables
 biotic and abiotic resistance biotic factors are the diseases insects and nematodes while abiotic factors are the drought salinity waterlogging heat cold and frost which affect the crop productivity
varieties resistant to these factors stresses can be improved to increase crop production
 change in maturity duration shorter maturity period of crop reduces the cost of crop production and makes the variety economical
uniform maturity makes the harvesting process easy and reduces losses during harvesting
 wider adaptability it allows the crops to be grown under different climatic conditions in different areas
 desirable agronomic characteristics it increases productivity for example tallness and profuse branching are desirable characters for fodder crops while dwarfness is desired in cereals so that less nutrients are consumed by these crops
plant nutrients nutrients are supplied to plants by air water and soil
there are sixteen nutrients which are essential for plants
air supplies carbon and oxygen hydrogen comes from water and soil supplies the other thirteen nutrients to plants
amongst these thirteen nutrients six are required in large quantities and are therefore called macro-nutrients
the other seven nutrients are used by plants in small quantities and are therefore called micro-nutrients
manure is prepared by the decomposition of animal excreta and plant waste
on the basis of the kind of biological waste used to make manure it can be classified into three types i compost ii vermicompost iii green manure
i compost it can be farm waste material such as livestock excreta cow dung etc
 vegetable waste animal refuse domestic waste sewage waste straw eradicated weedsetc
this material is decomposed in pits and this process of decomposition is also called composting
ii vermicompost the compost which is made by the decomposition of plant and animal refuse with the help of redworm is called vermicompost
iii green manure prior to the sowing of the crop seeds some plants like sun hemp or guar are grown and then mulched by ploughing them into the soil
these green plants thus turn into green manure which helps in enriching the soil in nitrogen and phosphorus
fertilizers fertilizers are commercially produced plant nutrients
fertilizers supply nitrogen phosphorus and potassium
they are used to ensure good vegetative growth leaves branches and flowers giving rise to healthy plants
fertilizers are an important factor in the higher yields of high-cost farming
these cropping systems are beneficial in insect pest and weed control besides providing nutrients
irrigation proper irrigation is very important for the success of crops
ensuring that the crop gets water at the right stages during their growing season can increase the expected*yield of a crop
different kinds of irrigation systems include wells canals rivers and tanks
 wells these are of two types namely dug wells and tube wells
in a dug well water is collected from water bearing strata
tube wells can tap water from the deeper strata
from these wells water is lifted by pumps for irrigation
 river lift system in areas where canal flow is insufficient or irregular axle to inadequate reservoir release the lift system is more rational
water is directly drawn from the rivers for supplementing irrigation in areas close to rivers
 tanks these are small storage reservoirs which intercept and store the run-off of smaller catchment areas
cropping patterns it includes different ways of growing crops so as to get the maximum benefit
these different ways include the following mixed cropping mixed cropping is growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same piece of land for example wheat + gram or wheat + mustard or groundnut + sunflower
this reduces disease risk and gives some insurance against failure of one of the crops
inter-cropping it involves growing two or more crops simultaneously on the same field in definite proportion or pattern
a few rows of one crop alternate with a few rows of a second crop for example soyabean + maize or finger millet bajra + cowpea lobia
the crops are selected such that their nutrient requirements are different
this way both crops can give better returns
crop rotation the growing of different crops on a piece of land in a pre¬planned succession is known as crop rotation
depending upon the duration crop rotation is done for different crop combinations
the availability of moisture and irrigation facilities decide the choice of the crop to be cultivated after one harvest
if crop rotation is done properly then two or three crops can be grown in ayear with good harvest
the food requirements of dairy animals are of two types a maintenance requirement which is the food required to support the animals to live a healthy life and b milk producing requirement which is the type of food required during the lactation period
weeds weeds are unwanted plants in the cultivated field for example xanthium gokhroo parthenium gazar ghas and cyprinus rotundus motha
they compete for food space and light
weeds take up nutrients and reduce the growth of the crop
therefore removal of weeds from cultivated fields during the early stages of crop growth is essential for a good harvest
methods of weed control the most effective method is mechanical removal
preventive methods such as proper seed bed preparation finely sowing of crops inter-cropping and crop-rotation also help in weed control
insect pests generally insect pests attack the plants in three ways  they cut the root stem and leaf  they suck the cell sap from various parts of the plant and  they bore into stem and fruits
they thus affect the health of the crop and reduce yields
preventive measures against pest include  the use of disease resistant varieties
 summer ploughing in this method fields are ploughed deep in summers to destroy both pests as well as weeds
animal husbandry is the scientific management of animal livestock
it includes various aspects such as feeding breeding and disease control
animal-based farming includes cattle goat sheep poultry and fish farming
milk-producing females are called milch animals dairy animals while the one used for farm labour are called draught animals
animal feed includes  roughage which is large fibre and  concentration which are low in fibre and contain relatively high levels of protein and other nutrients
the improved poultry breeds are developed for the following desirable traits  number and quality of chicks
 dwarf broiler parent for commercial chick production
 reduction in the size of the egg-laying bird with the ability to utilise more fibrous cheaper diets formulated using agricultural by- products
production of poultry birds for good production of poultry birds good management practices are important
these include maintenance of temperature and hygenic conditions in housing and poultry feed as well as prevention and control of diseases and pests
the housing nutritional and environmental requirements of broilers are somewhere different from those of egg layers
the ration daily food requirement for broilers is protein rich with adequate fat
the level of vitamins a and k is kept high in the poultry feeds
one is from natural resources which is called capture fishing
the other way is by fish farming which is called culture fishery
popular marine fish varieties include pomphret mackerel tuna sardines and bombay duck
marine fish of high economic value includes mullets bhetki pearl spots prawns mussels and oysters
as marine fish stocks get further depleted the demand for more fish can only be met by culture fisheries a practice called mariculture
fish resources are of two types  freshwater resources such as canals ponds reservoirs and rivers
 brackish water resources where sea water and fresh water mix together such as estuaries and lagoons
more extensive fish farming can be done in composite fish culture systems
both local and imported fish species are used in such systems
in such a system a combination of five or six species is used in a single fish pond
these species are selected so that they do not compete for food among them having different types of food habits
as a result the food available in all parts of the pond is used
food is needed by all living beings for four main purposes  for their growth
 to provide energy for doing work
 for the repair and replacement of the damaged tissues
 to provide resistance and protection against diseases from infections
if a person does not get food shehe feels weak and is likely to fall ill
different people have different choices of food
there is a wide range of food items eaten across various states of india
our food comes from different sources
we get food from plants as well as animals
we eat animals as meat as well as their different products like milk eggs and honey
cooked food can be easily consumed and absorbed by our body
cooking also kills the harmful germs
we should have sprouted seeds every day
sprouted seeds are rich in nutrients
ingredients materials needed to prepare a dish or food are called its ingredients
edible parts those parts of a plant which are eatable are called edible parts nectar sweet juices found in flowers are known as nectar
sprouted seeds seeds which grow white thread like structures when soaked in water are called sprouted seeds
herbivore animals which eat plants and plant products like fruits flowers seeds nectar etc
carnivore animals which eat other animals are called carnivores
omnivore animals which eat both plants and their products as well as other animals are called omnivores
let us see what mrs iyer and mrs kapoor have prepared
have they prepared the same kind of food list out the six food items that you see on their table
thus plant parts and animal products are our sources of food
rice food from plants green plants are known as producers because they prepare their own food
they use light air carbon dioxide water and chlorophyll present in their leaves to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis
different plant parts serve as sources of food for us
fruits vegetables cereals and pulses that we eat are obtained from different parts of a plant
roots of plants like carrot radish turnip sweet potato and beetroot are eaten fig
for example the stem of sugarcane plant is eaten and is also used to make sugar
the stem and flower of the banana plant is cooked and eaten in different parts of india
certain plants have underground stems that we eat
examples are potato onion garlic and ginger fig
leaves of plants like lettuce spinach cabbage coriander mint and basil are eaten fig
seeds pulses like mung bean kidney bean chickpea and cereals wheat maize and rice that we eat are seeds of plants fig
cumin seeds pepper and cardamom that we eat as spices are also seeds of different plants
sprouted seeds or sprouts of mung bean and chickpea bengal gram are very nutritious
sprouting involves soaking seeds and draining the water and then leaving them till they germinate
sprouts can be eaten raw as salads or cooked
fruits and vegetables plants also provide us fruits and vegetables fig
like different plant parts animal too serve as sources of food
let us learn about the main food products obtained from animals
food from animal animal products like meat egg honey milk cheese butter and curd are eaten by human beings
meat of animals like goat chicken fish and prawns is commonly eaten fig
it is a rich source of proteins and vitamins
some people also eat eggs of goose and duck
honey honey is a sweet liquid made by bees from the nectar of flowers fig
honey is collected from beehives
it is used in cooking and also has medicinal value
milk milk is obtained from animals like cow buffalo and goat
fig’- honev it is a very nutritious food item and is a rich source of proteins
milk also contains calcium which is required for proper bone growth and nerve function fig
some common dairy products are discussed below
paneer cottage cheese common methods of making paneer include adding lemon juice or vinegar to milk
then the liquid portion of milk is drained off and the solid part forms paneer
this process is called curdling
cheese cheese is made from curdled milk of cow goat sheep or buffalo fig
cream cream is made by collecting the top fatty layer of the milk
butter butter is made by churning fresh cream
curd common methods of making curd include adding a small sample of curd in warm milk
unlike green plants animals cannot make their own food
they depend on plants and other animals for food
people living in deserts also drink camel’s milk
in ice-cold places people mostly have yak’s milk
roots that we eat 
stems that we eat 
leaves that we eat 
flowers that we eat 
seeds that we eat what do animals eat different animals have different feeding habits
based on their feeding habits animals can be divided into three groups herbivores carnivores and omnivores
 or herbivores herbi plant vore eater are those that eat only plants and plant products
cow deer horse giraffe squirrel and butterfly are examples of herbivores
such teeth are suitable for pulling plants off the ground and grinding them
 herbivores like cow and camel have the ability to bring back previously swallowed food to the mouth for chewing it the second time
this helps them to absorb most of the nutrients from hard-to- digest food like grass
 squirrels have a pair of broad sharp-edged front teeth incisors in each jaw they use these teeth to gnaw food items like nuts
 herbivores like butterfly and hummingbird do not need to worry about chewing their food
they have mouth-parts shaped like a straw to suck nectar from flowers
 or carnivores carni meat vore eater are those that only eat the flesh of other animals
lion tiger jackal vulture owl eagle snake and spider are examples of carnivores
they also have sharp claws and powerful jaws which help them to tear flesh
 carnivorous birds like eagle have curved pointed beaks that allow them to tear flesh
 carnivores like chameleon and frog have a long sticky tongue that they use to catch insects
 carnivorous fish like shark has several small sharp teeth that help them bite off chunks of flesh
 or omnivores omni all vore eater are those that eat both plants and flesh of other animals
bear racoon crow and human beings are examples of omnivores
 omnivorous birds like crow have a sharp and pointed beak to help them eat a variety of food
scavengers and decomposers instead of hunting live animals some birds and animals eat the flesh of other animals that are already dead
vulture is one such bird
these animals or birds are called scavengers
together with scavengers decomposers play a very important role in nature
carnivore an animal that eats only the flesh of other animals is called a carnivore
omnivore an animal that eats both plants and flesh of other animals is called an omnivore
scavenger an animal that eats only the flesh of animals that are already dead is called a scavenger
different plant parts like root stem leaf flower and fruit serve as sources of food
animal products like meat egg honey milk curd cheese butter and ghee are eaten by human beings
herbivores have wide blunt teeth that help them to grind and chew plants
carnivores have sharp teeth and claws that help them to tear flesh
nutrition the process of consuming nutrients required for the growth and development of our body and to obtain energy is known as nutrition
our food contains three main substances called nutrients
these are fats proteins and carbohydrates
in addition our body requires water salts minerals vitamins and fibres
diet it is the amount of food eaten by a person at a time
malnutrition if a person does not get adequate food or if hisher diet does not contain all the nutrients he or she becomes weak
when the body does not get adequate nutrition it is said to be suffering from malnutrition
various food components are grouped in three classes  energy giving food carbohydrates and fats
 protective food vitamins and minerals
 cellulose starch sucrose glucose and fructose are the important carbohydrates found in our food
 starch turns iodine solution to dark blue or black
groundnut oil soybean oil and mustard oil are examples of fats derived from plants
fats like butter and ghee are obtained from animals
 fats act as fuel in our body but they provide more energy than carbohydrates
in our body has some advantages of fat deposits in small quantity
 too much fat deposition is harmful for the body
this leads to the condition called obesity
 fatty substances leave greasy and transparent spot on paper
vegetable proteins can be obtained from legumes including pulses and beans
 proteins are required for growth and repairing of our body
they help in building new tissues
they also account for tough fibrous nature of hair and nails and for the structure of muscles
they are a part of our blood and help in proper functioning of our body
 large amount of protein is needed for building new tissues in short period such as during infancy pregnancy or when mother is nourishing a child
vitamins vitamins are required by our body in very small quantities
vitamins help in keeping our eyes bones teeth and gums healthy
minerals minerals are needed by our body in small amounts
each one is essential for proper growth of body and to maintain good health
some sources of minerals are shown in fig
 water helps our body to perform many functions like digestion throwing out dissolved waste as urine and impure blood
 water also keeps our body cool through sweating
 water helps in blood circulation
roughage  whole grains flour and cereals potatoes fresh food raw and cooked vegetables provide roughage to our food
 it helps in proper digestion of food and prevents constipation
food items that are deep fried and roasted usually lose their nutritive value
energy requirement requirement of energy or intake of food depends on profession age sex and special needs like pregnancy infancy lactation etc
deficiency diseases diseases that occur due to the lack of nutrients are called deficiency diseases
some of them are listed in the following table 
beriberi it is a disease caused due to the deficiency of vitamin br the muscles of beriberi victim get weak
carbohydrates carbohydrates are the energy giving nutrients
the main carbohydrates found in our food are in the form of starch and sugar
energy energy is the capacity to do work
we need energy for our various activities
fats fats act as fuels in our body
they are obtained either from animals or from plants
minerals minerals are needed by our body in small quantities
all of them are essential for proper growth of the body and to maintain good health
nutrients the components of food that are necessary for growth and development of our body are called nutrients
proteins proteins are required for growth and repairing of tissues in our body
they help in building new tissues
they are mainly provided by plant products in our food
scurvy scurvy is caused due to the deficiency of vitamin c
bleeding gums is its main symptom
starch starch is a kind of carbohydrate
vitamins vitamins are also an important nutrient
deficiency of any vitamin causes deficiency diseases
food is essential for all animals including human beings
the food that we eat contains different components
look at the picture of food items given below
write the names of components of food that you think are present in the food items
write your answers in the spaces provided
let us learn more about the various components of food and their importance
nutrients are substances that are needed by our body for proper growth and healthy body function
there are six main components present in food carbohydrates fats proteins vitamins minerals and roughage or dietary fibres
these nutrients fulfill different needs of the body
carbohydrates carbohydrates provide energy to your body which keeps it going throughout the day
there are two major types of carbohydrates in food sugar and starch
sugars sugar is also called simple carbohydrate
fruits honey and table sugar are some sources of sugar
starch starch is also called complex carbohydrate
plants store energy in the form of starch
rice wheat corn potato and bread are some sources of starch
when we eat plant products containing sugar and starch our digestive system breaks them down into glucose
this glucose which is the simplest form of sugar is then absorbed into the blood and provides us energy
if we do not eat proteins our body will not be able to repair damaged cells or build new ones
proteins in our diet come from both animal and plant sources fig
meat fish egg and milk are some animal sources of proteins
pulses soyabeans grams and nuts are some plant sources of proteins
vitamins vitamins are needed for the proper functioning of our body
they help in keeping our eyes bones teeth and gums healthy
there are  vitamins each of which has a specific function
vitamins are of two types fat- soluble and water-soluble
fat-soluble vitamins vitamins a d e and k are fat-soluble vitamins
our body prepares vitamin d in the presence of sunlight
water-soluble vitamins vitamins bl b b b b and folic acid together known as vitamin b complex and vitamin c are water-soluble vitamins
since water-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body these need to be regularly supplied through food items like citrus fruits spinach and other green leafy vegetables etc
lack of vitamins in the body can cause deficiency diseases
minerals just like vitamins minerals also help our body to stay healthy
minerals perform important functions like formation of bones teeth and blood cells and helps in maintaining a normal heartbeat
minerals are of two types macrominerals and trace minerals fig
macrominerals {macro large are needed by the body in larger amounts as compared to trace minerals
calcium magnesium sodium and potassium are examples of macrominerals
trace minerals are needed by the body in very small amounts
iron zinc copper and iodine are examples of trace minerals
roughage or dietary fibres the portion of the plant food that do not provide any nutrients to our body but help in maintaining a healthy digestive system is called roughage or dietary fibres fig
soluble roughage are soluble in water whereas insoluble roughage are not
apple strawberry peach and rice are examples of food items rich in soluble roughage that help in blood circulation
whole grain carrot cabbage turnip and cauliflower are examples of food items rich in insoluble roughage
lack of insoluble roughage in the diet causes the stool to become hard and difficult to pass
this condition is called constipation
water almost % of our body weight is water
water is needed by our body for good health
 it helps to transport substances inside our body
 it helps our body to absorb nutrients from food
 it helps to regulate our body temperature
 it is needed for various chemical reactions that take place inside our body during digestion excretion etc
milk fruits vegetables and juices are good sources of water
balanced diet our diet must contain adequate amount of different nutrients for our body to function properly
a diet that contains adequate amount of different nutrients required for the healthy functioning of our body is called a balanced diet
a balanced diet must include food items from the following four food groups
 milk group includes milk and milk products  meat group includes meat chicken fish lamb etc
 and meat substitutes beans peas nuts and seeds  fruit and vegetable group includes fruits and vegetables  grain group includes breads and cereals
deficiency diseases lack of carbohydrates proteins vitamins or minerals in the diet can cause diseases
diseases that are caused due to the lack of nutrients in the diet are called deficiency diseases
deficiency diseases cannot be transmitted from one person to another
deficiency of carbohydrates carbohydrates are the main energy sources
lack of carbohydrates in the diet results in lack of energy and stamina
a labourer who does hard manual work needs more carbohydrates in his diet than a person who does his work sitting in his office
deficiency of proteins growing children need more proteins in their diet
lack of proteins in the diet weakens muscles
deficiency of proteins leads to a disease called kwashiorkor fig
deficiency of proteins along with carbohydrate deficiency is called protein energy malnutrition pem
these diseases are more common in children of rural areas
if the treatment is started in time improving protein intake may correct this disease
marasmus is more common among infants and children under  years of age
a child suffering from marasmus becomes very thin shows slow body growth lack of energy loss of appetite weak legs mental retardation poor muscle development etc
to prevent these diseases the government of india has started programmes like the integrated child development scheme icds and the mid-day meal scheme in schools
deficiency of vitamins table 
 lists some important vitamins and their sources functions deficiency diseases and symptoms
therefore vitamin c-rich food items should be eaten raw
scurvy was common among sailors in ancient times
due to lack of cure several sailors died of this disease during long voyages
in the th century james lind found that eating citrus fruits reduced the occurrence of scurvy in sailors
deficiency of minerals table 
 lists some important minerals and their sources functions deficiency diseases and symptoms
minerals also assist in certain chemical reactions in the body
cooking does not destroy them
excess loss of water from the body leads to a condition called dehydration
dehydration causes loss of salts and leads to weakness in the body
oral rehydrating solution ors can be given to the patient to recover from dehydration
it is available free of cost at primary health centres
it can also be made at home by mixing  teaspoons of sugar and  teaspoon of salt in  litre of clean drinking water
unsaturated fats fats that are normally liquid at room temperature are called unsaturated fats
fat-soluble vitamins vitamins that are stored in the fat tissue and used only when the body needs them are called fat-soluble vitamins
water-soluble vitamins vitamins that are not stored in the body and need to be regularly supplied through food are called water- soluble vitamins
macrominerals minerals that are needed by the body in larger amounts are called macrominerals
trace minerals minerals that are needed by the body in very small amounts are called trace minerals
dietary fibre the portion of plant food that does not provide any nutrients to our body but help in maintaining a healthy digestive system is called dietary fibre
balanced diet a diet that contains adequate amount of different components of food required for healthy functioning of the body is called a balanced diet
deficiency diseases diseases that are caused due to the lack of nutrients in the diet are called deficiency diseases
carbohydrates proteins fats vitamins minerals and dietary fibres are the main components of food
carbohydrates and fats provide energy to the body
proteins are needed for muscle-building and for repairing worn-out tissues
a balanced diet should include food items from four basic food groups
deficiency of carbohydrates causes lack of energy and stamina
deficiency of proteins causes kwashiorkor whereas combined deficiency of proteins and carbohydrates causes marasmus
deficiency of vitamins can cause night blindness beriberi anaemia scurvy and rickets
deficiency of water can cause dehydration
deficiency of minerals can cause osteoporosis rickets anaemia and goitre
fibres are obtained from natural as well as man-made sources
natural sources cotton jute silk wool etc
 are obtained from natural sources- plants or animals
man-made sources polyester nylon rayon etc
 are man-made materials used for making clothes
plant fibres all the plants have fibres in their body structure e
 cotton and mango have fibres on their seed coconut on its fruit jute in its stem and banana tree in its leaf
animal fibres important animal fibres are wool hair of sheep and silk from silkworm
cotton is the most important industrial crop
india was the proud inventor of cotton clothing
cotton has been used in india since  b
production cotton is grown in maharashtra gujarat punjab rajasthan tamil nadu and madhya pradesh
climate required cotton plants need warm climate
cotton is planted early in the spring
cotton bolls fruits of cotton plant are spherical-shaped structures of the size of wall nut which are called cotton bolls
on maturation cotton bolls burst open exposing the white fibres
‘ when fibres dry in the sun light they become fluffy
cotton fibres cotton fibres are obtained from cotton bolls
ginning the process in which seeds from cotton are pulled out by steel combs is called ginning
charkha charkha is a machine on which yarn was spun directly from ginned cotton in olden days
bales ginned cotton is compressed tightly into bundles weighing approximately  kg called bales
sliver raw cotton from bales is cleaned combed and straightened and finally converted into rope like strands called sliver
a sliver of cotton is a loose strand or rope of cotton fibres
twisting of fibres into yarn increases the cohesion and strength of fibres
handlooms and powerlooms in villages the clothes from cotton are woven on small scale known as handlooms
on large scale cotton clothes are made by machines known as powerlooms
uses of cotton cotton is used  in manufacturing of textiles
 as an absorbent in hospital
 as fillers in mattresses pillows and quilts
 as a main raw material for the manufacturing of rayon and paper industry
clothes from cotton are extensively used as mops in household and for cleaning machines in industries
jute is the most extensively used fibre next to cotton
in india jute is mainly grown in west bengal bihar and assam
extraction of fibres  jute plants are cut at the time of flowering stage
 the cut plants are grouped at different places in the fields for few days when most of the leaves dry up and fall down
 plants are tied into small bundles
 retting the bundles are made to sink in stagnant water of pond for few days when the gummy skin rots out to separate fibres
the process is called ‘retting’
 fibre is extracted from retted jute by hand with jerks and pulls
uses of jute  jute is extensively used for making gunny bags potato sacks carpets curtains coarse clothes ropes etc
 these days fine quality of jute is also used for making jute fabrics
primitive men and women had no idea about clothes
primitive life was confined mostly to the tropics where the climate was warm and no clothing was needed
during stone age people wore bark big leaves or animal skins
people started wearing stitched clothes after the invention of needle about  to  years ago
cloth making was developed in three stages  first stage was making cloth from plant fibres  second stage began with the use of animal fibres and  third stage began with the development of man-made or synthetic fibres
type of clothings which we wear is influenced by climate occupation culture and daily needs
clothing is necessary for the following reasons  it protects us from wind and weather
 it protects us from injury
 it maintains the body heat
woollen and cotton clothes feel rough and that of rayon nylon or polyester are smooth to touch
roughness of cotton and woollen fibres is due to the presence of many folds and uneven surface in it
silk rayon nylon and polyester are smooth because they have long plain fine structures
cloth is made from threads and threads in turn are spun from fibres
coconut fibres for instance are very hard and can only be used for making ropes or as a coir in mattresses
soft and long fibres like cotton wool nylon etc
 are suitable to make yam
it is advised to wear cotton clothes while working in the kitchen and near fire
cotton wool the lumps of cotton fibres are called cotton wool
it can be used as absorbent filling quilts pillows etc
fabric yam can be woven or knitted manually or by machines into fabric
knitting the process of making fabric from a single yam
spinning the process of making yam from fibres
weaving the process of arranging two sets of yam together to make a cloth is called weaving
cotton wool cotton wool is obtained from cotton plant
it is made up of thin cotton fibres
fabric woven material cloth is called fabric
fibre thread like animal or plant tissue is called a fibre
knitting knitting is a process of making a piece of fabric from a single yam
spinning the process of making yam from fibres is called spinning
yarn spun fibres are called yarns
clothes are made of different materials
we get these materials from both plants and animals
identify the materials given below as plants or animal product
write p for the plant products and a for animal products
let us learn about how the story of clothing started the different materials used to make clothes and how they are made
answers cotton socks jute rope silk cloth lather shoes
history of clothing about  years ago people started using animal skins for clothing
it is believed that wool was used as early as  years ago
domestication of silkworms to produce silk occurred around  bc in china
in india cotton came into widespread use around  bc
these fabrics were not stitched
they were just wrapped around the body
fiber and fabric clothes are made mostly from fibres
fibres are thin strands of thread that are woven to make fabric for example cotton fabric silk fabric etc
the fabric is stitched to make clothes
for example cotton fabric can be stitched into a cotton frock or a cotton kurta
there are two main processes of making fabric from fibre – weaving and knitting
weaving weaving involves making fabric by arranging two sets of yarn
it is done using a machine called loom which can be hand-operated fig
the pattern in which two sets of threads are arranged in a piece of woven cloth is called a weave fig
knitting knitting involves making fabric by forming a series of connected loops of yarn by using knitting needles or machines
natural and synthetic fibres different types of fibres fibres used to make fabric may be natural or synthetic
fibres that are obtained from plants or animals are called natural fibres
examples are cotton jute wool and silk
fibres that are made by man from chemical substances are called synthetic fibres
examples are nylon rayon polyester and acrylic
let us learn more about plant fibres
 jute coir silk cotton hemp and flax are examples of plant fibres
denim used to make jeans is made from cotton
cotton the cotton plant is a shrub
it grows well in black soil and warm climate
cotton is a soft fibre that grows around the seeds of the cotton plant
a variety of textile products are made from cotton
jute jute is a fibre obtained from the bark of the jute plant fig
it can be grown in different soil types ranging from clayey to sandy soil
it grows well in regions where it rains a lot
almost % of the world’s high-quality jute comes from bangladesh
bangladesh india china nepal and thailand are the main producers of jute
other useful plant fibres there are other important plant fibres as well
coir coir is the fibre obtained from the outer covering or the husk of the coconut
usually coconuts are left in water for a few months
the husk is then separated from the nut and beaten with wooden mallets to get the fibre
the fibre thus obtained is spun and dyed and is ready for weaving
coir is used to make several household products like rope and floor covering and also as a stuffing in mattresses and pillows
this fibre is obtained from the silk cotton tree also called kapok
the fruits of the kapok tree contain fibres that are light and fluffy like cotton
when the fruit ripens it bursts open releasing the fibres
hemp hemp fibres are obtained from the stem of the hemp plant
hemp fibres are used in the production of ropes carpets nets clothes and paper
flax fibres obtained from the stem of the flax plant are woven to make a fabric called linen
flax fibres are also used in the production of rope and high-quality paper
fabric the material made by weaving the threads from fibres is called fabric
weaving weaving involves the making of fabric from yarn
spinning the process of making yarn from fibres is called spinning
retting the process of rotting the stems of the plants in water to remove the sticky substance and separate fibres is called retting
clothing materials are obtained from both plants and animals
fibres are woven to make fabrics and fabrics are stitched to make clothes
fibres may be natural or synthetic
cotton jute coir silk cotton hemp and flax are some plant fibres
all objects around us are made up of one or more materials
a thing can be made of different materials
many things can be made from the same material
classification the process of sorting and grouping things according to some basis is’called classification
basis of grouping we can group materials on the basis of the similarities and differences in their properties
each material has its own properties that may differ from others
however some properties may be common to one or more materials
uses of a material uses of a material depend on its properties and the purpose for which it has to be used
metals have lustre while non-metals generally have no lustre
smooth and rough surface some materials feel smooth when touched e
 mirror and things made of metals whereas some other materials feel rough when touched for example a piece of stone
hardness and softness materials which can be pressed easily are called soft while some other materials which cannot be pressed are called hard for example cotton is soft while wood is hard
 insoluble substances substances which do not dissolve in water are called insoluble substances
 miscible those liquids which mix well with water are said to be miscible
 immiscible substances which do not mix well with water are called immiscible
 solubility of gases solubility of gases in water is very less
 oxygen gas which is dissolved in water is very important for the survival of aquatic plants and animals
buoyancy some materials float in water while others sink  materials like sand sugar and salt sink in water
 materials like wax oil and wood float on water
for example wood iron gold
 translucent materials through which things are only partially visible are called translucent
for example butter paper old glass door
 transparent materials through which things can be seen are called transparent
for example glass water air test tube
things are grouped together for convenience and to study their properties
hard materials which cannot be pressed easily are called hard e
insoluble materials which do not dissolve in water are called insoluble
lustre some materials have a special shine on them which is called lustre
material the matter of which an object is made is called material
for example glass steel wood etc
metals materials which have certain properties like lustre malleability ductility and are sonorous good conductors of heat and electricity are called metals
rough some materials have uneven surface and feel rough on touching
soluble materials which dissolve in water are called soluble
translucent materials which partially allow light to pass through them are called translucent
transparent materials which allow light to pass through them are called transparent
grouping on the basic of common properties objects are made of different materials
one material can be used to make different objects
this is possible because different types of materials have different properties
we have to choose materials with the right properties based on what we want to use it for
for example a chalk made of wood or plastic would be of no use because it cannot be used to write on the blackboard
materials have different properties like roughness lustre transparency solubility flotation attraction towards a magnet conduction of heat and conduction of electricity
let us study these properties one by one
roughness materials can be rough or smooth
rough materials have bumps or ridges on their surface which can be felt by touching them
smooth materials lack these bumps
examples of rough materials are rocks sandpaper and bark of a tree
a glass sheet flower petals and surface of an apple are some examples of smooth surfaces fig
all metals in pure state are shiny and said to possess lustre
this property of metals is widely used for making jewellery and other decorative articles
materials like gold silver and bronze have lustre fig
transparency different materials allow different amounts of light to pass through them depending on a property called transparency
based on transparency materials can be of three types transparent translucent and opaque
materials that allow all the light to pass through them are called transparent materials fig
glass water acrylic sheet and cellophane paper are transparent
shopkeepers generally prefer to keep items like toffee biscuit sweet etc
in transparent jars so that we can see them easily
materials that allow some light to pass through them are called translucent materials
oiled paper and coloured glass are translucent materials
materials that do not allow light to pass through them are called opaque materials
wood metal leaf stone and cardboard are opaque materials
state all substances are made up of matter
matter exists in three states – solid liquid and gas
based on their solubility materials can be soluble insoluble miscible or immiscible
solid materials that dissolve in water are said to be soluble in water
for example common salt and sugar
solid materials that do not dissolve in water are said to be insoluble in water
for example sand wood stone chalk powder and wax
liquids that dissolve in water are said to be miscible in water
for example alcohol vinegar lemon juice honey and glycerine
liquids that do not dissolve in water are said to be immiscible in water
for example kerosene coconut oil and diesel
some gases dissolve in water e
 carbon dioxide and oxygen
soft drinks have carbon dioxide dissolved in them
gases like nitrogen hydrogen and helium are insoluble in water
flotation certain materials float on water whereas others sink
this property of a material to float on water is called flotation
generally materials like wood leaf and feather float on water whereas rock and metal sink
this property is called magnetism
objects made of iron are attracted to a magnet
in addition to iron nickel and cobalt are also attracted to a magnet
conduction of heat if you observe the utensils in your kitchen you will notice that though most of them are made of metals their handles are made of wood or hard plastic
why aren’t the handles made of metal as well this is because metals get heated whereas materials like plastic and wood do not fig
it would be difficult to hold the handles made of metal while cooking
generally metals are conductors of heat whereas non-metals like wood plastic glass bamboo air and paper are insulators of heat
conduction of electricity we get electricity in our homes through cables and wires
an electric cable consists of a number of metal wires with or without a plastic covering fig
the metal wires conduct or transmit electricity whereas the plastic covering do not
materials that conduct electricity are called conductors
materials that do not conduct electricity are called insulators
for example metals are conductors of electricity wood air and plastic are insulators
transparent materials that allow light to pass through them are called transparent materials
translucent materials that allow some light to pass through them are called translucent materials
opaque materials that do not allow light to pass through them are called opaque materials
miscible liquids that are soluble in water are said to be miscible in water
magnetic materials materials that are attracted by a magnet are called magnetic materials
conductors materials that conduct heat or electricity are called conductors
insulators materials that do not conduct heat or electricity are called insulators
materials have different properties that make them useful for making different objects
an object can be made from different materials
different objects can be made from the same material
materials can be rough or smooth transparent or opaque soluble in water or insoluble can float on water or sink can be a conductor or insulators of heat or electricity
elements and compounds are pure substances
some of the pure substances are iron copper water salt etc
impure substances substances containing more than one type of constituent particles are called impure substances
some of the impure substances are pond water milk etc
impurities these are the unwanted particles present in a substance making it impure
mixtures substances which contain more than one component mixed in any ratio are called mixtures
for example air is a mixture of many gases like nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide dust particles etc
homogeneous mixtures the mixtures in which the particles of the substances present cannot be seen are called homogeneous mixtures
for example solution of sugar and water air cold drinks etc
heterogeneous mixtures the mixtures in which particles of the substances present can be seen easily are called heterogeneous mixtures
for example water in oil dust in air
need for separation we carry out the separation of the components of a mixture or an impure substance with the following purposes  to remove the unuseful or harmful component
 to obtain the useful component
 to remove impurities for getting a pure sample
 we use the difference in any one of these properties in the components of a mixture to separate them
methods of separation handpicking winnowing sieving magnetic separation sedimentation decantation loading filtration evaporation sublimation distillation churning etc
 are some common methods of separation
churning or centrifugation it is the process of separation of the lighter particles of a suspended solid from a liquid
for example to obtain butter from the curd or milk
condensation the process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid form is called condensation
crystallisation the process of crystallisation is used for obtaining pure crystalline substance from impure sample
decantation it is the transfer of clean liquid from one vessel to the other without disturbing the settled sedimented particles
evaporation it is the process of removing water or moisture from a mixture either by heating on flame or direct sunlight
for example salt from sea water is obtained by this method
filtration filtration is used to separate solid particles from liquid by passing the mixture through a filter paper
handpicking this method is used for separating small particles of dirt stone husk etc
 from the grains of wheat rice pulses etc
loading it is the process of faster sedimentation by suspending alum to a liquid
sieving  sieving is used when two components of a mixture have different particle sizes
 sieving allows the fine particles to pass through the holes of the sieve while the bigger particles remain on the sieve
for example sieving of wheat flour sieving of sand at construction sites
saturated solution a solution in which no more soluble substance can be dissolved at room temperature is called saturated solution
solution when a soluble substance is dissolved completely in a liquid say sugar in water a homogeneous mixture is formed
it is known as a solution
threshing the process that is used to separate grain from stalks is threshing
winnowing winnowing can be used to separate lighter and heavier components of a mixture
for example to separate husk from grain with the help of air
methods of separation different methods are used for separating different substances that are mixed together
let us learn about some common methods that are used
threshing grains or seeds of plants like rice and wheat serve as sources of food
the flour atta that is used for making chapattis is made from wheat grains
after these crops have been harvested or cut the grains need to be separated from the stalks the dried stems
this is done by threshing
it is done manually by hand or with the help of machines
manual threshing is done by holding a pile of crop and beating it on a rock or a hard surface fig
this loosens and separates the grain from the stalk
sometimes threshing is also done by crushing the harvested stalks using bullocks
threshing is also done with the help of machines like the combine harvester fig
threshed grains may still contain seed coverings and tiny pieces of leaves or stem collectively called chaff
these are separated by winnowing
winnowing the method used to separate chaff from the grain by wind or blowing air is called winnowing
the mixture of chaff and grain is taken in a winnowing basket fig
the farmer stands at a higher level and lets the mixture fall to the ground
the separated chaff is used as fodder for cattle
the direction of the wind plays an important role in the process of winnowing
hand-picking rice wheat pulses etc
 that we buy from the market may contain impurities unwanted or harmful particles in the form of small stones unwanted grains etc
often these impurities look very different from the food item and can be spotted easily
the method of separation used in such a case is hand-picking fig
sieving if the components of a mixture are of different sizes they can be separated by sieving fig
the smaller component passes through the pores of the sieve whereas the larger component stones or husk is left behind in it
this method is used in some homes to separate wheat bran the bigger particles from flour
however sieving wheat flour is not advisable as wheat bran which is removed during sieving is very rich in nutrients and is also a rich is better to remove visible impurities by hand picking
the process of sieving is also used to separate pebbles and stones from sand at construction sites
the stones and pebbles present in the mixture remain in the sieve and the fine sand particles pass through the holes of the sieve
however dirt insects tiny pieces of straw and other lighter impurities float at the top
the water which contains these impurities is then poured out and discarded
this process involves two methods sedimentation and decantation
the process of separating insoluble solids suspended in a liquid by allowing them to settle down is called sedimentation
the solid particles that settle down during sedimentation are called sediments
the process of pouring out the clear upper liquid without disturbing the sediments is called decantation
the liquid above the sediments is called a supernatant
a mixture of sand and water can also be separated by sedimentation and decantation
the mixture is left undisturbed for some time
sand being heavier settles down and water is poured out into a separate container
filtration is commonly used in our homes
for example after preparing tea we filter out the tea leaves using a strainer
filtration is also done to remove pulp from fresh fruit juice
water may also contain solid impurities which can be removed by filtration
during filtration the insoluble solid is retained in the filtering device whereas the liquid passes through it
it is important that the particles of the insoluble solid are bigger than the holes in the filtering device for them to be retained in it
a filter paper is a filtering device that has very fine pores in it
condensation the process in which gas changes into liquid is called condensation
condensation is the opposite of evaporation
in nature water vapour in the air condenses to form its liquid form the dew
condensation takes place only when water vapour hits a cold surface
this is because the salt has dissolved in the water
dissolving is a change where substances mix completely with the liquid they have been added to
not all substances dissolve in water
only some substancessalt dissolves in water
like salt and sugar dissolve in water and are known as soluble substances
substances like chalk and sand do not dissolve in water and are known as insoluble substances
the substance that dissolves is called the solute and the substance in which the solute dissolves is called the solvent
the resulting mixture is called the solution
thus solute + solvent = solution
 sugar + water = sugar solution
this shows that no more sugar can be dissolved
we say that the solution has become saturated fig
a saturated solution is the solution in which no more of the solute can be dissolved
but what if we heat the solution can we then dissolve that ‘extra’ sugar present in the saturated solution yes we can increase the solubility of a solute by heating the solution
solubility is the ability of a substance to get dissolved in a given liquid
the quantity of a substance that can dissolve in hot water is much more as compared to that in cold water
there are some other factors that increase the solubility of a solute
then we keep one glass undisturbed and stir the other
sugar dissolves faster when the solution is stirred
solute in powdered form we can observe this by taking two glasses of water and adding a whole sugar cube in one glass and powdered or crushed sugar cube in the other
sugar in the powdered form dissolves first
different substances dissolve in different amounts of water while making a saturated solution
threshing the process of beating harvested crops to separate seeds from the stalks is called threshing
winnowing the method used to separate chaff from the grain by wind or blowing air is called winnowing
sedimentation the process of separating insoluble solids suspended in a liquid by allowing them to settle down is called sedimentation
decantation the process of pouring out the clear upper liquid without disturbing the sediments is called decantation
filtration the process by which an insoluble solid is separated from a liquid by passing the mixture through a filtering device is called filtration
saturated solution a solution that can dissolve no more of the solute is called a saturated solution
threshing is done either manually or by using machines to separate seeds or grains from the stalks
winnowing involves separating the chaff from the grain by letting the mixture fall to the ground from a height when the wind is blowing
hand-picking involves manually removing small stones insects etc
insoluble solid impurities present in water can be removed by filtration
common salt can be separated from seawater by evaporation
solubility of a solute can be increased by heating the mixture or it can also be increased by adding the solute in the powdered form
 mixing it with something else
changes caused by heating when an object is heated it gets affected in one or many possible ways
 some objects get hot but do not change in any other way
 some objects get hot and also expand in size
 some objects get hot and begin to bum
 some objects get hot and change their state
changes by applying pressure when we apply force to an object  we can change its shape and size
 air can be compressed
 metals can be hammered into thin sheets
 elastic can be stretched
 cotton can be spun into thin threads
changes by mixing a substance with other we can bring about a change in a substance by mixing it with another
for example making solution by mixing water soluble substances in water
metals expand on heating and contract on cooling
chemical changes these are the changes in which chemical properties of a substance change and a new substance is formed
for example cooking of food
characteristics of physical changes  no new substances are formed
 products are identical to the reactants
 these changes are reversible
characteristics of chemical changes  properties of products are different from the properties of reactants
 most of the chemical changes are irreversible
 these changes always result in energy changes
reversible changes these are the changes that can be reversed
for example stretching of rubber
irreversible changes these are the changes which cannot be brought back to its original state
for example burning of paper
melting point a constant temperature at which a solid starts melting
this temperature is called the melting point of that solid
freezing a process in which liquid changes into solid form is called freezing
force a push or a pull acting on a body which tends to change its state of rest or motion is called a force
natural changes the changes which occur in nature on their own are called natural changes
for example change of day and night change of season
slow changes the changes which take longer time to occur are called slow changes
for example rusting of iron tooth decay
 flowers bloom and then wither away
we can also bring a change e
 change in the size of a balloon by blowing air in it
contraction a process in which an object becomes smaller or shrinks is called contraction
evaporation a process in which liquid changes into vapour is called evaporation
expansion a process in which an object becomes bigger in size e
 metals expand on heating
melting a process in which a solid melts to become a liquid on heating is called melting
reversible and irreversible changes changes that occur around us can be broadly categorized as reversible or irreversible depending on whether or not they can be reversed
reversible changes changes that can he reversed are called reversible changes
what happens to an ice cream if you do not finish it quickly it melts
can you change the molten ice cream back into a solid yes just keep it in the freezer
molten ice cream can be changed back to its solid form
thus melting is a reversible change
melting of butter and chocolate are also reversible changes fig
when this water molten ice is heated for some time it starts boiling liquid starts to evaporate and steam escapes from the container fig
now if you hold a lid over the container the steam will again liquify or condense into small droplets of water on coming in contact with the cold lid fig
this water can be cooled down further and then kept in the freezer to form ice again fig
thus the three physical states of water are reversible and can be changed from one state to another by heating or cooling
irreversible changes changes that cannot be reversed are called irreversible changes
there are a large number of irreversible changes that take place around us
these result in a new material being produced which may or may not be useful
some examples of irreversible changes are given below
 ripening of fruits is an irreversible change because it is not possible to get back the raw fruits from ripened or mature ones
 milk gets spoiled when not refrigerated particularly in summer
this is called curdling or souring of milk which is an irreversible change
curdling of milk is also done by adding lemon juice to milk for making cottage cheese or paneer
burning of paper is an irreversible change
a new substance called ash is left or formed after a paper has been burnt
this new substance differs from the paper in its appearance and properties
cooking of food is an irreversible change because we cannot get back the ingredients in their original form after cooking them
for example after a cake is baked using flour egg milk chocolate etc
burning of a candle is often cited as an example of physical change because what we see immediately is melting of wax that solidifies on cooling
however when a candle burns the wax is undergoing two changes at the same time first it melts and then it burns
what burns is actually melted wax
the melted wax burns on the wick – the wick itself isn’t burning it is just the wax on it
physical and chemical changes changes in which no new substances are formed are called physical changes
for example breaking of a glass fig
 freezing of water tearing of paper etc
changes in which new substances with different properties are formed are called chemical changes
cooking of food burning of substances are chemical changes as entirely new substances are formed
expansion and contraction of materials some materials expand on heating and some contract on cooling
heating makes the particles that form the material expand or become loose
cooling makes the particles that form the material contract or become tight
the amount of expansion differs in solids liquids fig- - physical change and gases
gases expand the most while solids expand the least
 shows some examples of expansion
cooling does the opposite of heating
cooling causes a material to contract
solids contract the least while gases contract the most
 lists some examples of contraction
applications of expansion and contraction expansion by heating can be used in several everyday activities
the jammed metal lid of a jam jar can be opened by heating
the jar is inverted and just the lid is dipped in hot water
after some time the lid can be opened easily as the lid gets slightly expanded
the fact that materials expand on heating is used in thermometers
in many thermometers mercury is used
why the electric lines are never hung tautly between the poles wires in the outside environment are subjected to extreme weather conditions ranging from acute hot to cold temperatures
a taut wire on contraction in winters can snap
reversible change a change that can be reversed is called a reversible change
irreversible change a change that cannot be reversed is called an irreversible change
physical change a change where no new substances are formed is called a physical change
chemical change a change where new substances with different properties are formed is called a chemical change
changes happen around us and also within us
some changes are reversible while some others are irreversible
some changes are physical changes some are chemical changes
heating causes expansion in a material
cooling causes contraction in a material
gases expand the most and solids expand the least
gases contract the most and solids contract the least

 parts of a flower are usually present in rings or whorls
 pedicel the stalk that joins a flower to the plant is called the pedicel
 sepals it is the outermost whorl of the flower
often they are small green leaf like structures
they protect the inner parts of a flower while it is still a bud
different flowers have petals of different colours
some flowers have sweet smelling petals
with its colour and fragrance the petals attract not only the human beings but also the insects and the birds
 stamens these are - in number and are male reproductive part of a flower
each stamen is made up of two parts—filament and anther
 pistil it is the innermost part of a flower

taproot the root system in which a single root arises from the base of the stem with secondary and tertiary branches is called a taproot system
transpiration the loss of water in the form of vapours from the stomata on leaves is called transpiration
trees tall plants with hard thick and woody stem are called trees
veins thread like structures in leaf are called veins
root systems  there are two main types of root systems tap root and fibrous root system
tap root system in the tap root system fig
 a single root called the primary root comes out from the seed after germination
tap roots are also called true roots
mango neem pine sheesham pea carrot radish turnip and beetroot are examples of plants in which tap roots are found
fibrous root system fibrous roots fig
 which grow from the base of the stem have a bushy appearance
these roots are thin and almost equal in size
grass maize wheat onion sugarcane and rice are examples of plants with fibrous roots
functions of roots some functions of roots are given below anchoring the plant roots help to anchor the plant firmly into the ground
desert plants have relatively longer roots because they penetrate deep into the soil in search of water
preventing soil erosion they help to bind the soil particles together thereby preventing them from being carried away by water or wind
sometimes roots are modified to perform various other functions like reproduction nutrition etc
root modifications roots of some plants are modified to perform additional functions
let us study some of these modifications and their functions fig
shoot system all parts of a plant that are above the ground form the shoot system
it includes stem leaf flower fruit etc
stem the stem is a very important part of the plant
this ensures that they get enough light for photosynthesis
 it bears flowers buds leaves and fruits
 it conducts water and mineral salts from the roots to the leaves
similarly it carries the food manufactured by the leaves to other parts of the plant
 green stem has chlorophyll and can carry out photosynthesis
 it has nodes from which leaves arise
the space between two nodes is called an internode fig
stem modifications stems of certain plants are modified to perform special functions
some of the modifications and their functions are given below
for storage of water stems of plants like cactus and jade swell up to store water in them
to manufacture food stems of some plants become leaf-like and flattened like that of a cactus and perform photosynthesis
 to protect the plant from being eaten by animals
for support stems of some climbers like grapes and passion flower are modified to form special structures called tendrils fig
these help the climber plants like which have weak stems attach themselves to others for support
for storage of food potato onion and ginger are modified stems that store food
there are three kinds of underground stems tubers e
 ginger and bulbs e
 onion and garlic fig
for multiplication of the plant rhizomes bulbs and tubers also help in the multiplication of plant
leaves leaves are known as food factories of the plant
they arise from at the nodes of the stems and have a characteristic shape and size
let us study its different parts fig
the arrangement of veins in a leaf is termed as venation
venation is of two types parallel and reticulate
if the veins run parallel to one another from the base to the tip of the leaf the leaf is said to have parallel venation e
 banana and onion fig
if the veins are arranged in a net-like pattern on both sides of the midrib the leaf is said to have reticulate venation e
 peepal and mango fig
it is usually green due to the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll
a leaf prepares food for the plants
the process of making food by the plant using carbon dioxide water chlorophyll and light is called photosynthesis
plants store food in the leaves fruits and stems in the form of starch
plants breathe with the help of their leaves
leaves of most plants have tiny openings called stomata singular stoma fig
the exchange of gases takes place through the stomata fig
leaves also lose water through the stomata
the loss of water through the stomata is called transpiration
transpiration helps the plant in the following ways it helps in cooling the leaves just as loss of water during sweating helps in keeping our bodies cool
during transpiration more water is ‘pulled’ upwards from the roots to compensate for the lost water
this water brings along important nutrients from the roots which are required by the leaf
leaf modifications leaves of some plants are modified to form special structures called tendrils
tendrils help plants to attach themselves to a support
plants having tendrils are generally climbers
for protection leaves of certain plants get modified to form spines
spines also reduce the amount of water lost from the plant
 shows the parts of a flower
pollination  for a flower to develop into a fruit and form seeds pollen grains must be transferred from its anthers to the stigma
many flowers are brightly coloured and have a sweet smell to attract insects like bees fig
when the insect sits on the flower the pollen grains stick to its body and may get rubbed off when it sits on another flower
after pollination the ovules change into seeds
 form the ovary develops into a fruit
 shows the structure of a bean seed
node part of the stem from where the leaves arise is called a node
internode the distance between two nodes is called the internode
venation the arrangement of veins in a leaf is called venation

stamen male part of a flower is called the stamen
carpel female part of a flower is called carpel
pollination transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma is called pollination
seed coat the outer covering of a seed is called the seed coat
the parts that remain under the ground roots form the root system
there are two main types of root systems tap root system and fibrous root system
roots may be modified for support storage of food propagation etc
stems may be modified for support protection photosynthesis food storage and reproduction
leaves are green because they have a green pigment called chlorophyll
green leaves manufactureb their food with the help of carbon dioxide water and light
flowers have petals sepals stamens and carpel
the pollen grains need to be transferred to the stigma from the anther of the flower for pollination
the seed has an embryo which develops into a new plant under suitable conditions
this framework is called the skeleton
 our skeleton is made up of a number of bones and cartilages
 there are about  muscles attached to the various bones in our body
 the bones are hard and rigid
 cartilages are comparatively soft and elastic
functions of skeleton  skeleton system gives support to the body
 together with muscles it gives the body its shape
 red blood cells and some white blood cells are produced in the marrow of the bone
x-ray machine we can get photographs of bones by a machine called x- ray machine
doctors use these photographs to examine the injuries and diseases of bones
the bones in our body vary in their sizes and shapes
different types of c bones have different functions
the skull the skull has two main parts  cranium the bones of cranium are flat
they are held firmly like a zipper
it covers and protects the brain
 facial bones the facial bones comprise the upper jaw lower jaw and few other bones
the lower jaw is movable
the movement of lower jaw enables us to eat talk and sing
these form a safe pocket for eyes
the backbone backbone or vertebral column is composed of  small ring like vertebrae joined end to end
it forms a hollow bony tube
the main nerve cord passes through it
the shoulder bones the shoulder bone is formed by the collor bone and the shoulder blade

gait of animals some animals do not have bones
they have muscles which help to extend and shorten the body
during movement animal first extends the front part of the body keeping the rear position fixed to the ground
after that animal fixes the front end and releases the rear end
now animal shortens the body and pulls the rear end forward
during this practice animal moves forward by a small distance
rib cage ribs join with the chest bone and the backbone together to form a box
this is called rib cage
 animals move from one place to another
this kind of movement is called locomotion

flying adaptations streamlined body bones with air spaces forelimbs modified into wings air sacs connected to lungs and massive flight muscles are some adaptations in birds for flying
 fish the fish swims by forming loops alternately on the two sides of the body
the tail pushes them forward
the vertebrae and the muscles attached to them work for it
a large number of vertebrae and associated muscles push the body forward
the ventral scales also help in the process
 insects the body and legs of insects have hard joined coverings forming an exoskeleton
the muscles of the breast connected with three pairs of legs and two pairs of wings help the cockroach to walk and fly
 snails the snails are moved by the muscular foot
the hard unjoined shell have no relation with the foot
 earthworm the earthworm moves by alternate extension and contraction of the body affected by the muscles
the minute movable bristles help in gripping the ground
backbone backbone or vertebral column is composed of  small ring like bones called vertebrae
it is a hollow bony tube
ball and socket joint a joint in which rounded end of one bone fits into the cavity of the other bones
bristles hair like structures projecting out of the body of earthworms
with the help of these it fixes itself with the ground
cartilage it is the additional part of the skeleton that is not as hard as the bones and which can be bent also

non-standard measures the lengths of steps arms hands or fingers of different people are different therefore the distance measured with their help is not always reliable
these methods are therefore called non- standard measures
standard measures measures that are the same all over the world are known as standard measures
in october  the th general conference on weight and measures adopted the international system of units
“the system international units” is the set of units to maintain uniformity all over the world
metre it is the standard unit of length
the symbol of metre is m
each metre m is divided into  equal divisions called centimetre cm
each centimetre has ten equal divisions called millimetre mm
we define a larger unit of length
it is called kilometre km
 km =  m
simple multiples of units units that are used for the measurement of larger distances are the multiples of si unit
for example deca hecto kilo
 decametre =  m  hectometre =  m  kilometre =  m sub-multiples of units units used for measuring smaller distances are the sub-multiples of si units
for example milli centi deci
 m =  decimetre  m =  centimetre  m =  millimetre
making measurement of a length in making measurement of length of an object we should follow the following procedure place the scale in contact with the object along its length as shown in fig
measurement with a scale with broken ends  avoid taking measurements from zero mark
 use any other full mark of the scale say 
  the reading at starting mark is 
 cm and at the other end it is 
therefore the length of the object is 
correct position of the eye is also important for making measurement
your eye must be exactly above the point where the measurement is to be taken as shown in fig
position ‘a’ is the correct position of the eye
note that from position a’ the reading is 
from positions ‘b’ and ‘c’ the readings may be different
least count a scale is marked in centimetres and millimetres
with the scales of this kind we can measure correctly up to one millimetre that is one-tenth of a centimetre
this is called the least count of a  cm scale
we can use a thread or divider to measure the length of a curved line
motion it is a state of objects in which they are moving that is they are changing their place with the changing time
rest all the stationary objects which are not in motion that is do not change their place with time are said to be at rest
rectilinear motion when the objects change their position with time along a straight line this type of motion is called rectilinear motion
circular motion  when a body moves in a circular path its motion is known as circular motion  examples  motion of stone tied in a thread and whirled
 motion of a blade of an electric fan
motion of second’s hand in a clock
in circular motion the object remains at the same distance from a fixed point
example motion of a top
periodic motion motion in which an object repeats its motion after a fixed interval of time is called periodic motion
examples  oscillations of a pendulum
 motion of a swing
combination of two or more types of motions in some situations the motion of an object may be a combination of two or more of the above mentioned types of motion
examples  motion of a ball on the ground
here the ball is rotating about an axis but the axis itself is moving along a straight line
thus the ball executes a rectilinear motion as well as rotational motion
unit of measurements  it involves the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity of the same kind
 this known fixed quantity is called unit
 the result of measurement is expressed in two parts
one part is a number the other part is the unit of measurement
circular motion when a body moves in a circular path its motion is known as circular motion
distance measurement of gap between two points in certain units is called distance
measurement measurement means the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity
motion it is a state of objects in which they are moving that is they are changing their place with time
rectilinear motion when the objects change their position with time along a straight line this type of motion is called rectilinear motion
si units in october  the th general conference on weight and measures adopted the international system of units to maintain uniformity all over the world
this system of units is called si units
units of measurement measurement means the comparison of an unknown quantity with some known quantity
this known fixed quantity is called a unit of measurement
for example sun torch etc
non-luminous objects these are the objects which do not emit light of their own
such a body becomes visible when light falls on it
for example the moon the planets etc
ray of light a straight thin beam of light from a source to an object is called a ray of light
obstacle an object which comes to the path of the light is called an obstacle
formation of a shadow  all the opaque objects seem to form a dark shadow of their own
 we need a source of light an opaque object in the way and a screen to see a shadow
 screen this is a surface on which the shadow is formed
it may be a butter paper or simply ground
 shadows give us some information about shapes of objects
 the colour of the opaque object does not affect the colour of the shadow
 all the space behind the opaque object up to some distance behind it seems to be filled with the shadow
here is a picture showing the path of rays of light coming from an object far away to a pinhole and then to screen
when sunlight passes through the leaves of a tree the gaps between the leaves act as the pinholes
these natural pinholes cast nice round images of the sun
rectilinear propagation light travels in a straight line
it is called rectilinear propagation of light
image formed by a mirror flat has following features  reflected image retains the colour of the object
 image is erect but laterally inverted
lateral inversion right side of the object appears as left side in the image formed by a plane mirror
for example if we show our right hand image in the mirror will show as left hand
in a mirror if you see another person surely the other person can also see you in that mirror
luminous objects that give out or emit light of their own are called luminous objects
mirror a smooth shining surface which rebounds the light back in same or in different directions is called a mirror
opaque objects if an object completely stops the passage of all the light falling on it it is an opaque object
pinhole camera it is a device which forms a photograph-like image of a bright object on a screen
shadow opaque objects do not allow light to pass through them and cast dark patches behind them
these dark patches are called shadows
translucent objects some objects allow only a part of light falling on them to pass through such objects are called translucent objects
for example a single thin sheet of paper
transparent objects those objects which allow all the light to pass through them are called transparent objects
sources of light any object that gives out light is called a source of light
luminous objects are also called sources of light
sources of light can be natural or artificial man-made fig
some artificial sources of light are candle electric bulb and laser
transparent translucent and opaque materials  different types of materials transmit light differently
based on the way they transmit light materials can be divided into transparent translucent and opaque materials
materials that allow light to pass through significant scattering or absorption fig
a are called transparent materials
we will be able to see through these materials very clearly
examples of transparent materials are clear air clear glass clean water some kinds of plastic and cellophane paper
materials that allow light to pass through them but scatter or diffuse the light as it passes through i
 a parallel beam of light comes through in all directions are called translucent materials fig
b that is why an object cannot be seen clearly through a translucent material
examples of translucent materials are butter paper a frosted glass paper smeared with oil and smoked glass
materials that completely block light are called opaque materials fig
we will not be able to see through these materials at all
examples of an opaque materials are metal mud cement coal and wood
a mirror is a very good example of opaque material
an ideal mirror does not let any light pass through it
when we want to represent the propagation of light with a diagram we represent it with the help of rays and beams
ray a ray is a line with an arrow that shows the direction of propagation of light and such a diagram is called a ray diagram
the property of light to travel in straight lines explains many interesting phenomena related to light like formation of shadows by opaque objects and formation of images in a pin-hole camera
shadows an opaque object blocks the light falling on it
this creates an area of darkness on the side of the object away from the source of light
a translucent object also creates a faint area of darkness
an area of darkness formed by an opaque object obstructing light is called a shadow
the following three things are required for a shadow to form fig
a shadow will not form if any of these is absent
this explains why we cannot see a shadow in the dark
it is only when light rays are obstructed by an opaque object that we get a shadow of the object
let us perform an activity to learn about the characteristics of a shadow
 the size of a shadow varies depending on the distance between the object and the source of light and the distance between the object and the screen
reflection surfaces we say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface
reflection of light helps us to see most of the things around us
reflection of light by a surface depends on the nature of the surface
a rough and bumpy surface also called an irregular surface reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in different directions fig
a good example of a rough surface is bark of a tree and blanket
this kind of reflection is called diffused reflection
a smooth surface a highly polished surface reflects a parallel beam of light incident upon it in one direction
a good example of a smooth surface is a mirror
when you stand in front of a mirror you can see yourself in the mirror
this is called your image
a very interesting phenomenon occurs when an object forms an image by reflection
this is something all of us must have noticed while seeing ourselves in the mirror
when we lift our right hand the image in the mirror appears to lift its left hand
this seeming left-right reversal is called lateral inversion
an image is different from a shadow
some of the differences between an image and a shadow are given in table 
 with a very tiny hole on one of its sides
light falls on the hole and an inverted image is formed on the side opposite to the hole
the human eye acts very much like a pin-hole camera
source of light an object that gives out light luminous object is called a source of light
transparent material a material that transmits all the light is called a transparent material
translucent material a material that transmits some amount of light is called a translucent material
shadow an area of darkness formed by an opaque object obstructing light is called a shadow
objects can be transparent translucent or opaque depending on how much light can pass through them
a shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks the light falling on it
a shadow is always black regardless of the colour of the object
we say light is reflected when it bounces off a surface
a rough and bumpy surface reflects light in different directions
a smooth surface reflects light in only one direction
an image shows the colour outline and details of the object
electric cell electric cell is a source of electricity
production of electricity in a cell an electric cell produces a small amount of electricity from chemicals stored inside it
when the chemicals in the electric cells are used up the electric cells stop producing electricity
terminal all types of electric cells have two terminals a positive terminal and a negative terminal
in a dry cell used in our homes the central carbon rod is the positive + terminal and the zinc contained is the negative - terminal
battery when two or more cells are joined together the combination is called a battery
bulb we get light from a thin tiny wire inside the glass cover
it is supported by two thicker wires as shown in fig
one of these thick wires is connected to the metal casing around the base of’the bulb
the other is connected to the metal tip of the base
the base of the bulb and the metal tip of the base are the two terminals of the bulb
the inside portion of the bulb is filled up with inert gases like argon
circuit the complete path from one terminal of the electric cell through the bulb and back to the other terminal of the electric cell is called a circuit
open circuit if there is any gap in the path of a circuit the bulb does not light up
such a circuit is called an open circuit
closed circuit the bulb lights up only when a bulb and wire form a complete path which starts at one terminal of electric cell and ends at the other terminal
such a circuit is called a closed circuit
flow of current in a circuit as soon as the path from one terminal of electric cell to the other is completed an electric current starts flowing through the circuit and the bulb lights up
the electric current flows from the positive terminal of the electric cell to its negative terminal
when the current flows through the filament it starts glowing
fused bulb if the filament of the bulb is broken the circuit is not corhpleted and hence the current cannot flow
the bulb with broken filament is called a fused bulb
when a bulb gets fused it does not light up
electric switch electric switch is a simple device that either breaks the circuit or completes it to stop or start the flow of current
 when the switch completes the circuit it is called closed switch
 when the switch breaks the circuit it is called open switch
conductors  materials through which electric current can flow are called conductors
 most metals are conductors
 our body is also a good conductor
in other words insulators are the bad conductors of electricity
 rubber and wood are insulators
conduction tester it is a simple device to test whether a material is a conductor or insulator
filament the thin wire that gives off light is called the filament of the bulb
dry cell dry cell is a source of electricity
it generates direct current dc due to chemical reaction that takes place inside it
bulb an electric bulb is a device which glows and emits light when electric current is passed through it
conductors materials that allow electric current to pass through them are called conductors
electric cell electric cell is a source of electricity
filament in electric bulb there is a thin tiny wire inside the glass cover
insulator materials that do not allow electric current to pass through them are called insulators
switch electric switch is a simple device that either breaks the circuit or completes it to stop or start the flow of current
terminal all types of electric cells have two terminals a positive terminal and a negative terminal
life without electricity is difficult to imagine
many devices and machines in our day-to-day life run on electricity
look at the pictures given below
which of these run on electricity write their names in the space provided
things that run on electricity have electric current passing through them
you will learn some very interesting things like how to make a small bulb glow and how to make an electric switch
with help from an adult look at what is inside a transparent electric bulb fig
among other things you will see that it has a thin filament a very thin metal wire
the filament heats up when an electric current is passed through it
it heats up so much that it begins to glow and give out light
now we will learn what produces an electric current
source of electric current a device that can be used to produce an electric current is called a source of electric current
common sources of electric current are cells and batteries collection of cells which comes in various shapes and sizes fig
 and electric current that we get from plug points in houses
a very useful kind of cell which we use very often is the dry cell
due to a chemical reaction that takes place in cells and batteries electric current is produced
for large-scale production of electricity flowing water or steam is used
the dry cell as its name suggests contains dry or semi-solid ingredients
let us take a look inside a dry cell fig
the dry cell contains a paste of ammonium chloride inside a zinc container
inside the paste a cardboard container containing powdered manganese dioxide and carbon is placed
a rod usually carbon with a metal cap is dipped into the manganese dioxide
the whole thing is then sealed with only the metal cap sticking out so that the contents do not spill out
the zinc can is also wrapped so that only the base is exposed
every source of electric current has two ends or terminals where conducting wires are connected to draw electric current
the tip of the metal cap and the base of the zinc can are called the positive and negative terminals of the dry cell respectively
electric current can be thought of as ‘flowing in’ from one terminal and ‘flowing out’ from the other
if the tip of the metal cap and the base of the zinc can are connected by a metal wire current will flow through it
different types of electric cells apart from the simple primary cells like dry cell there are different types of electric cells
different cells use different methods for producing an electric current
primary cells can be used only once and have to be thrown away once they have been used up
there are cells that can be recharged once they are drained
these are called secondary cells
they are used in mobile phones laptops and car batteries
nowadays solar cells are being used in many applications
solar cells use sunlight to produce electric current
 some devices that work on dry cell
solar panels made up of solar cells are used to light up streets and many homes
flow of electric current three basic conditions fig
 are required for an electric current to flow
 a device used to produce an electric current like cell battery or a plug point acting as a source
 a wire made of a metal like copper silver or aluminium which will allow electric current to flow through easily
 an unbroken loop of the wire running from one terminal of the source through various appliances back to the other terminal of the source
making a simple electric circuit when we connect the terminals of a pencil cell name given to the cell due to its shape to a bulb using two wires the bulb glows
a path for an electric current to flow is called an electric circuit
a one wire from the pencil cell is connected to the torch bulb while the other wire is not
the electric circuit is not complete here
b both the wires from the cell are connected to the torch bulb
the electric circuit is complete in this case
electric current flows only if there is an unbroken path or closed circuit starting from one terminal of the source through the torch bulb to the other terminal of the source
thus the bulb glows in figure 
b but not in figure 
the circuit in figure 
hence current cannot flow through the circuit and the bulb does not glow
such a circuit is called an open circuit
the circuit in figure 
electric current flows through the circuit and as a result the bulb glows
such a circuit is called a closed circuit
in an electric circuit the electric current flows from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of the electric cell
 shows the direction of flow of electric current in a circuit
electric switch we use electric switches fig
 to put on or off the electrical devices and machines
but do you know how it works an electric switch is a device that is used to open or close an electric circuit
when we open an electric circuit the flow of electric current in the circuit stops fig
a and when we close an electric circuit an electric current flows through it fig
in an electrical circuit a switch is sometimes
an electric torch has one or more dry cells inside it which act as the ‘source’
these cells are connected through a switch to a small bulb
when the switch is pushed to the ‘on’ position the circuit is complete and the bulb glows
when the switch is pushed to the ‘off’ position the circuit is incomplete broken
now the current cannot flow through the circuit and the light goes out
each shows a complete electric circuit
then why is it that the bulb glows only in circuits b and d it is because not all materials allow electric current to pass through them
a material that allows electric current to pass through it is called a conductor of electricity like the key and the safety pin figs
a material that does not allow electric current to pass through it is called an insulator of electricity like the rubber band and the plastic pen figs
all metals are conductors of electricity while some are better conductors than others
a few non-metals like graphite pencil lead is made of graphite are also conductors of electricity
flowever the smallest impurity in water impurities are substances like salts dissolved in water makes it a conductor
the handles of screwdrivers and testers used by electricians are usually made of wood or hard plastic
they also wear rubber gloves while repairing an electric switch to avoid electric shock
electrical safety electricity can be very dangerous if you do not handle electrical devices carefully
one should never play with electrical wires and sockets
electricity from cells is safe and you can experiment with it but you have to be careful not to connect the two terminals of a cell directly through a wireconductor
electricity generated by portable generators is dangerous and should not be used for experiments
source of electric current a device that can be used to produce an electric current is called a source of electric current
electric circuit a path for an electric current to flow is called an electric circuit
closed circuit a circuit which has an ‘unbroken path’ through which an electric current can flow is called a closed circuit
open circuit a circuit with a break in it is called an open circuit
in a dry cell a chemical reaction takes place to produce an electric current
a dry cell contains solid or semisolid ingredients
all cells have two terminals the positive and the negative terminal
electric current flows only if there is an unbroken or complete path starting from one terminal of the source through various devices back to the other terminal of the source
an electric switch is a device that is used to open or close a circuit
uses of a magnet a magnet finds its use at a number of places
for example refrigerator’s door some pencil boxes many toys magnetic stickers soap stand pin stand all make use of a magnet for their functioning
shapes of magnets magnets are made of different materials and in different shapes
effect of a magnet on materials a magnet attracts certain materials whereas some do not get attracted towards magnet
magnetic materials the materials which get attracted towards the magnet are known as magnetic materials e
 leather plastic cloth paper
magnetic poles magnetic attraction is maximum near the ends of the magnet
these ends are called magnetic poles
when suspended freely magnet always aligns in north-south n-s direction
lode stone it was a stone used by sailors in olden days to identify directions when they were in sea
compass this is a small glass case containing a magnetised needle pivoted on a nail
the needle can rotate freely
wherever it is kept its needle always rests in north-south direction
so using this needle north and south can be identified
attraction between two poles opposite poles of two magnets attract each other
repulsion between two poles similar poles of two magnets repel each other
magnetic effect can pass through screen magnetic influence can pass through screens of some substances like cloth plastic paper glass etc
to keep them safe bar magnets should be kept in pairs with their unlike poles on the same side
they must be separated by a piece of wood while two pieces of soft iron should be placed across their ends
for horse-shoe magnet orfe should keep a piece of iron across the poles
compass this is a small glass case containing a magnetised needle pivoted on a nail
the needle can rotate freely and always rests in north- south direction
magnet a magnet is a metallic object which attracts iron or magnetic things
magnetite it is an ore of iron which has magnetic properties
north pole when suspended freely one pole of the magnet always points towards north
this is known as north-pole
south pole when suspended freely the end of a magnet points towards south
this is known as south-pole
put a v’ mark against the object that you think would stick to a magnet and ‘x’ against the objects that would not stick to a magnet
let us now learn more about magnets
discovery of magnets according to a legend the first magnet was discovered by a greek shepherd named magnes
it is said that the nails in his shoes and the iron tip of his staff got stuck to a large black rock on which he was standing
greeks named this strange type of rock ‘magnetite’
the chinese also knew about magnets
ancient chinese sailors used magnets for navigation
magnets magnets are made of materials that attract objects made of certain substances like iron cobalt and nickel
magnets come in various shapes and sizes fig
they can be found as horseshoe ring cylindrical or bar shape
not all objects are attracted to magnets
objects that are attracted by a magnet are said to be magnetic e
objects that are not attracted by a magnet are said to be non-magnetic e
they stick more on certain parts of the magnet
these are called the poles of the magnet
magnetic forces are the strongest at the poles
for example the two ends of a bar magnet are its poles
there are two types of poles in every magnet irrespective of its shape
these are by convention called the north pole n and the south pole s fig
the two poles cannot exist independently
that is they always come in pairs
if we break a bar magnet in the middle we would get two pieces each having a north pole and a south pole
we could go on breaking the magnet into smaller pieces and everytime we would get both the poles in each piece
using a magnet to find directions today we use magnets for various purposes
in ancient times the primary use of a magnet was to find directions
if a magnet is allowed to move freely it comes to rest in a direction very close to the earth’s north-south direction
this property of a magnet was used to find directions on the surface of the earth by travellers
an instrument with a magnet that is used to find directions is called magnetic compass
it has a small magnetic needle at its centre
this needle can rotate freely and always points in the earth’s north-south direction
different directions north south east and west are marked on the compass
 shows how one can find directions using a magnetic compass
but where is this other magnet it is the earth itself
this alignment happens because of the influence of the earth which itself acts like a giant bar magnet fig
it influences all the magnets within its region of influence to align themselves along its north-south direction
attraction and repulsion when two magnets are brought close to each other they are either pulled towards each other or pushed away from each other
when the magnets are pulled towards each other they are said to attract each other
when they are pushed away from each other they are said to repel each other
whether the magnets attract or repel depends on which poles of the magnets are facing each other
when unlike poles of the magnets n-s or s-n are brought close to each other they attract
magnets that retain their magnetic properties only for a short period of time are called temporary magnets
magnets that retain their magnetic properties for a long period of time are called permanent magnets
temporary magnets are usually made of iron cobalt or nickel
these materials behave like magnets only when they are near a strong magnet
they quickly lose their magnetic property if the influence of the strong magnet is removed
permanent magnets are made from mixtures of iron cobalt or nickel with other materials
these make strong magnets and retain their magnetic properties for a long time
care of magnets a magnet can lose its properties due to the following activities
 dropping from a height  hitting with a hammer  applying heat  improper storage can also cause loss of magnetic properties
a horseshoe magnet should be stored with a piece of soft iron kept across its poles
uses of magnets magnets have several uses  credit cards atm cards and identity cards have a strip of magnetic material that stores information
 television and computer monitors use magnets
 computer hard discs and audio and video cassettes have magnetic material that store information
 magnets are used in picking up substances made of iron from scrapyard
magnet an object that attracts substances like iron cobalt and nickel is called magnet
magnetic compass an instrument with a magnet that is used to find directions is called magnetic compass
temporary magnets magnets that retain their magnetic properties only for a short period of time are called temporary magnets
permanent magnets magnets that retain their magnetic properties for a long period of time are called permanent magnets
only magnetic materials are attracted by magnets
magnetic forces are the strongest at the poles of the magnet
a freely suspended magnet will come to rest in the earth’s north-south direction
like poles of two magnets repel each other
unlike poles of two magnets attract each other
magnets can lose their properties if they are dropped from a height hit with a hammer heated or stored in an improper manner
water cycle is like a ring
in nature the water cycle takes place from sea to land and back to sea again
three states of water  water can exist in all the three states—solid liquid and gas
 liquid state the water that we use in everyday life is a liquid
it is called liquid state of water
 gaseous state we have learnt that on heating water evaporates to form its vapour
water vapour is its gaseous state
 solid state water turns into ice on cooling
ice is the solid form of water
 these three states of water are interconvertible to each other that is we can change it from one state to another
 the easy interconvertibility of water from one state to other makes its availability in all parts of the earth and throughout the year
 evaporation takes place from open surfaces of water all the time— day and night
 evaporation of water takes place continuously from oceans rivers lakes wells and soil
oceans seas rivers lakes ponds and wells together are often known as water bodies
 during the day time sunlight falls on the water in oceans rivers lakes
the fields roads rooftops and other land areas also receive sunlight
the sunlight also carries heat with it
as a result water from oceans rivers lakes and the soil and other land areas gets continuously changed into vapour
 thus water vapour gets continuously added to air due to evaporation
transpiration  transpiration it is the loss of water from the leaves of plants in the form of vapour
 every plant whether it is in a crop field a forest on the roadside or in a kitchen garden transpires to give off water vapour
the amount of water vapour that goes into air through the process of transpiration is very huge
condensation  condensation the process of conversion of vapour into liquid form of water is called condensation
 the process of condensation is opposite to evaporation
 cloud formation the climate close to the earth’s surface is warm
it gets cooled as one goes up in atmosphere
water vapour being lighter rises up in the atmosphere
at the upper layer of atmosphere where the temperature is lower the vapour gets condensed into tiny water droplets and forms clouds
it may so happen that many droplets of water come together to form larger sized drops of water
such drops of water may become so heavy that they begin to fall
falling of water drops is called precipitation
 rain if the water during precipitation remains liquid till it reaches the surface of the earth we have rains
 hailsnow sometimes precipitation may be in the form of hail or snow
water in a hail or snow is in its frozen or solid form
 dew many times especially during winter nights the air near the surface becomes quite cool
as a result the water vapour present in it condenses to form water droplets
these water droplets appear as dew
water back to ocean the water that falls on the land as rain and snow sooner or later goes back to oceans
this may happen in many ways
uses of water  it is needed for drinking bathing washing cleaning of vessels toilets flushing etc
therefore water is essential for our life
 water helps animals and plants to cool
 water is essential for the germination of seeds
 water is required for irrigation of the crops
 water is used to generate electricity
 water wheel is used to run flour mills
 water is used in many industries like paper rayon petroleum refining fertilizers dyes drugs and other chemical industries
 water is used in car radiators to keep the engine cool
 in cold countries people use water to warm their houses
 water is used to keep the things cool
sources of water rivers and springs most of the water which human beings use for drinking washing and farming comes from rivers and springs
the river flows down the mountain side and across the land finally flowing into a sea or an ocean
oceans and seas most of the water on the earth is found in the oceans and seas
however the water found in the oceans and seas is not fit for drinking or agricultural purposes as it contains large amount of salt
however ocean acts as a habitat for large number of plants and animals
snow some regions of the earth are covered with snow especially during winters
water formed by melting of snow is another source of water
sometimes this water flows down in the form of streams and rivers
streams and rivers are another sources of water
groundwater the ground water is actually rainwater which mainly comes from seepage of water accumulated under the ground
water table if you take soil from ground it has air as well as water
as you go down the amount of water increases and air decreases
a level below surface where it is only water is called the water table
lakes and ponds these are small reservoirs of water
these are created by collection of rainwater in low lying areas
seepage from the groundwater reserves also adds to the water in lakes and ponds
rain the rain is a very important source of water for us
all resources of water are fed mainly by rains
natural calamities the conditions of flooding and drought are called natural calamities
drought if it does not rain for a year or more at a place the soil will lose its water by evaporation and becomes dry
water will also be lost through transpiration process from the plants
rivers ponds and wells will dry and the water table would lower down
all this will affect the humans animals and wild plants
if it continues for one or two years consecutively it results into drought
consequences of drought the result of drought may be no crops
the availability of food and fodder will decrease
the overall consequence of such a situation will lead to loss of life of humans and animals
the soil surface will get laden with water resulting into flood
consequences of flood when the soil gets too much of water air in the soil comes out of it
due to lack of air the animals living inside the soil also come out of it
heavy rainfall also results in the loss of crops due to flood
factors responsible for flood a number of factors are responsible for flood
these factors can be intensity and duration of rainfall soil condition and presence of plants or trees on the ground
water conservation  it is very important that water should be used carefully
we should take care that water should not get wasted
 it is not necessary that the water used in the garden is fit for drinking
yet most often we water the gardens with drinking water supplied by the corporation
we should use water for gardening that has already been used in the kitchen for washing vegetables and fruits etc
 always be careful that the water tank in your house doesn’t overflow when it is being filled
 don’t use a hose pipe to wash your car or scooter
 if you leave the tap running while brushing your teeth about  litres of water get used up
fill a mug with water and use instead
rainwater harvesting  water harvesting is the activity of collection of rainwater directly by various means
 harvested water can either be used immediately or it can be stored for later use
 in kerala and mizoram where it rains almost the whole year round small tanks are used to collect rainwater which drains from rooftops through pipes into these tanks
this water is used directly
 in a place like delhi where the monsoon lasts only for  months it is more useful to collect rainwater as groundwater
clouds when water vapour goes up where temperature is low it gets condensed into tiny water droplets and forms clouds
condensation the process of conversion of vapour into liquid form of water is called condensation
drought if it does not rain for one or two years consecutively at a place it is known as drought
evaporation process of conversion of water into water vapour is called evaporation
the soil surface will get laden with water resulting into flood
groundwater the groundwater is actually rainwater which mainly comes from seepage of water accumulated under the ground
hail sometimes during precipitation of water droplets water freezes and takes the form of hail
ocean ocean is the biggest body of water surrounding the globe
rainwater harvesting rainwater harvesting is the activity of collection of rainwater by various means
snow it is the condition similar to the formation of hail
water vapour water exists in three forms—solid liquid and gas
gaseous form of the water is called water vapour
water cycle it is the circulation of water through the process of evaporation and rain or snowfall
water available for use about three-fourth of the earth’s surface is covered with water
that is why it is also called the water planet
but do you know how much water is readily available for use most of the water about % is in the seas and oceans as salt water
this water is too salty to be used for drinking and irrigation
thus only a tiny fraction about % of the earth’s water is available to us as freshwater
% is locked up in the mountains or glaciers or is buried so deep under that it costs too much to extract
% of the fresh water is easily available to us in the form of groundwater river lake stream soil moisture and water vapour
uses of water besides being essential for life water is used for many other purposes
in india about % of the total water available is used for agriculture - % by industries and only % is used for personal or domestic needs
 shows a pie chart that gives the percentage use of water
let us learn more about the various uses of water
agricultural needs our country depends a lot on agriculture
farmers rely on water to sustain their agricultural crops e
many times rainfall is not sufficient to water these crops and farmers have to use artificial watering systems referred to as irrigation
the amount of required depends on the kind and size of the factory and water
personaldomestic needs we need water to drink
water that is suitable for drinking is called potable water
we also need water to bathe wash clothes and dishes clean our house and to water plants
apart from these uses water is also used for transportation and recreation fig
it also regulates the climate of a place and provides homes to many animals
different states of water in nature water exists in three states
it could be in the form of liquid e
 rain river sea solid e
 ice snow hail or gas e
you can heat water over a stove to convert it into vapour
what happens if you leave water in an uncovered vessel on a summer afternoon outside your house after a few hours you will find that the level of water in the vessel has decreased
this is because a lot of it would have escaped into the atmosphere in the form of water vapour
the process by which a liquid is converted to its vapour is called evaporation
water vapour is also added into the air by the leaves of plants through the process of transpiration
evaporation and condensation of water take place on a very large scale on the surface of the earth and its atmosphere
these processes play a key role in cloud formation and rain
cloud formation when the temperature of air increases it expands i
 its particles move away from one another
this makes the air lighter and it rises in the atmosphere taking water vapour with it
as the air rises it begins to cool
the water vapour condenses on dust particles present in the atmosphere to form millions of tiny droplets
tiny ice crystals will be formed instead if it is very cold
this cluster of tiny water droplets floating in the air is what we call a cloud
water cycle water droplets in the clouds keep bumping against one another and sometimes stick to form bigger drops
when these drops become too heavy to float in the air they drop down back to the earth as rain
the water that comes down as rain in time evaporates and goes up to form clouds again
this leads to forming a cycle known as the water cycle
the water cycle is the cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes
 shows how the water cycle works
transpiration plants give off water vapour through their leaves
condensation water vapour rises up and condenses on dust particles to form clouds
precipitation water stored in clouds reaches earth in the form of rain snow etc
collection some rainwater seeps into the ground forming groundwater
rainwater also flows into streams and rivers and then finds its way into seas and oceans
drought sometimes it does not rain for a long time—for an entire month two months the whole season two years etc
the abnormally long period of insufficient or no rainfall at all is called drought
during drought rivers run dry the water level in lakes goes down and even the water in the soil dries up fig
most plants die leading to a lack of food in the region
the lack of food in a region for a long period is called famine
when there are no plants animals that survive on plants also die
animals and humans also die due to thirst and dehydration excessive loss of water from the body
flood just as too little rain is bad too much rain is bad as well
it leads to water being everywhere sometimes the entire area remains under water or submerged
a condition when the ground becomes submerged under water due to heavy rain and overflowing of rivers is called flood
during a flood plants and crops die either due to suffocation by excess water or due to the soil being washed away robbing their roots of support
in such waterlogged conditions many disease-causing germs start multiplying and cause water-borne diseases
sometimes water-borne diseases affect thousands of people at the same time
a disease affecting thousands of people at the same time is called an epidemic
a flood also can have the same effect on the food chain as a drought does
both drought and flood are natural disasters—unfortunate events brought about by nature—that can have a very strong effect on the lives of people
the economy of a country can crumble as a result of the loss of property and life and many more things
but we can and must try to reduce the bad effects of these disasters as much as possible
we must understand that such things can happen and so we must be prepared to face them as and when they happen
conservation of water since only a small percentage of water on our planet is usable it is very important that we use water carefully
conservation of water can be done by building dams avoiding wastage of water at homes both indoors and outdoors harvesting rainwater and preventing pollution of water
building dam a dam is a structure built to hold back water in order to prevent floods and to provide water for irrigation and storage
building a dam is a solution to both drought and flood fig
dams are also used in producing electricity
during heavy rainfall when the rivers fill up water enters the dam
when water is needed later the gates are opened to let out water
avoiding wastage at homes some ways to avoid wastage of water at homes are given below
rainwater harvesting the process of collecting and storing rainwater from roofs or a surface catchment is called rainwater harvesting fig
storing rainwater that collects on roofs instead of letting it go down the drain is a practical solution in case of droughts
this technique is known as rooftop rainwater harvesting
this involves collecting rainwater from rooftops in dugout ponds vessels or underground tanks to store water for long periods
another option is to allow water to go into the ground directly from the roadside drains that collect rainwater
the stored rainwater is treated before use because it may contain bird faeces chemicals and other pollutants which need to be removed before use
garbage and harmful chemicals pollute the water and make it unfit for use
 is also very bad for aquatic life
plants and animals in and around polluted water may die or get infected
and when human beings consume contaminated fish etc
 they are also put at risk of diseases
saltwater water of the seas and oceans that has high salt content making it unfit for drinking and irrigation is called salt water
irrigation watering crops by artificial means is called irrigation
potable water water fit for human consumption is called potable water
transpiration the release of water vapour into the atmosphere through the leaves of plants is called transpiration
water cycle the cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes is called the water cycle
drought abnormally long period of insufficient or no rainfall is called drought
famine lack of food in a region for a long period is called famine
flood a condition when the ground becomes submerged under water due to heavy rain and overflowing of rivers is called flood
epidemic a disease affecting thousands of people at the same time is called an epidemic
dam a structure built on a river to store and hold back water is called a dam
rainwater harvesting the process of collecting and storing rainwater from roofs or a surface catchment is called rainwater harvesting
only a tiny fraction of the earth’s water is available as fresh water
all living things have a lot of water in their body
almost % of our body weight contains water
it is home to various plants and animals
water exists in solid liquid and gaseous states
evaporation and condensation play an important role in cloud formation
the water cycle is the cyclic movement of water from the atmosphere to the earth and back to the atmosphere through various processes
the abnormally long period of insufficient or no rainfall is known as drought
when there is too much rainfall in an area rivers overflow and water cover all the area around
this is called a flood
a flood can cause great destruction
rainwater harvesting is one of the ways to conserve water
air air is a mixture of different gases
properties of air  it is colourless i
 it has no colour and taste
 it is transparent i
 we can see through it
it fills all the space in a container which is otherwise empty and seems to be empty
 air exerts pressure in all directions
smoke these are the dark-coloured gases caused by burning of anything
weathercock it shows the direction in which the air is moving at that place
composition of air  air is not one substance but is a mixture
 air is a mixture of some gases water vapour and dust particles
 the gases in the air are mainly nitrogen oxygen a small amount of carbon dioxide and some other gases
 when air comes in contact with a cool surface it gets cooled and fog appears
 the presence of water vapour in the air is important for the water cycle in nature
dust particles  air contains dust particles
 the presence of dust particles in air varies from place to place and time to time
oxygen  the component of air that supports burning is called oxygen
 oxygen is necessary for the survival of all living beings
it is required in respiration
 percentage of oxygen in the air is around 
nitrogen  the major part of the air is nitrogen
it takes up four-fifth of the space be around 
 nitrogen does not support burning
carbon dioxide  carbon dioxide makes up a small component 
% of air around us
 it causes a feeling of suffocation
 all materials when they burn consume oxygen and produce carbon dioxide
 it is also produced along with water vapour during respiration
 plants need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and to live
this thin layer is called the atmosphere
 the atmosphere extends up to several kilometres
 the air becomes thinner and thinner as we go high up from the surface of the earth
 the atmosphere is quite active due to the movement of air with respect to the earth
 the processes like cloud formation thundering rain etc
 occur in the atmosphere
uses of air uses of air  air exerts force on objects that come in its way
this property of air is quite useful
 fun like firkins pinwheel is based on the force applied by air
 the air current makes the windmills to rotate
 air also helps in dispersal of seeds and pollens of flowers
 compressed air is used in tyres of vehicles
 nitrogen is used on a large scale to manufacture fertilizers
 winnowing is possible only because of the air
 air is also useful for playing several musical instruments
 birds bats and many insects fly in the air
 we cannot hear the sounds in the absence of air
 various components of airplay various important roles
atmosphere the envelope of air that surrounds the earth is known as the atmosphere
carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is a gas produced during respiration
it is used by plants for photosynthesis
composition of air air is a mixture of nitrogen oxygen carbon dioxide water vapour and a few other gases
nitrogen it is the major portion of our atmosphere
smoke these are the dark-coloured mixture of gases produced due to the burning of anything
windmill windmill is a huge apparatus which is rotated by wind
it is used to draw water from tube wells and to run flour mills
air is all around us a thick blanket of air called the atmosphere surrounds our earth
air is also present in things which seem to be empty
let us find this out by doing an activity
composition of air it contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen
it also contains carbon dioxide noble gases water vapour dust particles and traces of other gases
the composition of air is shown in figure 
let us now verify the presence of some constituents of air
oxygen in air supports burning whereas nitrogen does not
let us prove this by doing a simple activity
carbon dioxide air contains about 
plants and animals take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide during respiration
when you burn something carbon dioxide is also produced
water vapour air contains varying amounts of water vapour depending on the weather of a place
you have learnt about the water cycle
the sun heats up the water in the seas and oceans
this water evaporates and forms water vapour
you can verify the presence of water vapour in air by observing wet clothes drying on a clothesline fig
where does the water from these wet clothes disappear the water from the wet clothes forms water vapour and mixes with the air
air also contains smoke released from factories and vehicles fig
air supports life we all need air to survive
air contains oxygen and carbon dioxide useful to plants and animals
plants use carbon dioxide of the air to make their own food by a process called photosynthesis
let us see how air supports life in plants and animals
air containing carbon dioxide and oxygen enters the plant through these openings where it gets used in photosynthesis and respiration
in animals all animals need to respire be it a cockroach a fish or an elephant
sometimes we wrongly use the terms of breathing and respiration interchangeably
breathing is a physical act of taking in oxygen and giving out carbon dioxide whereas respiration is a chemical process by which glucose in the body breaks down to give energy
gills help to take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide
some aquatic animals like dolphin and whale come to the surface of the water regularly to take in air since they breathe with the help of the lungs
aquatic plants like hydrilla also breathe in oxygen dissolved in water through their stomata
in amphibians amphibians like frog newt and salamander need breathing systems for both air and water
crocodile and alligator swim through water with part of their snout above the water surface to breathe easily through nostrils
in birds birds have an efficient respiratory system as they need high levels of oxygen during flight
birds have a pair of lungs with air sacs that remain open all the time so that air can easily pass through them
they take in oxygen and give out carbon dioxide
balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the air the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is maintained through respiration in plants and animals and by photosynthesis in plants
plants produce oxygen during photosynthesis and utilize oxygen during respiration
they produce much more oxygen during photosynthesis than they consume during respiration this is how the oxygen consumed by plants and to a large extent by animals is replenished in the air through photosynthesis
air pollution the addition of substances in the environment in quantities that are harmful to live beings is called pollution
air is getting polluted day by day because of various human activities
burning of fuels like coal and petroleum excessive burning of fuels like wood smoke and harmful gases released from industries fig
 smoke released by vehicles fig
 and machines releasing gases are the major causes of air pollution
these gases spread and mix in the air and spoil the quality of air thereby making it impure
air pollution has major adverse effects on plants animals as well as human beings
air pollution also leads to a lot of lung disease like asthma and lung cancer
air pollution also damages crops
if we do not start looking after the quality of air around us the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels will no longer be balanced and living beings will be the ones getting affected
there are a number of ways by which we can reduce air pollution
some of them are planting more and more trees recycling plastics regular checking of vehicles for the emission of harmful gases etc
atmosphere a thick blanket of air pollution the addition of substances in the surrounding the earth’s surface is called the environment in quantities that are the harmful atmosphere
to living beings is called pollution
air cannot be seen but can be felt when it moves
air is a mixture of several gases
oxygen is needed for respiration
carbon dioxide is given out as a by-product after respiration
insects take in air with the help of tiny holes in their bodies called spiracles earthworm breathes through their skin which is kept moist with the help of a substance called mucus
some aquatic animals like whale and dolphin as well as mammals breathe with the help of lungs
amphibians like frog breathe with the help of lungs when on land
in water these animals breathe with the help of their moist skin
birds breathe through lungs and air sacs that are open all the time
there are several causes of air pollution excessive burning of fuels like wood coal and petroleum machines releasing gases vehicles releasing smoke and several types of harmful gases released by industries
hospital waste includes bandages cotton impulse injection bottles tablet wrappers cut out plaster syringes glucose bottles needles papers corks instruments tubes fruit peelings and seeds
mostly wastes are used for filling the low lying areas
these things pollute the soil and are responsible for several fatal diseases
many people sort out syringes tubes needles and other reusable instruments wash them and reuse them which become the cause of many diseases
the filling materials diffuse in the soil and pollute the soil
dustbins the utensil or space where the waste material is collected is called dustbin
green dustbins generally we use green dustbin for collecting biodegradable waste
blue dustbins the non-biodegradable wastes which do not decompose naturally are kept in blue dustbin
the edible wastes which are thrown by people in the -polythene bags and eaten up by cow pig dog etc
 are not digested in their alimentary canal as a result of which the cattle become patients
polythene and plastics are very useful in our lives but are non- biodegradable
unnecessary use of plastic and polythene should be checked
we should try to use paper and jute bags as much as possible
‘r’ we should use ‘r’ for checking the increase of waste matter
the first ‘r’ means ‘reduce’
the meaning of the second ‘r’ is ‘reuse’ and the meaning of the third ‘r’ is ‘recycling’
we should use things in maximum which are biodegradable
waste material every person creates rags and throws all those things which he has used once and does not use it again
these things are commonly called waste materials
landfill waste material faeces of animals kitchen waste garden waste etc
 are collected in dustbins from where it is thrown out into the low lying areas for filling a purpose
compost the manure made up by kitchen wastes and garden wastes is called compost manure
it increases the fertility of the soil
garbage all the used or unusable substances which cannot be reused in the same form is called garbage
recycling it is a process in which a material which has been used once is recycled to produce something to reuse
segregation of wastes garbage or waste may be in the form of fruit or vegetable peels discarded objects wrapping materials wasted food as household garbage or discarded chemicals and fertilizers washed into rivers domestic sewage etc
these wastes can be segregated into biodegradable and non- biodegradable
dead plants and animals and their products e
 fruit and vegetable peels paper and leaves decay very easily these wastes mix with the soil and produce manure
wastes that do not rot by the action of decomposers are called non-biodegradable wastes
for example glass plastic and metals
many of them can be recycled to produce new things
this will help in easy sorting and recycling of wastes to make beneficial products
best out of waste the rock garden in chandigarh is an excellent example of how solid wastes can be utilized
every item in this garden is made from waste materials like tyres plastic bottles eggshells and tube lights
this innovative idea of utilizing solid waste has made the rock garden very popular tourist attraction
 by burying them in compost pits is called composting
composting is a simple and almost effortless process of recycling
there is also a different kind of composting where a kind of earthworm called red worms or red wrigglers act on wastes and degrade them
this type of composting with the help of a type of earthworm called red worms is called vermicomposting fig
vermicompost can be made in - weeks and it appears as loose soil-like material
landfills large areas used for waste disposal are called landfills
the landfill is another method to manage a huge amount of biodegradable waste
in a landfill garbage is buried in such a way that it does not damage the environment fig
garbage buried inside landfills stay here for a long time as it decomposes very slowly
after a landfill is full it can be converted into a park
management of non-biodegradable wastes as non-biodegradable wastes like plastic bags glass bottles etc
 cannot be broken down by decomposers their disposal poses a big problem
non-biodegradable wastes can be managed by practising the concept of  rs—reduce reuse and recycle
reduce we need to reduce the amount of waste generated by consuming more and throwing away less
we often buy more things than we really need
nowadays disposable items have become popular for example ballpoint pen plastic bag disposable napkins etc
we are using them frequently without giving a thought to their hazardous effects
reuse we can reuse certain things for more than one purpose
if we reuse them for other purposes we can help in reducing waste
here are some of the tips for reusing things  small jars and bottles can be cleaned to keep some other kitchen stuff
 one should prefer glass bottle to metal can when buying juice or soft drink
the bottles can be refilled
 old clothes can be made into other usable items like cushion cover handkerchief etc
 old mobile phones can be donated to friends or family
recycle the process by which waste materials are used to make new products is called recycling
materials like glass metal plastic and paper are collected separated and recycled to make new things
recycling of plastics bucket bottle toy shoe bag pen and comb are a few things made of plastic
use of plastics has become a major concern nowadays because they are non-biodegradable and release harmful gases upon heating or burning
they can also contaminate foodstuffs
if eaten by animals plastics can choke and kill them
therefore one should reduce and reuse plastic items as far as possible
when plastic items are to be discarded they should be recycled to make new things
not all the plastics generated are recycled hence causing much damage to life on earth
in many places in india plastics are totally banned seeing its adverse effects on the environment
some of the ways to reduce reuse and recycle plastics are as follows  paper cotton and jute bag should be preferred over plastic bags fig
 empty bottles can be refilled for storage of water or any other liquid stuff
think about the number of times you buy a bottle of water when you are out
instead you can fill the used bottle and carry it whenever you are out
 zip foils can be reused after cleaning thoroughly each time after storing foodstuffs
recycling of paper paper is made from trees and trees are essential for our survival on earth
so even if paper is biodegradable depletion of trees at a fast pace is a big concern
therefore to save trees we must use paper carefully
some of the ways to save paper are  we should always write on both sides of paper sheets
 unused pages from old notebooks can be torn off and made into a new notebook for doing rough work and other miscellaneous work
 we can also reuse envelopes and covers by using stickers to write new addresses
 we can also make fresh paper from old newspapers
but by following the rs concept we can manage the garbage generated in our surroundings so that it is beneficial to the environment
biodegradable wastes wastes that rot by the action of decomposers are called biodegradable wastes
non-biodegradable wastes wastes that do not rot by the action of decomposers are called non-biodegradable wastes
 by burying them in compost pits is called composting
vermicomposting composting with the help of a type of earthworm called red worms is called vermicomposting
landfills large areas used for waste disposal are called landfills
recycling the process by which waste materials are used to make new products is called recycling
there are mainly two types of wastes based on their ability to rot over a period of time biodegradable and non-biodegradable wastes
dead plants and animals and their products decay while objects like plastic and glass do not
vermicomposting and landfills are two ways of managing solid wastes
by practising the concept of rs reduce reuse and recycle we can manage our wastes well
